She thought it was disgusting.\u0027         In his defence evidence Dr Gelder (pictured outside the Medical Practitioners Tribunal in Manchester) told the hearing he had apologised to both women in writing and had also a attended a course on maintaining professional boundariesNurse A then said she did not want to speak to Dr Gelder, nor work or see him again, Mr Taylor continued.  \u0027When she got to the fridge to pick up some medication for a patient, Dr Gelder was at the fridge and he said: Oh, just got her. \u0027He was laughing and she was in shock and found it inappropriate and not funny, so she walked away.\u0027Before she walked away she told him the only person allowed to do that to her was her husband and he replied Well, he\u0027s a very lucky man. \u0027The hearing was told the second incident occurred later that same day after another female colleague known as Miss B wanted to speak to Dr Gelder about patients who had been treated the previous day.Mr Taylor added: \u0027She told him the patients were not assessed properly downstairs and he had not written in the notes. \u0027They discussed this and Dr Gelder responded saying: You\u0027re sexy when you are cross. \u0027Miss B was surprised and taken aback as he had not spoken to her in that way before. He then walked away.\u0027He accepts he squeezed the nurse\u0027s bottom whilst undertaking the ward round and accepts saying the inappropriate comment you\u0027re sexy when you are cross.\u0027However, he does not accept his actions were sexually motivated saying he never had any such conscious thought and that it was an immature intention to behave in a jokey way.\u0027He thought it could possibly be a reaction to a substance called Valerian, which can be found in Pet Remedy and thought it could possibly be a reaction with the antihistamine he was taking.\u0027The tribunal was told an oral dose of 70ml of Valerian also called Fexofenadine had been shown in reports to alter excitability.Medical expert Dr Johann Grundlingh said: \u0027We know already that the potential effects of Fexofenadine could include delirium and stimulation and it is well known that drugs causing delirium and stimulation may lead to sexually disinhibition and inappropriate behaviour.\u0027Thus, a mild delirium and stimulation caused by Fexofenadine may have led to a degree of disinhibition and inappropriate behaviour, but this conclusion is more tenuous than my previous conclusion stating that Fexofenadine may have explained his symptoms of \u0027mind racing, dizziness, fainting, abnormal dreams, restlessness and nausea.\u0027In his defence evidence Dr Gelder, who has also been a Clinical Lead for a project which helps COPD sufferers, told the hearing he had apologised to both women in writing and had also a attended a course on maintaining professional boundaries.He said: \u0027I had arrived at work at 8am and was experiencing feelings of euphoria. At the time I thought I could do anything and I thought I was Superman. I think if it was a male nurse I even would have done the same to them too.\u0027I know it was a disgusting thing to do but it\u0027s never happened before. I just woke up feeling euphoric. \u0027I told the Trust I would happily expose myself to Pet Remedy again to confirm the effects. \u0027I was absolutely stunned at what happened. I have never behaved in that way before or since. Touching her bottom was inappropriate, it was a stupid idea and a practical joke.But in a statement, the nurse said: \u0027What Dr Gelder did to me made me feel dirty and cheap, he shouldn\u0027t have done it as when I explained to him that he shouldn\u0027t have done that to me, he responded by saying my husband is a lucky man.\u0027It\u0027s disgusting.

Friends have expressed disbelief when he told them of her carnal offer and he admits ‘part of me was certainly ready’. Instead, he reminded himself of his young family. A few years earlier, both virgins, he had married his high-school sweetheart in the Canadian town near Niagara Falls where he’d grown up.‘I was an innocent (very innocent), sexually supercharged guy in my mid-20,’ he recalled.‘I didn’t respond because I was busy loading my film and continuing to take pictures.’Kirkland believes the pictures he got wouldn’t have been so good if he’d got into bed with his subject. ‘We were both on such a fine, teetering edge,’ he said.‘Ultimately all of that fused energy was channelled directly into the lens.’As the shoot started to wind down, he felt a ‘warm satisfying sense of relief, almost as if we’d had sex’.He ended up lying on the floor next to her bed and they chatted about their lives and beliefs.          Monroe, he added, ‘was just being Marilyn and playing to the camera as she knew how to do very well’. Friends have expressed disbelief when he told them of her carnal offer and he admits ‘part of me was certainly ready’‘She told me about her difficult beginnings and I told her about coming from a small town in Canada and never dreaming I would some day be photographing the goddess she had become.’Twenty minutes later, he got up and let the others back in. They didn’t finally leave until well past midnight. Kirkland said he had trouble sleeping that night at the Chateau Marmont hotel as he thought about what might have been.‘We had nearly been lovers an hour earlier and now she was gone,’ he said. ‘The Marilyn Monroe I had been with on that night of the shoot unquestionably took a firm hold on me.‘She arrived in a misty vision, and when she left it was as if she had evaporated. I admitted to myself with some embarrassment that I missed her already.’However, the spell was well and truly broken the following evening as he pitched up at Monroe’s home with a spring in his step to show her the pictures he’d taken.She answered the door wearing sunglasses and a scarf over her head. She sounded ‘drawn, tired and disturbed’ and didn’t look like she’d slept at all.Kirkland said he reviewed the photos with a ‘darker, sadder’ woman than the ‘breathy, sexy beauty’ he had photographed.He’d been pleased with them but she bluntly told him they ‘aren’t great’ and cut up half of them with scissors.However, her mood improved and she finally found one she liked — of her clutching a pillow the way she’d clutch a lover.This was the girl who men would want to sleep with, she told him, using the third person to describe herself.They left on a positive note, with Marilyn telling him: ‘I want to do this with you again, real soon!’Nine months later, he was in Paris when he saw the headlines that she was dead.‘I was in disbelief and heartbroken like the rest of the world,’ he said. The pictures are some of the last professional photos that were taken of Monroe.Kirkland’s success with her proved the making of his career, especially with beautiful actresses. He photographed Julie Christie, Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn.But, he says, he still ‘gets a buzz’ of remembering his moment with Marilyn, a woman who could wield her sex appeal with ruthless efficiency."},{"url":null,"title":"Do deal today says former Remain campaign chief STUART ROSE","story":"Share this article Once a deal is done the Government can say: Let\u0027s invest in infrastructure, let\u0027s get policies in place to make the UK the best possible place to do business.It will also leave us free to deal with other issues that have been on ice, such as education, training, skills and infrastructure planning.

Pairing early works by the late Scottish painter Alan Davie (1920-2014) and David Hockney, the gallery sets out to acknowledge Davie’s influence on the younger Hockney, who took what he needed from the older artist and moved on, while Davie was still struggling to escape, most notably from Jackson Pollock. A second, attendant exhibition at the Hepworth, of American painter Christina Quarles, allows us to look at her work in the light of Hockney.Davie’s earlier work was altogether too clamorous, clogged and beefy, and only by ditching all those layers of mark-making did he get anywhere close to the lightness and airy spaces of the best of Pollock’s all-over paintings. At times Davie’s art took a Pollock turn, a Miró turn, a Sam Francis turn.In Davie’s art, heavy symbolism gave way to love-hearts, cleavages, buttocks, penis tips, hairy balls and pudenda. Words emerged, alongside squiggles, flurries and jumbly scribblings. “Glory” says one painting, in a sudden lapse into language. Next to it hangs an early Hockney, with the word “Love” written over the smeary, faecal forms.Not yet 40, Davie held a retrospective at the former Wakefield Art Gallery in 1958, where it was seen by Hockney, then completing his national service before enrolling at the Royal College of Art the following year. The stray drips, the dirtied whites, the umbers, blacks and furry edges – all of which were familiar in British painting in the 1950s, and as much a continuation of European art informel as from American abstract expressionism – as well as the words got into Hockney’s work.“Queen”, “thrust”, and most famously, “We 2 boys together clinging”, were more than random painterly mutterings, and open provocation in the art of the early 60s. While Hockney was being openly gay, and quoting Walt Whitman, Davie had begun adding brushed-on phrases: MANGO TIME, PEACH TIME, BANANA TIME to otherwise abstract canvases. You can take these, I suppose, as sexual euphemisms.At the time of Davie’s 1958 show, the critic David Sylvester described him in terms of the “vehemence, sensuousness and generosity of great Romantic painting”. Give me banana time any day. Davie had a parallel life as a free-jazz musician, and as he began making his art more improvisational, so Hockney got more cool and sophisticated, ditching spattery grubbiness and physicality in favour of arch pictorial quotations, irony and games with different levels of abstraction and figuration. Queering painting as much as he was celebrating his own sexuality.Which also provides a starting point for the work of Quarles. Born in 1984 and based in Los Angeles, Quarles’s large-scale paintings are filled with female bodies that extrude and bloat, stretch, slither, dangle and droop. Sometimes they get entangled as they clutch, quiver, kiss, caress and morph in all sorts of unlikely directions. And this is to say nothing as yet about the ways in which she paints these lascivious, fraught beings.The painting keeps changing tack. Stencilled patterns give way to modelled and shaded limbs that then suddenly lose their three-dimensionality and become flat outlines, or turn into cartoonish drawing. Heads fade into washy silhouette under wodges of thickly painted and combed hair. Bodies go all harlequin-patterned, the scrabbling and clutching hands turn from the sensual to the mechanical.There is a lot going on. Sometimes we are taken back to Hockney’s work from the 60s, and his own experiment with degrees and styles of representation. Quarles quotes his California swimming-pool paintings with her own white ripples on blue water. One can link to gear shifts in Hockney’s Rocky Mountains and Tired Indians, or in his Man in a Museum (You’re in the Wrong Movie) to the disjunctures in Quarles’ paintings. But as much as Hockney is in Quarles’ art, so you can also find hints of the body distortions in the self-portraits of Austrian painter Maria Lassnig, and in the paintings of US-based British painter Nicola Tyson in Quarles’ work.Born to a white mother and black father, Quarles is pale-skinned, and often taken as white. The figures in her paintings refuse the normative. Her bodies exist in complex, interdependent ways with the spaces they inhabit. She has a complicated relationship to her artistic peers and forebears. As with Davie, and so with Hockney, we are all somehow under the influence, learning to escape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b99670e551f44545ca84c73835e800b29769e72b/0_138_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14e8959c7f9b7561c183c3a8ade5e3bc","title":"buy a classic guardian photograph westonbirt arboretum","story":"Our weekly series of exclusive  print sales continues with an autumnal shot of trees, photographed by Felix Clay, November 2013 The afternoon sun casts long and elegant shadows in a clearing at Westonbirt arboretum, Gloucestershire, captured by the  photographer Felix Clay, who died in May 2019 after a long illness.

With days to go before the opening, there is still no sign of whether one of the major works will appear.The Louvre’s vast Leonardo da Vinci exhibition to mark 500 years since the death of the Italian Renaissance master will finally open next week as the world’s most-visited museum prepares to handle a huge influx of visitors.One of the most expensive exhibitions ever staged in France, it is the first time that such a large number of Leonardo’s drawings, sketches, writings and paintings have ever been brought together.But a question mark still hangs over whether Salvator Mundi — the world’s most expensive painting — will be loaned. Mystery surrounds who owns the painting, a depiction of Jesus in Renaissance dress, which was once thought to be held in the Gulf. Unusually, the exhibition space has been designed to accommodate pictures arriving or being refused at the last minute. “We’ve never been in this situation before,” a museum representative said.Leonardo, whose life has been a constant source of myth-making, is considered a visionary genius – a painter, scientist, engineer and inventor. Born the illegitimate son of a notary in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci in 1452, the Italian humanist worked in Florence and Milan, and spent his final years at the court of the French king Francis I in the Loire, where he died on 2 May 1519. Since then what is known on his life has been pored over and seized upon his vegetarianism and interest in animal welfare have been cited by French anti-hunting groups while the androgynous faces in many of his portraits are considered by some as a modern questioning of gender.At the heart of the Louvre’s exhibition are the lessons that can be learned about Leonardo’s personality from the awe-inspiring realism in his work: portraits such as La Belle Ferronnière, the Mona Lisa or his depiction of Saint John the Baptist.Leonardo painted relatively little – there are only about 15 remaining paintings – of which nine are in this show. He worked painstakingly slowly, often spending more than a decade on a painting. The exhibition includes many of his outstanding drawings. The curators argue that his interest in science – particularly astronomy, botany and his constant grappling with mathematical problems – was not a digression that pulled him away from art, but was central to his quest to achieve perfection in his painting.“He had an ability not just to depict things from the outside, but to also show what was inside: the movement and vibration of life, the inner emotions,” said Louis Frank, one of the show’s curators.Yet the Mona Lisa – one of the main attractions for the Louvre’s 30,000 visitors a day – will remain upstairs in its usual permanent hanging place. The temporary exhibition space devoted to the Leonardo show can only accommodate 7,000 people per day and the museum did not want to prevent other visitors seeing it. There will also be a virtual reality experience of the Mona Lisa for the first time. As the Louvre faces ever higher visitor numbers, the Leonardo exhibition will only be open to people who have pre-booked.The whole exhibition was in danger last year when Leonardo was dragged into a long-running political spat between Italy’s then far-right ruling League party and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. Italy said it would cancel the loan of some paintings, accusing France of trying to take centre stage in the commemorations marking 500 years since the painter’s death. “Leonardo is Italian he only died in France,” one far-right MP said.The row was finally resolved but then a last-minute legal challenge this month nearly stopped da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man – a study in anatomical proportions – from appearing. An Italian heritage group said the drawing, which is kept in a climate-controlled vault at the Accademia Gallery of Venice, was too fragile to travel and risked being damaged by lighting in the Louvre if displayed for a long period. A court ruled the work could travel. It is currently in transit, and will arrive next week to be shown for a limited period.Vincent Delieuvin, one of the show’s curators, said the exhibition would explain how Leonardo established that the secret to creating perfect paintings that laid bare human nature was to capture light, shade and movement. For Leonardo, it was about opening one’s mind to “an absolute freedom” in drawing and painting, Delieuvin said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093c14d1ee284fcaffa0238cce3edb5572e70579/0_288_6588_3954/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e42698756a9f68769022ce8733ebe0e","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Turkey’s military offensive against Kurdish forces, the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, and Eliud Kipchoge breaking the two-hour marathon barrier – the past seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ffd86603f47cc6c3c460e7a3c6a13bd0d190eae/155_207_915_549/master/915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a997814468fdf52d181d9e2607a44d","title":"living colour the intricacy and beauty of budgies in pictures","story":"Leila Jeffreys started photographing birds in 2008.

But can it lead to lasting change?Chidera Eggerue, AKA The Slumflower, is a social media star, south-east London homegirl and feminist. She first came to prominence in 2017 when she created the hashtag #SaggyBoobsMatter on Twitter in order to promote the body-positive message that women’s breasts and bodies are fine just as they are. It’s an important idea and antithetical to a beauty industry that berates us for our imperfections. A year later Eggerue published a self-help motivational book, What a Time to Be Alone: The Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, which entered the Sunday Times bestseller list the week it was published in 2018, when she was 23. In her very pink, zanily illustrated book, Eggerue, a self-styled “guru, confidante and best friend” to her readers, offers advice on self-worth and self-acceptance. An earlier booklet called Little Black Book: A Toolkit for Working Women, by Otegha Uwagba, became a bestseller in 2016, paving the way for Eggerue. This, in turn, was probably influenced by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s 2014 essay We Should All Be Feminists.These are unprecedented times for black female writers, in no small part due to the internet. It has reconfigured how we present ourselves to the world at large, as well as bringing previously marginalised social groups and writing to the fore in ways hitherto unimaginable. As a society we are beginning to recognise and take seriously the ills and pitfalls of social media, but it is still the most exciting channel of mass communication since history began. And these times really are extraordinary. The ripple effects of 2013’s #BlackLivesMatter moment, and the movement that followed, saw renewed interest in writings about race in the US, which spilled over into the UK. We are used to the spotlight on racism being beamed across the Atlantic while little attention is paid to the perniciousness of systemic racism in Britain, about which there is much denial. Yet when #BlackLivesMatter gained momentum, it precipitated an unprecedented interest in non-fiction books by black writers. In 2016, David Olusoga published Black and British: A Forgotten History, which accompanied an acclaimed television series and reached beyond the usual niche market for such books. Reni Eddo-Lodge’s bestselling Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race (which began as a blog post which went viral) was published in 2017. However, while Eddo-Lodge acknowledges African American feminists of yore, she is silent on our own trailblazers. In 1985, The Heart of the Race: Black Women’s Lives in Britain, edited by Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe, recently reissued, was one of the first non-fiction books that investigated the subject. Heidi Safia Mirza later published Young, Female and Black (1992) and Black British Feminism (1997). Much of this history has been lost: it is rarely taught at universities, nor does it appear in the timelines of what is effectively a whitewashed British feminist history.But all of these recent commercially and critically successful non-fiction books have sent the publishing industry into an unprecedented buying frenzy. Last year, Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible, by Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené, hit the shelves, a book that celebrated the achievements of black British women while offering advice on how to get ahead. This summer, Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi’s Taking Up Space: The Black Girl’s Manifesto for Change was published. It examined the experience of black students in predominantly white higher-education institutions, and also started off as a blog post written when the two women were graduating from Cambridge University in 2018. Television presenter and academic Emma Dabiri is the author of Don’t Touch My Hair (2019), a treatise on black hair and its political, cultural, historical, philosophical and personal resonances. Also published this year was Safe: Black British Men Reclaiming Space, edited by Derek Owusu, co-host of the popular black-focused literature podcast, Mostly Lit. In Black, Listed, Jeffrey Boakye offered a witty and hard-hitting take on black British culture with a quirky dictionary of terms, while No Win Race by Derek Bardowell examined sport and race, family and legacy, ning three decades from the Brixton riots of 1981 to the EU referendum.The field had been so arid up to this point that each of these works feels urgent, essential. Perhaps none is more transgressive than The Grassling, by Elizabeth-Jane Burnett, also a poet, whose 2019 “geological memoir” explores the Devon countryside where she was raised. Burnett’s deeply poetic communion with nature reminds me of Ingrid Pollard’s 1988 Pastoral Interlude series of photographs, which captured, radically, and in a way that was ahead of its time, solitary black figures in the English countryside. Similarly, the play Black Men Walking, written by Testament, featured three northern black men who go on walking trips in the wilds of the Peak District – and talk. Seeing black British people, especially men, extracted from their usual depiction in an urban environment makes you realise how limiting that portrayal has been, how black life has become synonymous with the metropolis. Black Men Walking was a refreshing, progressive look at male friendship in a pastoral setting, while Burnett’s memoir connects us at a primal, immersive level to the topography of a country that is as much ours as anyone else’s.Also off the beaten track is Afropean: Notes from Black Europe (2019) by Johny Pitts, whose travels and encounters with black communities offer a counter-narrative to a continent associated with whiteness. Comparisons will too easily be made with Caryl Phillips’s 1987 pan-European travelogue, The European Tribe. But whereas Phillips’s book is a moving account of the experiences of a black man observing an overwhelming European whiteness more than 30 years ago, Pitts shows us today’s black communities on the continent, and reframes our understanding of it. The books are companion pieces, as well as lessons in history, travel and identity. I ventured on to this terrain in my 2005 novel-with-verse Soul Tourists, creating a fictional black couple who travel across Europe by car to the Middle East in the late 1980s, a journey I myself had undertaken. But books about Europe from a black British perspective, fiction or non-fiction, are hard to find.Writing is a solitary rather than a communal process, and not all writers are community spirited, but the new, mostly female, young activist writer communities use social media to market their projects. These are twentysomethings who employ the term “womxn”, with its inclusive emphasis on women of colour, queer and trans people. These womxn are not waiting for the establishment to fund or publish them they are getting on with it themselves by setting the terms of their intellectual and creative endeavours.I include here the influential gal-dem and Black Ballad magazines, the organisers of the Black Girl festival, Octavia poets’ collective and the Heaux Noire womxn of colour poetry events. Their entrepreneurship and self-determination remind me of the 1980s, when I was their age. Back then, I co-founded Theatre of Black Women, Britain’s first such company, with Patricia Hilaire and Paulette Randall. Out of this community emerged other theatre companies, dance troupes, music groups, publishers, arts collectives. We remade and imagined the complexities of our lives through an art we could call our own. We were a sisterhood, sometimes dysfunctional, not always in agreement, but there was a network of support and collaboration, much as I see with the young womxn of today.In the early 80s, those of us who wanted to write had to look across the Atlantic for inspiration. While there was a literary lineage of black writers in Britain going back to the 1950s and earlier, they were predominantly male and first-generation. In 80s Britain, the Women’s Press imported the successful books of Alice Walker from the US, but with a couple of exceptions, such as the two novels of Joan Riley, was not interested in black British women’s writing. And while Virago championed Maya Angelou, her homegrown counterparts were mostly absent from their lists.I remember disappearing between the pages of Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology (1999), edited by Barbara Smith, during one long weekend and discovering African American female writers who had the confidence and experience to express their realities through poetry and essays. The fragmentary prose-poetry books of the Jamaican-American author, Michelle Cliff, such as Claiming an Identity They Taught Me to Despise (1980), inspired me to be adventurous with my own writing. In her essay “Caliban’s Daughter” (1991), Cliff wrote that her aim was “to reject speechlessness, a process which has taken years, and to invent my own peculiar speech with which to describe my own peculiar self, to draw together everything I am and have been”.Similarly, Audre Lorde wrote in Sister Outsider (1984): “What are the words you do not yet have? What do you need to say? What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will sicken of them and die of them, still in silence.” She inspired my generation of feminists, much as she now inspires the latest generation, with new editions of her works. I met her when she visited London in the early 80s. She wanted to spend time with young black feminists. At an event at the Drill Hall theatre, with an audience of mostly white women, she demanded that the black women without tickets in the lobby be let in, or she wouldn’t take to the stage.And how enriching and motivating it was to read interviews with so many great writers in Black Women Writers at Work (1984) edited by Claudia Tate. These African American women spoke of their process and practice long before you could trawl through online interviews and find authors doing the same. I am indebted to the female writers who went before me, whose pamphlets and books shaped me in my formative years and have travelled with me to my many homes over the decades works that are stained with tobacco smoke, coffee and red wine from the days when I indulged in all three, and, while I have dispensed with thousands of books in my time, these and others from that era I treasure – they still reside on my bookshelves, grouped together to remind me that they were the making of me.We British female writers were emboldened and encouraged by their literature as we began to produce our own. Anthologies were a good way to start to showcase our burgeoning talents and to give us the confidence that comes with publication. There were several anthologies, such as Black Women Talk Poetry (1987), which featured 20 poets, including Jackie Kay, Dorothea Smartt and Adjoa Andoh, published by the newly formed Black Women Talk Poetry Collective of Da Choong, Olivette Cole-Wilson, Gabriela Pearse and myself and Watchers and Seekers (1987), a mixture of poetry and fiction, edited by Rhonda Cobham and Merle Collins.In creating an alternative space for our politicised creativity, we were challenging the status quo. We were too often excluded from white feminist endeavours, just as we were excluded or marginalised from much of the contemporaneous black male arts production. Many of us were queer, either transiently, as it turned out, or for life. This meant that we were more likely to organise as women together, and less reliant on male opinion and approval. Like today’s young arts activists, we were doing it for ourselves rather than hoping to be cherry-picked by this country’s white cultural producers.We never imagined that we would be taken as seriously as we are at this moment. I was thrilled to win the Booker prize earlier this week, just as I was overjoyed when Lubaina Himid won the Turner prize in 2017 for her exciting, innovative and spectacular work, four decades after she began her career as an artist. Similarly, Adjoa Andoh recently co-directed and starred in the first all-women-of-colour Shakespeare production on a major stage in Britain, Richard II at the Globe.One thing I have learned is that the future won’t look after itself. We cannot take any developments for granted. If those of us who are considered marginal stop campaigning, we experience social regression. I wonder what will happen if the support systems, networks and development programmes for people of colour cease to exist. The plethora of books currently being published is astonishing, but we must be wary because today’s boom is not the result of a steady, incremental transition. It has exploded out of a void.Where are its foundations? I have written in the past about fads in the literary world for writers of colour, especially the period in the mid-to-late 90s when there were more young black men and women publishing fiction than ever before, with a tendency towards coming-of-age narratives. By the noughties most of these writers had disappeared. What happens when the big advances do not deliver on their promise? What happens when second-book syndrome kicks in? What about those who have become authors almost by accident, via blogs leading to instant book deals? We want the field of writing to be wide and abundant, ning the very young through to the very old. We want our writers to have long careers spent producing work that matures as they do. Yet the emphasis in publishing and the media focuses on the new and the young, although new and young isn’t synonymous with fresh and original. Some of these writers become shooting stars, and when their moment has passed we wonder what happened to them. History tells us that books can too easily disappear from literary and cultural memory, until such time as they are rediscovered, if at all. Alice Walker resurrected the once-celebrated Zora Neale Hurston in 1975, 15 years after her death. Hurston’s books had been out of print for decades. Obscurity has been the fate of too many black female writers.What is the role of books in our brave new world where knee-jerk reactions predominate, moral outrage is the prevailing orthodoxy and ideas must be compressed to sound bites? Chidera Eggerue, with a hefty 244,000-plus Instagram followers and 79,000-plus on Twitter, sagely advises: “Instagram might shut down one day and suddenly nobody will care about your 80,000 followers. Relevance in the offline world is key.” Conversely, the older writers, artists and activists who eschew social media are missing out on bringing their wisdom, experience and perspective to these debates. It’s an exciting political, intellectual and creative space, and we need to be a part of it – and if not, we must ask ourselves if we are relinquishing our responsibility towards the future.Eggerue, and other arts activists of her generation, are benefiting from the desire of the multinationals to be aligned with woke young people and to exploit their marketability. The revolution, or rather what we might think of as this countercultural moment where those previously without a platform are having their say, has already been commodified. Those of us who are alert to the capriciousness of this should trumpet a note of caution to those who are swept up in the glamour of the moment. We need to ask ourselves how best we can effect change for our constituencies that is sustainable rather than fashionable. My answer is that the spirit of entrepreneurship, community and arts activism will sustain us long after it’s no longer woke to be “woke”.• Brave New Words: The Power of Writing Now, edited by Susheila Nasta, is published by Myriad, to celebrate 35 years of Wasafiri magazine.

All stores remain open for the time being and no redundancies have been made.Tony Wright, a joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory who was appointed on Friday afternoon, said: “Bonmarché has been a staple on the UK high street for nearly three decades, but the persistent challenges facing retail have taken their toll and led to the administration.” He said he hoped to find a buyer for the business.Helen Connolly, the chief executive of Bonmarché, said: “The high street is going through a period of historic difficulty and we have been unable to weather the economic headwinds impacting the whole of the retail sector.”Bonmarché, founded in 1982, is the latest in a string of high street chains to get into difficulties as shoppers rein in spending amid economic uncertainty while staff costs and business rates have risen. Profits have also come under pressure as the value of the pound has fallen against the dollar, increasing the cost of buying goods overseas.Karen Millen, Coast, House of Fraser and Debenhams have all fallen into administration in the past 18 months while New Look and Marks \u0026amp Spencer have been closing stores.Bonmarché, which previously went into administration with sister chain Peacocks in 2012, issued a string of profits warnings in the past year, saying it expected to make a loss of up to £6m this year.The collapse comes after Bonmarché was taken private by the Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day’s Dubai-based acquisition vehicle Spectre in August.The value of Day’s £5m-plus investment in Bonmarché will be wiped out in the administration and it is not clear if Day, who also owns Jaeger, Austin Reed and Peacocks, will try and maintain control of the business.Bonmarché’s problems emerged on the same day that Watt Brothers, the Scottish department store chain, also called in administrators with 220 immediate redundancies and nearly 90 further jobs on the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from small business owners about how they are preparing ahead of BrexitWith the cut-off date to secure a Brexit deal looming, the likely outcome of negotiations this week is still uncertain.

Always ahead of the curve, David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon. Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night, Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal. As the former prime minister put it: “The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people’s hands where mere mortals fail.”That’s it, mate. Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more? We should just take it from one who knows: greasing a pig makes it go better. Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years, it feels right that Cameron chose to finally “go there” on the porcine front in Harrogate, a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility.I would imagine his next tour stop will be in Royal Leamington Spa, where he will expand on the point with a demonstration comparing different means of lubricant. Local boars who’ve always wanted to put their daughter on the stage are invited to get in touch with his promoter.As for which atrocious timeline we are about to be flung into tomorrow, who can say? A lot of journalists would certainly like to say. Everything has improved, hasn’t it, since journalists decided their job is predicting what might happen in the future as opposed to reporting on what they do currently know, or scrutinising what they can currently see.Thus the 36 hours or so between Johnson announcing his deal in Brussels and the special sitting of parliament to vote on it feel like they have been mostly spent watching or reading hacks and pundits debating the complex question, “Will the agreement pass?” I don’t know, guys! I guess you could concentrate on what’s in it – or are you as committed to a no-spoilers Brexit as the government is?Lavishing hours of airtime and miles of column inches on speculating precisely how close it all is feels a bit like being given advance notice of a shitstorm, and frittering your day away taking spread bets on the possible wind speed. Six votes? Three votes? Would someone like to come on air and say they reckon there’s maybe just a couple of votes in it? What if it was a tie?Either way, the conclusion, which may of course be debunked tomorrow, is that it will be Very Close. Then, when it is, lots of people will be able to sweep online to declare that they “CALLED IT”. You can print out those tweets and burn them for warmth in the years when we’re discovering the true implications of the Very Close Vote on whatever it was a vote on.The only people who seem to have spent less time thinking about the detail are the likes of Andrew Bridgen. “It looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit,” he explained to Channel 4 News. “That’s Brexit for me.” Despite being even more cruelly miscast as a “Spartan” than cinema’s Gerard Butler once was, the likes of Mark Francois and Andrew Bridgen have succeeded in getting apparently serious commentators to use their self-styled nickname “the Spartans” without deploying airquotes so thrustingly sarcastic that they could be harnessed for wind power.Meanwhile, Michael Gove could be found lurching unsteadily towards the TV camera to bat away Andrew Neil’s inquiry about the possibility of a second referendum amendment. “That ain’t gonna happen,” drawled the bespectacled Clint Eastwood of Surrey Heath. “Ain’t gonna – ain’t gonna be no second referendum.” In retrospect, that may be the moment this once self-respecting nation had to officially admit it was over.We have created an environment so intensely deregulated that Michael Gove is emboldened enough to imagine he’s some kind of gunslinger. The system has already failed. We passed checks and balances three galaxies ago. Our executive defences have been breached by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man grown in a petri dish to provide Monty Burns with someone who could lose to him at arm wrestling.Given the problems Theresa May had, there was some sense of surprise that Johnson should have pulled off a deal acceptable to the more deranged elements of his party. But history is likely to judge that it’s easier than it looks when you’re a man whose sole ideological red line is frictionless abortions. Having given a speech in November 2018 insisting that “no British Conservative government could or should sign up” to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea, Johnson’s British Conservative government was just shy of three months old when it cheerily signed up to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea. That was a great outcome, explained foreign secretary and famous geography dunce Dominic Raab, who said it was a “cracking deal” for Northern Ireland on the basis that they’d keep “frictionless access to the single market”. There it is: the dream. Only a few more days of having to remember which lie you told.Speaking of Northern Ireland, the week has offered the chance to watch the Democratic Unionist party discover in real time who the sucker at the table was. It would take a heart of stone not to enjoy the disappointment of DUP hive queen Arlene Foster, who has carried herself throughout the Brexit process like the kind of maternal screen villain who tries to scupper their child’s every romantic attachment for not being good enough.The DUP have so enjoyed being at the centre of the soap opera since the 2017 election, and acting like as, that they didn’t realise until they saw this week’s script that the producers couldn’t be doing with them any more and were killing them off. It’s a lot like what happened with Martine McCutcheon on EastEnders. She went off and showed them by having a 15-minute pop career Arlene is not thought to have any musical ambitions, but will now always be a hero to those dreaming of a united Ireland.As for the prime minister, he seems to be enjoying himself, as much as is possible for a sort of middle-aged Kylo Ren who’s making all the correct self-care decisions. In Westminster, many judge that, whatever happens tomorrow, Boris Johnson is in a win-win situation, with the sole losing entity being the entire United Kingdom. As David Cameron continues to promote his bestselling book, and the rabid deregulators continue to promote Boris Johnson, it does feel as if the nation might end up the true sucker in all this. Then again, for all the mirth it produced, there was always a rather leaden sense of dramatic irony clouding the original Cameronpig tale. People like David Cameron end up playing David Cameron. The rest of the public is in danger of being the pig."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/663bbb3b1439b359bdef494f31bedb59ba88afbc/0_0_4174_2503/master/4174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac26d2aaf7d1a711c6e9c1e14ca96c57","title":"dup humiliated westminster","story":"Boris Johnson has abandoned the party and with the ‘cash for ash’ report imminent, its influence will be still further diminishedThree days ago, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) seemed to hold the fate of Europe in its hands. Ever since, it has been forced to stand gloomily in the wings watching while Boris Johnson struts in the limelight, backslapping those “blackmailing burghers of Brussels”, as Sammy Wilson MP, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman called the EU leaders last year. Whatever happens in the vote for the Brexit deal in parliament this weekend, the special relationship with the Tories that enabled the DUP to act like old-style one party rule had returned to Northern Ireland is over.Just last month Johnson shambled into a DUP gathering at the Conservative party conference in Manchester to joyous shouts of “Boris! Boris! Boris!” In a speech almost drowned out by stomping and cheering, he declared that as he looked out at the “sea of eager happy faces tonight supporting our precious union I know it is in good shape and that we unionists are in good heart”. DUP leader Arlene Foster almost curtsied. A year ago Johnson was the belle of the ball at the DUP conference in Belfast. By rejecting Theresa May’s deal, they had saved the UK and saved Northern Ireland from being turned into a “semi-colony of the EU” he declared. He even promised them the bridge to Scotland for which they have been clamouring. Everyone else saw the bridge was a postmodern joke. Johnson could hardly stop laughing.Well, more fool the DUP. Sympathy for its plight now will be scant. The party shafted the pro-remain majority of voters in Northern Ireland when it sold its 10 parliamentary votes to the Tories in exchange for sole access to power and influence in Westminster. It was also a move that showed mutual contempt for the Good Friday agreement, which requires the British to exercise “rigorous impartiality” in dealings with Northern Ireland and its parties.May learned the hard way that the DUP’s loyalty is only to itself. How could the DUP then have failed to see that the same is true of the Little Englanders? Ian Paisley Jr, in between luxury, all-expenses-paid holidays in exotic countries with dodgy human rights records, hosted various Tory grandees at fundraisers in his constituency. Did the DUP really think it could have and hold Lord Snooty just for the price of a dinner in a Ballymena hotel?It may well have done. When talks fail, money has been found to talk with the DUP: when it was wrongly reported on Wednesday that the party was onboard for Johnson’s deal, there was widespread cynical speculation about how many millions the prime minister had promised them. The party that used to be most strongly associated with puritanical biblical rectitude is now notorious for its apparent devotion to Mammon.On Thursday, the party’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds accused Johnson of being too hasty in agreeing a deal. (The three painful years of Brexit negotiations represent not even the blink of an eye in the timescale of the biblically minded.) The fact of the matter was, Dodds said: “If he held his nerve and held out he would, of course, have got better concessions.”Well, here is a parable: a few years ago, a DUP minister in Stormont was told by his private secretary that a poultry company based in Northern Ireland wished to give him a free turkey for Christmas. The minister was in the middle of making decisions that would have a bearing on the future profits of the company – he was told that the turkey could be small, medium or large. The minister asked his private secretary to phone the company and ask them if they had something bigger.That story is included in a remarkable book just published in Ireland. If the black clouds of the past week had just a sliver of a silver lining for the DUP it is that the sudden escalation of Brexit negotiations took some attention away from author Sam McBride’s revelations about the DUP’s true attitude to the UK. The book, Burned, is about the renewable heating incentive (RHI) scandal in Northern Ireland. It reveals that the party was, it seems, quite happy to keep the so-called “cash for ash” incentive going in its beloved province for as long as it could milk the British treasury to pay for it. Panic only set in when it emerged that Stormont had to pay for the overspend. McBride compared the RHI legislation introduced in the UK in 2011 with the legislation brought into Northern Ireland the following year by Foster, then minister for enterprise, trade and investment. They were almost identical – except that 107 words had been removed from the Northern Ireland version: the ones that dealt with cost controls.McBride is a journalist of integrity, and the political editor of the News Letter, a pro-union paper. He speaks of “reckless profligacy – or worse”. Sinn Féin was a willing partner in this “economic nationalism”, but for Irish republicans the British were for centuries the imperial enemy and old habits die hard. Senior DUP figures and their relations were among those piling into a scheme that offered business and non-domestic users a refund from the treasury of £1.60 for every £1 of fuel used, in a bid to get them to switch to renewable energy sources. The scheme was to be “grandfathered” for 20 years. A Brazil-based multinational poultry company was set ultimately to reap the highest benefits. After years of costly delay, and damage to the environment, the scheme was shut down – eventually the Northern Irish assembly collapsed in the wake of the scandal, among other isive issues. In writing his book, McBride sought and was refused interviews with Foster and other key DUP figures.Foster insisted to Sir Patrick Coghlin’s inquiry into the scandal that she did not recognise there was a “perverse incentive” to burn fuel at the heart of the scheme, despite having been told of it by a whistleblower. Plenty did spot it. Boilers blazed in empty churches with open windows. Poultry catchers complained they were sweating so much they had to change their clothes during shifts. As comedian Tim McGarry put it, there were farmers in Northern Ireland putting on oven gloves to open the door of their sheds.The report of the RHI inquiry is imminent, and will not endear the DUP to the British taxpayer. Fresh from its humiliation over the Brexit deal, on Monday the party will make a last-ditch – and bound to fail – bid to stop a Westminster bill from legalising abortion and same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. With perhaps unfortunate timing, it is also about to face its party conference. The DUP is going to have to break it to the faithful that there will be no bridge to Scotland.• Susan McKay is an Irish writer and journalist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93efaa13dc0103a79ffc88f42bda8dd149b802aa/97_574_3268_1961/master/3268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f18705999758609cc92d0c4a6de7ca2a","title":"second referendum scottish independence brexit scots","story":"Brexit is just one reason Scots are increasingly drawn to the idea of living in a small, liberal, European nation stateThe political landscape has changed because Holyrood and Westminster have erged so strongly on policy. There is real fury in Scotland that the Home Office is still at large, stymieing the desire to secure the future of EU citizens, its existence obstructing a potentially liberal immigration policy.There have been no attempts to marketise the health service in the country, unlike elsewhere in the UK, and a raft of social measures have passed that ensure no tuition fees, free personal care, and a childcare policy that gives every new child a baby box starter pack and, from next year, a £10 a week allowance.It’s not a utopia. It’s not problem- or failure-free. But people increasingly know they want no part of a world in which a morally bankrupt Boris Johnson can become prime minister and Jacob Rees-Mogg leader of the House. They look in horror at the rise of Tommy Robinson’s English Defence League and of both Islamophobia and antisemitism.Increasing numbers like the idea of living in a small, liberal, European nation state. That uptick in support in a raft of polls was not the only factor that produced two pledges from Sturgeon that on the surface leave her with little wriggle room among her more fervent pro-independence supporters. She has watched – although pointedly not participated in – pro-independence marches all over Scotland, with the most recent wave culminating in 200,000 turning up on her Edinburgh doorstep on a damp and dreich October afternoon.The fact that she has now pledged to ask for the powers to hold another referendum to be transferred to the Holyrood parliament by the end of this year – the section 30 order signed by both David Cameron and Alex Salmond in 2012 – and, crucially, promised her troops a new referendum in 2020, means that she placed herself on a collision course with the prime minister, and self-declared minister for the union.For months she has been under pressure to be bolder. Her legendary caution has been founded on one central belief: that unless a referendum is run on the legally binding basis a section 30 order provides, what she calls “the gold standard”, she would be unable to persuade Brussels and the wider world of its legitimacy.Backstage, however, much is going on to pave the way for a second vote. The referendums bill (Scotland) is nearing the end of its parliamentary journey. This says that when the power to hold one is devolved, it can proceed very quickly. It also waives the usual lengthy procedure to agree a question where one has been asked before. The very large elephant in this room is what happens when Boris Johnson – or any other premier – simply says no. In her speech, Sturgeon told other parties “not to even pick up the phone” if they didn’t accede to her demand.Mike Russell, the minister responsible for constitutional matters including Brexit, hinted that his government might take the matter to the courts. Yet there is no guarantee this would work. A legal challenge to post-Brexit powers – even previously devolved ones – being repatriated to Westminster rather than Holyrood was lost in 2017.It is a trope much used by commentators that Brexit has fuelled the desire for self-determination in Scotland. Moreover, that if there were to be a new vote for remain, the SNP’s fox would be shot. This is to misunderstand profoundly the current mood in Scotland.Brexit is clearly a factor in a remain-voting country. It’s true, too, that there is enduring frustration at watching the DUP trotting in and out of Downing Street despite having 10 seats at Westminster, less than a third of the Nationalists’ 35-seat presence. Unlike the SNP, the DUP is also totally at odds with its own electorate. This frustration has been exacerbated by the Brexit ministers from Scotland and Wales being sidelined throughout the negotiations with Brussels, and the joint ministerial council reduced to little more than window dressing.The Institute for Government has produced a report that says it would be unsustainable to deny a second independence referendum if Scots vote for parties supporting one. It says: “If the union is to survive, it must be because a majority of people in all four parts of the UK are persuaded that its survival is for the best, not because Westminster wields the power… to hold the nations… together against their will.”Sturgeon insists the question is not what Scotland should do if Westminster says no to a referendum. The question, she says, is what gives anyone the right to refuse Scots the choice? These days it’s a question with resonance well beyond her party’s faithful.• Ruth Wishart is a Scottish columnist and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe08ff31f6620ca528e6e26f10b217cccc095fc/0_55_5099_3059/master/5099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f71e3dc9c2b6fc41bfb55976082636","title":"we as mps need to come together to get brexit done and move on","story":"Pride needs to be swallowed and colleagues of all stripes need to vote for a deal on SaturdayLast month, we came together with colleagues across the house to find a middle ground between the extremes of no deal and a second referendum. Our mission was to give a voice to the silent majority – both in parliament and across the country – a voice to those who respect the result of the referendum, and who want us to leave with a deal and move on.When our constituents tell us they are fed up of politics, and tired of Brexit, we can understand where they are coming from. They tell us we are focused on the wrong things, our priorities are all wrong, and that the issues they care about have been cast aside by the Brexit distraction.Switching on the news, it’s easy to think that MPs spend all their time fighting and disagreeing with each other. But quietly, in the background, many of us have clung to the things that unite us – the things that will matter long after Brexit has been resolved.That’s why we have decided to write together the day before this historic sitting – not just as a proof that MPs of different stripes can work together, but to implore our colleagues to use this unique chance to help us move on, and get back to helping our constituents.A no-deal Brexit will risk their prosperity, and a second referendum will only deepen the schism of the past three years.

Jargon, vague promises, dire warnings, contradictory predictions, a few catchphrases – an alternately gripping and boring conversation that has been going on for years, only occasionally accompanied by actual changes to everyday life. It’s a conversation that remainers have rarely controlled, let alone dominated. If they are, finally, about to lose the Brexit battle, this may be why.For all their ingenuity and energy since the referendum, they haven’t done enough to undermine the messages that leavers have used to sell their project. Nor have remainers produced equally effective propaganda of their own. Much of the empirical case for Brexit may have unravelled over the past three years, but remainers still haven’t shifted public opinion decisively enough.After the referendum result was announced, leave figures quickly began talking about “the biggest democratic exercise” and “largest mandate” in British history. The first claim was incorrect: more people voted in the 1992 general election, when the UK population was more than a 10th smaller. And the second claim was at least debatable: the leavers’ victory margin was much narrower than those in the UK’s two previous national referendums. Yet remainers did little to stop both claims solidifying into orthodoxies, so widely held that to question them feels a bit nit-picking, nerdy, counterintuitive. The leavers’ preferred frame has been placed around the referendum result.The same has happened with who voted for Brexit. Again and again, they have been characterised as “the left behind”: poor, neglected, Labour-inclined voters from the north of England. The reality that Brexit is essentially a rightwing project – to deregulate the British economy for the benefit of more hard-nosed, non-EU capitalism – has been largely obscured. Since 2016, a few dissenting academics, most prominently the Oxford University geographer Danny Dorling, have produced strong evidence that more Brexit voters were, in fact, prosperous Conservatives from southern England. But these interventions have hardly dented the conventional wisdom. From BBC vox pops to tabloid editorials to Labour shadow cabinet meetings, “left-behind” leavers still loom disproportionately large. Remainers have been unable to identify and promote a similarly marketable political cohort of their own.Another pro-Brexit message that has been allowed to spread largely unchecked is that it’s possible to “get Brexit done” quickly and conclusively. In February, the pollster Andrew Cooper wrote in the London Evening Standard that when focus groups were told that an initial Brexit deal “would actually trigger a new and almost certainly much longer and more complex new phase of talks”, there was “horrified silence”. That remainers have failed since 2016 to bring most voters to this realisation – that they have made Brexit seem a malign but largely abstract process – has been a crucial failure.Yet perhaps the inability of remainers to control the Brexit discourse should be no surprise. The formation of the prevailing common sense on political questions is rarely driven by which side has the better ideas. The leavers have had most of the press on their side, implacably anti-European for decades. And the BBC has been strikingly reluctant to pick apart dubious pro-Brexit claims, for example about the supposedly overwhelming leave mandate – for fear, it seems, of being accused of remainer bias. More helpful still, leave has benefited from the tendency of most journalists, very obvious in recent days – see the breathless excitement about Johnson’s “great new deal” – to prefer breakthroughs to stalemates. Rather than assuming that journalists outside the Tory press would always act as remain’s allies – as fact-checkers against the leavers’ half-truths and lies – remainers should have realised that a Brexit deal, and whatever uncharted world comes after, is simply a better story for the media than Britain staying in the EU.Leavers have had much of Whitehall on their side, too. The government’s “Get Ready for Brexit” campaign, launched last month, was officially described as Britain’s “largest ever government public information campaign”. It may be clunky, but together with the equally derided Department for Exiting the European Union, established in 2016, the publicity campaign has helped to keep Brexit feeling inevitable, even at times when the government’s flailings at Westminster have suggested otherwise.Remain has lacked such potent allies. Despite the huge economic risks of Brexit, business organisations have not opposed it with much intensity. Currently, the website of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) meekly hopes for “a good Brexit deal” that “delivers frictionless trade” – as if the latter was a realistic ambition rather than a fantasy, shared by many leavers, for a country intending to exit the world’s richest free trade zone. This month, the CBI has reserved its energies for a fierce but factually inaccurate attack on Labour’s nationalisation plans instead. The episode suggests the CBI might be more assertive if Brexit were being pursued by a Labour government.Given all these biases, perhaps even a more proactive remain propaganda campaign would have been doomed from the start. Yet the failure to mount one, at least so far, does reveal something important about the remain movement. It has not been focused enough, in a sense, not political enough. At times, in fact, it has tried to make a virtue of not being political.It’s telling that the only two remain phrases to really cut through have been “bollocks to Brexit” (morale-boosting defiance for the already converted) and “people’s vote” (a call for a second referendum that is coy about how people should actually vote). Neither has the agenda-setting quality of the leavers’ best messages.In the long run, the remainers’ rhetorical failures may matter less than they have since 2016. If Johnson’s deal passes, and both the leavers’ euphoria and the wider public’s sense of relief dissipate, the Brexit crisis will still be there – but as a more concrete matter, less about rhetoric and more about economic and diplomatic realities. Remainers may finally be able to say the words that some of them have been itching to use for years: “We told you so.” It’s emblematic of the whole Brexit tragedy that the remainers’ best line can only be used when it’s too late.• Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f03f83d52f4ce1a95a00eb2b2d41debdcf9efb72/0_18_1216_730/master/1216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f8b116adb1844ec74cb584f1970e6b","title":"10 unmissable experiences in nova scotia","story":"Whether it’s visiting wine country by doubledecker bus, rafting on a tidal bore or tucking into a lobster feast, there are memories to be made in Nova ScotiaNova Scotia is the kind of place where strangers stop to talk and smiles come easy. It’s also where this famous east-coast hospitality, fresh seafood, good wine and pristine beaches all come together to create memorable summer holidays. Just a six-hour flight from the UK, there’s no shortage of things to do, from exploring historic fishing villages to world-class surfing. Here are our top 10 recommendations.Line up a lobsterWhether it’s fish and chips from a food truck or fresh oysters from a trendy downtown restaurant, there is no shortage of seafood here. Although Nova Scotia is renowned for its lobster, other seafood options are extensive and menus are constantly evolving, but for a traditional lobster feast, you can take your pick from a lineup of restaurants along the Halifax waterfront. The most famous local lobster experience, however, can be found at the Shore Club, located by the shore 30 minutes outside of the city in Hubbards. The club has been around for more than 80 years and is popular with locals, while the restaurant serves a daily lobster dinner throughout the summer.Take in colourful LunenburgThe charming seaside town, located an hour south of Halifax, on the South Shore, is known for its brightly painted wooden houses and buildings. The colourful facades are meant to reflect how the town would have looked during Victorian times, when houses served as beacons for the ships coming in to port. It’s the perfect town to stroll in, stopping for a fresh seafood lunch by the water and admiring the secret coves and fishing boats. It’s also home to the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic, as well as the Ironworks Distillery, where visitors can enjoy both local spirits and a lesson in Lunenburg’s history of rum running.Have a pre-breakfast surfThe secret is out: some of the best waves this side of the Atlantic are waiting for those intrepid enough to withstand the cool waters. Think misty mornings, wetsuits and world-class waves, all set against the bucolic backdrop of friendly, rural communities. Infamous east-coast storms and hurricanes can result in some intense waves, but it’s still a good spot to learn, with the help of expert teachers at East Coast Surf School. Bonus: the waves are so close to the city you can hit the beach for an early-morning surf and be back in time for breakfast.Sea kayaking in Cape LaHaveKayak through a network of more than 20 islands, with incredible local guides at Cape LaHave Adventures. Paddlers can learn about the flora, fauna and folklore of the region and see untouched beaches and coastal wildlife, including seals. Choose from a two-hour lesson to a three-day glamping adventure that includes campfires, craft cocktails and fresh oysters for dinner.The Rum Runners TrailDuring Prohibition, many Nova Scotian fishermen opted for a lucrative career change: rum running from Canada to the eastern seaboard of the US. The former train route that transported much of the booze from the hidden inlets to the main ports, almost 100 years ago, has now been converted into a 74-mile multi-use trail that runs between Halifax and Lunenburg. The trail is the ideal way for outdoor enthusiasts to explore the coastal communities, stopping at local cafes, bars, beaches and provincial parks along the way.Alight at Peggy’s Cove Nova Scotia is home to more than 150 lighthouses, but the one at Peggy’s Cove is definitely the most recognised. Just a 40-minute drive outside Halifax, the cove is covered in sprawling granite boulders that stretch out into the crashing waves of the Atlantic, creating a dramatic backdrop for landscape photos and windswept selfies. Wooden fishing shacks and lobster traps line the inlet that both local fishermen and an inspired community of artists all call home.Fossil hunt at Bay of FundyThe Bay of Fundy is a unique, visually arresting coastal environment. Every day the tide rises as high as 16 metres (53 feet) and during the following six hours recedes back down, leaving behind geological gems on the ocean floor. At low tide, it’s possible to walk along the mudflats, hunt for fossils and look at marine life in tidal pools. For a more adrenaline-infused way to experience the tides, head out on a tidal-bore rafting adventure. When the incoming tide meets the Shubenacadie River, the waves created by the tidal bore make for a pretty wild rafting ride.On the Halifax waterfrontHalifax boasts almost 4km of boardwalk and the waterfront is jam-packed with museums, farmers’ markets and shops. There are also plenty of options for harbour tours. Alternatively, watch the boats sail in while sipping on a cold pint in a beer garden, or head somewhere a little more upscale, like the Five Fishermen, to feast on fresh seafood and local wines. Catch some live music at Stayner’s Wharf Pub and Grill, or at the iconic Lower Deck, located in one of the beautiful Historic Properties. Across the harbour, the downtown of neighbouring Dartmouth boasts lots of excellent cafes, breweries and restaurants. The ferry takes just 10 minutes to cross and offers excellent views of the city.Explore the coastlineWherever you end up in Nova Scotia, you can count on a beach being close by. The province has more than 8,200 miles of pristine coastline, including the many islands that dot the coast, and there are beaches to suit everyone’s taste. Think white sand and crystal-clear turquoise water, rocky, mist-laden shores with rolling waves or swimming and relaxing at the warm water beaches of Northumberland Shore. If you fancy surfing, Lawrencetown beach is a favourite, with its sand and cobblestone beach and big waves, just half an hour from the city centre. Crystal Crescent, just 40 minutes south of the city, is an expansive crescent-shaped beach, backed by a gorgeous 12-mile coastal hiking trail.Enjoy the east-coast hospitality and explore Halifax with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d27db2ed4dbdc2ca8591745ea053df89e9fce7b/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ac4463d4563e0614ad67ce464dfea122 1400w","title":"we have the best hole in the walls the insider guide to edmonton","story":"Hometown devotee Jen Mallia chats with city ambassador Linda Hoang and photographer extraordinaire Emilie Iggiotti for the inside scoop on Edmonton, Alberta’s buzzing capitalEdmonton boasts an arts scene that won’t quit and a banging array of places to eat and drink, plus opportunities to commune with nature, shop indie boutiques or visit the largest mall on the continent. It’s a welcoming city on the prairies of roughly a million people – a home for artists, tradespeople, academics, government workers, and people from around the world. Edmonton is the place you didn’t know you belonged!Another way to enjoy the mix of the urban and provincial in Edmonton is at one of the farmers’ markets. Many of them are outdoor, and therefore seasonal, but a select few operate year-round indoors. The Downtown Farmers’ Market is an indoor-outdoor hybrid. During the winter months, the market takes over one of downtown’s historic buildings, and in the warmer months it takes to the streets.During the summer months, the outdoor markets shift around the city, and you’ll find local gems around Edmonton’s inner neighbourhoods on both Saturdays and Sundays from June through to Canadian Thanksgiving in mid-October, when vendors up stalls and shift indoors. (Insider tip: don’t miss Moonshine Doughnuts at Old Strathcona Farmers’ Market – vegan and delicious!)Edmonton is nicknamed Festival City for a reason – you won’t get too far without happening upon a celebration. If a person likes something, Edmonton has a festival for it … from ice to cats! One of the most popular is the Edmonton international fringe theatre festival, held in venues centred in the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Every year at the end of August, performers from around the world contribute their work. Attendees can see a show at almost any time of the day or night, then hang out in the beer garden, trading critiques on the performances that range from the ridiculous to the sublime.Trendy Whyte Avenue is the backbone of the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Take time to poke through the shops, restaurants, and bars that line the avenue and surrounding blocks. Don’t miss brunch at Pip, or satisfy your sweet tooth at La Boule or Sugared \u0026amp Spiced. A soft serve ice-cream from Yelo’d is the perfect accompaniment to a sunny day. Venture a bit to the southeast to check out the new Ritchie Market – notably for Transcend Coffee or something stronger from Blind Enthusiasm brewery. Their craft beers pair well with the bites from adjacent Biera.Just like Fringe, Rust Magic is an annual festival that features the work of local and international artists. But Instead of treading the boards, these artists are spray-painting them. Each year since 2016, 15 new murals have been created and bequeathed to the city. Plans are in the works for guided tours of the street art during the festival, and maps are readily available at local businesses for self-guided exploration. Periodically throughout the year, Hoang herself runs Photo Walks featuring Instagrammable Walls of Edmonton, which are a great way to see some city colour and get some superb pics to take home too.Before Alberta developed its oil and gas industry, it was straight-up farming and ranch country. Calling back to the area’s agricultural heritage, high-calibre restaurants are cropping up all over town, with chefs focusing on innovative ways to use locally grown and sourced ingredients. A great way to sample a variety of these restaurants is with a culinary tour from Eat or Alberta Food Tours you can also pedal between nibbles and drinks with Food Bike Tours or the big bikes from Urban Pedal.You won’t go hungry in any area of the city, but a high concentration of foodie favourites are found downtown and in the Ice District. Try the vegan pizzas at Die Pie, Italian to die for at Uccellino, wood-fired creations at Woodwork, or share some plates at Bundok or Baijiu.West of downtown has experienced a hip revival in recent years. In addition to arty new shops, there are tons of places to eat. Start at Wilfred’s in the Brewery District, then swing by the Oliver Exchange Building, full of great places to grab a bite or a drink. Come hungry to enjoy Canadian cuisine at RGE RD on 123rd Street NW. A short walk to the north-east brings you to the fresh and French Café Linnea. If you still have room after that, locals swear by the treats at Duchess Bake Shop and the vegan cookies at Bloom Cookie Co.Before heading off, make sure to toast your time in the city. There are ample opportunities to enjoy a pint or two. To curate the experience, try a brewery tour from Alberta Craft Tours or Urban Pedal. If you are going it on your own, make sure Sea Change, Strathcona Spirits, Town Square, and the newly opened Polar Park are on your list. Make time for an inventive cocktail at the cosy Bar Clementine or chic Partake. For something a little different, try to score tickets on Eventbrite for one of the seasonal Street Car Cask events hosted by the Common. There’s beer and snacks and lots of fun, as the reconditioned streetcar travels across the top of the High Level Bridge connecting downtown and Old Strathcona.Fly London to Edmonton with WestJet to enjoy this growing city.

Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.” Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist, John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399dfc115cc0d5d9d9d140ac885cc05cfca93401/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fcc539d5e386fbff529197dec69b4c","title":"naming and shaming the polluters","story":"Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

Pour the egg into the welland scramble together with a fork – they are mixed sufficiently when you lift the fork and you have a homogeneous, non-clumpy looking liquid that falls smoothly from your fork. Draw a fork round the inside of the flour wall, so a small quantity of flour falls into the egg mixture. Whisk it in, smooshing any lumps, so you gradually create a batter. Repeat until you have a mixture that won’t run all over the board, then cave in the flour walls and mix in the rest of the flour with a bench scraper by scraping the flour inwards and over the batter.Mop up any flour with your dough and give it a quick knead. If it is sticky, add a tablespoon of flour and knead again. Knead the dough for 10 minutes minimum: it should feel soft and pillowy. Think of your hands as waves: the heels of your hands push the dough away from you while your fingers pull it back. Once the dough becomes a log, turn it 90 degrees, fold it in half and continue kneading. You want to work at a brisk pace, as air is the enemy of decent pasta – it will dry it out. If the pasta feels too dry, dampen your hands with water to put moisture back into the dough. Your dough should feel silky and smooth. Put the dough in a lidded bowl, cover it to stop it from drying out, and leave the dough at room temperature for 30 minutes (or in the fridge overnight – but bring back to room temperature before you try rolling).Cup your hands over a rolling pin so your wrists nearly touch the pasta board, and flatten the dough with a pin, turning it a few degrees at a time. When it is the size of a plate, start with your hands at hip width and roll the top third of your dough (furthest away from you) by following the curve of the circle and drawing your hands inwards as you push the pin away from you. Your hands will meet in the middle. Stop the pin before it reaches the very edge. Roll the dough four times, turn the pasta from 12 o’clock to 1 o’clock and repeat, going round the clock. To get rid of the bump of pasta in the middle, flip the outer edge of pasta over the pin, hold the pasta with one hand, and put the other hand on the dough to stop it moving. Give the pin a tug with the pasta hand to create a snug fit around the pin. Roll the dough over the pin towards you. Move your hands wider, stick your elbows out and, pressing down, roll the pasta out two or three times.This will flatten the thicker central zone of your pasta. Finish with the pasta rolled up and turn it 90 degrees, opening it out across the board. Repeat this process until the sfoglia (the pasta sheet) is too large to move comfortably by hand. At this stage, you will need to Roll it up around the pin and turn it, as described above. Allow your pin to roll on its own across the dough to remove any air after you have turned it.To check it’s evenly rolled, roll up a third, hold the edges (it will fall off the pin otherwise) and hold it up to the light. Darker patches mean thicker dough and that you haven’t rolled it uniformly, so you will want to go back over these areas. Leave your pasta sheet to dry on the board for five minutes.Prep 1 hr 15 minCook 5 minMakes 32 cestini (enough for 4, as a starter)For the pasta300g 00 flour or plain (all-purpose) flour3 eggsFor the filling250g ricotta, drained weight70g grated Parmigiano ReggianoZest of 1 unwaxed large lemonMake the egg pasta as described above. Roll it out to about 1mm thick, so you can see the board beneath it. Cut into 7cm squares – Monica has a special roller to do this, but you can use a ruler and a pastry cutter.Combine all the ingredients to make the filling. Dot a teaspoon of the ricotta mixture into the centre of each square. Gather the four points together and firmly press the adjoining edges together to create four seams. Repeat until you have used all your filling.Bring a large pan of salted water to a gentle canter of a simmer and lower the cestini into it with a small sieve or slotted spoon. Cook for three to four minutes.While they are cooking, melt the butter in a small pan. When the cestini are ready, don’t drain them, but scoop them out with a sieve or slotted spoon and plate them up with a couple of spoonfuls of melted butter and a dusting of cinnamon. Allow about eight per person.For the pasta400g 00 flour or plain flour4 eggsFor the dressing4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled3 tbsp chopped fresh mint (preferably nepitella)500g fresh porcini, wild, girolle or chanterelle mushrooms, choppedSaltMake the egg pasta dough as described above. Once it has rested for 30 minutes, roll it out to the thickness of shortcrust pastry – aim for 2-3mm thick. Roll it up around your pin while you make the dressing.Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan. Add the garlic and mint, and fry for a couple of minutes before adding the chopped mushrooms. Keep frying to soften the mushrooms, season with a pinch of salt, and add 100ml water. Let this cook off, then continue frying the mushrooms until they are golden.Remove the garlic. Boil a large saucepan of water, salt it, and return it to the boil. Keeping the pasta rolled around your rolling pin, hold the pin above and near the water (don’t burn yourself in the steam). Pull pieces off and drop them in the water. For those of you who don’t want to brandish your rolling pin, simply tear off pasta stripssquaresodd shapes roughly the size of a credit card and then dump them into the boiling water.Cook for two to three minutes, depending on the thickness of your pasta pieces.Drain and add the pasta to the mushroom mixture. Give everything a good stir, toss together and serve.For the pasta300g farro flour (if you can’t find any, use spelt flour)100g 00 flour or plain flour, plus extra for rolling4 eggsFor the pancetta2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil4 thick rashers pancetta, sliced into matchsticks1 onion, peeled and diced1 red chilli, deseeded (or not if you like it fiery)125ml glass white wine400g tin chopped tomatoes (or fresh if it is the height of summer)Salt25g grated pecorino romano, plus extra to serveMake the egg pasta dough as above, and leave your pasta sheet to dry while you make the sauce. Heat the oil in a saute pan, add the pancetta and fry briskly, until the fat has been released from the meat and it’s starting to colour. Remove the pancetta from the pan, leaving the fat behind, and put it to one side.Add the onion and chilli to the pan and fry over a medium heat for seven minutes, or until the onion is soft. Deglaze the pan with the wine and keep frying while the alcohol evaporates. The steam from the pan should cease to smell winey. Add the tomatoes and pancetta, and give everything a good stir. Season with a pinch of salt. Let it bubble away while you slice your pasta.Smooth your sfoglia (pasta sheet) with a little 00 flour. Roll the pasta up like a carpet and, using a cleaver or straight-bladed knife, slice across as thinly as possible to create fine ribbons. Unroll the ribbons and toss them with your hands to give them a good airing. Keep the ribbons apart to stop them from sticking.Bring a pan of salted water to a spirited boil, and heap your pasta into the water. The tagliolini will cook quickly, in about two minutes.Remove the chilli from the sauce. Scoop the pasta out of the pan with a slotted spoon or sieve and ladle it into the sauce. Add the grated pecorino romano, toss and serve immediately, sprinkling with more cheese if you wish.For the pasta200g 00 or plain flour200g finely ground semolina flour, plus extra for sprinkling4 eggs, plus 1 egg yolkFor the fillingCoarse sea salt1 large pumpkin, peel on, cut into 6 large chunks, seeds removed¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg100g parmigiano reggiano, grated, plus extra to serveSalt and black pepperMake the egg pasta dough as above, and leave your pasta sheet to dry while you make the sauce above and let it rest. Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)gas 3. Weigh out 1kg of pumpkin and keep the rest for another dish. Cover a baking tray with a layer of sea salt, put the pumpkin pieces on the tray and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the flesh is soft. Cool, then remove the peel from the pulp. Mash the pumpkin, then stir in the nutmeg and parmigiano reggiano. Make sure the cheese is thoroughly mixed in and season well. Set aside while you make the pasta.Roll out the dough to 1mm thick – you should be able to see your hand through it. Use a pastry cutter or knife to cut 7cm squares. Put a teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each pasta square. To make a cappellaccio, fold the pasta over the filling to make a triangle. Hold one of the smaller corners between your finger and thumb and bring the opposite corner around your forefinger so the two corners meet and create the hat. Make sure the edges are firmly pressed together. Put each one on a tray covered with a cloth and sprinkle with semolina.Bring a large pan of salted water to a rolling boil. In another large pan, melt the butter over a gentle heat and add the sage leaves, allowing them to crisp up.Once the pan of water has reached a simmer, drop in the cappellacci and cook for about four minutes, before tasting one for doneness. Continue to cook for another minute or so if necessary. Drain the pasta carefully, add it to the butter and sage pan and continue to cook for another minute.To serve, gently scoop the pasta into six bowls, iding the buttery sauce equally between them. Scatter over extra freshly grated parmigiano reggiano and serve.• Recipes from Pasta Grannies: The Secrets of Italy’s Best Home Cooks by Vicky Bennison (Hardie Grant, £20)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b4ca24a8ad97f332e3e09a6b015d7e74409079/0_139_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2b51c2cedeb37527ccc0ca864b487e","title":"womens football have you tried to set up a grassroots team","story":"We want to hear from those who have struggled to set up women’s football teams Women’s football has seen a score of successes in recent months: England’s top league went professional, the World Cup was watched by record-breaking audiences and crowds during the current FA cup are growing.The number of girls and women taking up the sport has also skyrocketed, with 605 new girls youth teams and 260 new adult female clubs registered to play this season.But some women have experienced difficulties in accessing facilities, such as pitches.

We’re lucky we’re at home and we’ve got a derby, so I’m not complaining but I can see when you’re trying to grow momentum it’s difficult.“I remember after the 2015 World Cup and we wanted to capitalise but we didn’t have a home game for nearly eight weeks, so we couldn’t. There are things that still frustrate but I think in terms of league scheduling it’s probably the best we’ve ever seen it, and that’s probably because there’s less international windows as well.” When United entered the Championship last season the new club benefited from the opportunity to play top-tier opposition in the cup. “It was brilliant – we needed it because it meant we could play better teams,” Stoney said. “We’ve got a really difficult group this time: it gives us the opportunity to play Man City three times, Everton three times … Unfortunately some of the other groups are slightlyweighted the other way.

Klopp, however, claims it is insulting to dismiss United as a “nobody” while Danny Mills’ combined XI featuring only Liverpool players, the overwhelming odds on his team to win at Old Trafford and the negativity surrounding Solskjær are designed purely to motivate the struggling hosts. “People are trying to create it as a banana skin,” said Klopp, who has not won at Old Trafford as Liverpool manager.“They are trying to make it as we are THE team and they are nobody. I saw the combined lineup and it’s really funny – 11 Liverpool players and no Man United players.“That is the situation everyone creates: that we are so good and they have so many problems, they can not play football anymore and we are flying. All this stuff gets built up in a week when there have been no other games. That is what I mean about building a banana skin. It is like we just have to go there and don’t respect them on the level they deserve. We need to respect them to face the difficulties in the game and it will be there in the right way.”Liverpool’s victory over United at Anfield last season marked the end of José Mourinho’s reign but was also their only win in the last 10 league meetings between the clubs. Klopp admits he would try to turn the insults that Solskjær has faced to his advantage were the roles reversed.When asked to name one United player who would get in a combined team with Liverpool, however, Klopp chose the diplomatic line.“I was always completely happy with my players and I don’t look at other players,” he replied. “If you asked me about Barcelona I will tell you the same. I don’t want to have any Barcelona players in this specific Liverpool team at the moment.I am completely happy with my team. There’s no difference – no Bayern player or Dortmund player, nothing – this is the team and I am completely happy with that.”Klopp, meanwhile, has said it is unacceptable to force City to play twice in under 48 hours over the festive period due to television demands, but had rejected the champions’ claims that December’s schedule hands Liverpool an advantage in the title race. Liverpool have their own issues over Christmas with an 8pm kick-off at Leicester on Boxing Day, days after their return from the Club World Cup in Qatar, but Klopp has only sympathy for the demands placed on Pep Guardiola’s players.“We have a game more in December than City. How can we have an advantage?” he said. “But I am completely on City’s side that these games where they have 46 hours between should not happen. It’s like when we played Sunderland, it’s just not OK. That was in 2016 and three years later we are still speaking about it.The Liverpool defender Joël Matip, meanwhile, has signed a new five-year contract with the club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef8c0dae2f5178459c96b38b6c78eb29c0870551/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7b8e389b174062225d2639ddd1b837b","title":"ngolo kante premier league midfielder real madrid juventus chelsea","story":"It is no surprise that Real Madrid and Juventus are said to be coming for Chelsea’s Kanté – the Frenchman has conquered all before him over the last four yearsRemember the N’Golo Kanté riots of 2018? Those were high times, man. It seems strange now but this time last year one of the key issues in the Premier League’s endless conversation with itself, and a source of febrile ambient rage well beyond the Chelsea fanbase, was the apparent misuse of Kanté by overseas book-learning type Maurizio Sarri.The spark in this tinderbox was the decision to play Jorginho as the deeper of Chelsea’s midfield pairing. As part of this shift Kanté was moved a few yards from his previous starting position. He was encouraged to make a number of additional forward runs. Cue: outrage.It was a strangely protective fury. On radio shows, in newspaper columns, on the swirling brain-thoughts of social media, the angry talking heads leapt up. There was a sense of gallantry, defending Kanté’s honour, like pipe‑smoking 1950s fathers shooing a motorbike gang from the front porch while their teenage daughter cowers at the screen door. Nobody puts N’Golo in the corner!And yet the strangest thing about the Kanté uprising was: it wasn’t really a thing. Sarri went on to all but destroy Chelsea by finishing third, winning a European trophy, giving Callum Hudson-Odoi 26 games and behaving with discrete good grace while being yelled at by Spam-faced men with weirdly overwrought opinions on the precise calibration of the two-man midfield pivot.Kanté and Jorginho, intelligent footballers, made it work well enough. Fast forward a year and Chelsea’s two best wins of the season, away at Lille and Southampton, have coincided with their resumption of a two-man midfield. The news that Kanté will probably miss Saturday’s game against Newcastle after twanging his hamstring with France looks the biggest obstacle to a resumption of their recent surge.Plus, there has been some other news this week. Real Madrid and Juventus have let it be known, through the usual channels, that they may just be coming for Kanté. Not that anyone really believes these stories, product of what the authors of The Club, a brilliantly detailed anatomy of Premier League shenanigans, describe as “the gossip-industrial complex”.There are obvious holes in the Kanté to Madrid yarn. First Chelsea aren’t selling anyone and secondly the article on the DesMarque website states that Kanté “dreams of wearing white and leaving Chelsea. He believes they do not aspire to winning important titles with Frank Lampard”.Yeah, right. Does this sound like the N’Golo that you know? What were his exact words? He didn’t like the deal – but he has to go along with it?It is at least no surprise to hear that Kanté should be in demand. He has been lionised in England, adopted as a Premier League force of nature. Albeit there has always been something showy about some of the excitement, a sense of overcompensation.The covering midfielder, the anchor, is not a position English football has historically prized. In Kanté we got it, a defensive shield of such energy, with such a flatteringly concussive Premier League style that it became a badge of sophistication to praise him and a possible source of that backlash when a gangly foreign manager who looks as though he’s stepped out to the all-night garage in search of a tin of slim panatellas tried to change him, to bring other layers out of a champion footballer.It is fair to ask why bother. Kanté is seriously good at this. He made the most tackles in Europe’s top leagues two seasons in a row. Last season, in a team that had the ball most of the time, he still blocked more passes per game than any other regular Premier League midfielder.This is his superpower, the ability to take an advanced eye for space and movement, the famous picture a creative player has in their head, and to use that three-second glimpse forward into the revolving angles, the shifting pieces not to create, but to destroy and staunch and intercept.Still, Kanté has been doing other things. As long ago as last year’s Champions League defeat by Barcelona at the Camp Nou he produced a brilliantly complete all‑round midfield display against Ivan Rakitic, Sergio Busquets and Andrés Iniesta.He has played three league games this year but nobody has scored so many goals while also making so many tackles in that time. The pet destroyer is the best all-round midfielder in the Premier League.And why not? The image of Kanté has always been circumscribed. The story about him working as a rubbish picker in the Paris suburbs as a child feeds into this notion of some humble, saintly automaton. But Kanté is also a qualified accountant. When he refused to take his Chelsea wages through a shell company perhaps it wasn’t because he’s a holy soul looking beyond the material plane, but because he understands financial regulation and accounting practices better than most.Similarly, the idea of Kanté as a servant to the stars seems restrictive. We hear that he “let Paul Pogba play” at the World Cup, that his yeoman presence liberates others. Maybe what’s happening here is that they’re watching Kanté play, a footballer who, in four years, has won four major club trophies and a World Cup medal for three teams, each one transformed by his presence.Probably we should try to enjoy him while we can, starting with Ajax on Tuesday our own preciously guarded midfield shield, who – whisper it quietly – has become a little more than simply that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e16c86b7e56e2d03529b241e62e2da1229415031/226_520_5534_3320/master/5534.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2f62f3e3b3bab670332f0cd5d83c8de","title":"romesh ranganathan takes on family fortnite","story":"After an expert training session for me and my mum, will this be a bonding experience? Or will my boys request a new father?A while ago, I wrote a column about the ision in my family that Fortnite was creating, with my kids playing it nonstop and then allowing me to play before confirming that I was, as I feared, a “noob” (translation: someone without skill in the area of gaming).This was distressing, as I have always considered myself a gamer. Admittedly I became slightly disenfranchised when online gaming emerged, which allows you to play anyone from anywhere, as, for me, the whole point of gaming is escapism. And escapism, to my mind, is not being repeatedly beaten at a game by an 11-year-old from Ohio while he calls me a “little bitch”.Before all that, though, I was an addict. At my sons’ age, I was locked into my Amiga 500. I used to play Batman, the New Zealand Story, Rainbow Islands, Speedball. I remember playing Wonderboy and getting to the very last level, after hundreds of attempts, before my younger brother, in an effort to help, accidentally pressed a key that exited the game, burst into tears and ran away. I felt so bad for him. I also loved him slightly less after that.I remember becoming so entranced by Super Mario World on the Nintendo 64 that I sat down to play it at 5pm in my student accommodation and stayed there until I had finished the game at 8am the following morning. This shows you both how much I loved gaming, and also how truly pathetic my university social life was. But that’s for another time.My gaming past means I feel the disconnect with my children all the more keenly. I end up saying things such as, “I used to game, you know, and in my day they were proper games, not all this claptrap”, and they look at me like some sort of ancient artefact they have no interest in. And then they carry on playing Fortnite.Don’t get me wrong: we have had some fun times gaming together. We play each other at Mario Kart, and I even invested in loads of Nintendo Labo kits, where you build cardboard tools with which to play the games. What this has mainly involved is the kids watching me trying to put something together repeatedly, before losing my temper and my wife asking the kids to “leave Daddy to calm down for a bit”.When my Fortnite column was published, the noted egamer Frankie Ward got in touch on Twitter and offered to give me some training. This felt like a dream come true: I could become good at Fortnite, win the respect of my kids, and then use that respect to turn them against their mother somehow. I contacted Frankie, but she was on her way to an etournament in Sweden, so she arranged for esports commentator Daniel Falcone (yes, that’s a thing, and a lucrative one) to come to Crawley and help us out.I thought it would be fun to get all the family involved. I asked my wife, and she immediately said no. She is happy to game with the kids, but as soon as she heard there might be a photo in the , she made it very clear that she was out. My mother, on the other hand, was keen as mustard before I had even explained what we were going to do. This implies that she was desperate to get into the paper, but the truth is, my mum is perpetually frustrated at how little she sees us this was more of an opportunity to spend some time with the grandkids.It also occurred to me that my mum being able to play Fortnite might be the best thing ever for her relationship with the boys. They currently see her as the loud woman who kisses them way too much when she turns up at their house. Most of their time with her is spent doing that cartoon-eyeballs-popping-out thing while my mum hugs the life out of them. It might be beneficial for them to see her as a Fortnite player. Additionally, it would be nice for me to have somebody present whom I can definitely beat.My mum saw my brother and me grow up with computer games, and has always been bemused by how much we love them. Occasionally, she has expressed distaste for what’s being played (she finds beat-’em-ups to be a damning indictment of human nature), so I wondered how she was going to take to a game that required you to drop on to an island and kill absolutely everybody else there until you are the last person standing, in what many have dubbed the “post-Brexit simulator”. The day of the training arrives. Daniel has set up three screens, and the boys start playing immediately, admiring the “skins” Daniel has chosen (this is your onscreen avatar, which could be anything from a robot sentinel to a skirting-pretty-close-to-licensing laws version of Chief Hopper from Stranger Things). While the boys play, Mum and I receive our basic training before preparing to fight it out as a family.Mum goes first. Daniel begins by setting us up in an empty, onscreen environment so we can familiarise ourselves with the game. As well as running around and picking up weapons, we have to look out for rejuvenating potions we can also build things to hide behind, which is apparently the skill that distinguishes the really great players. I understand that games are not rooted in reality, but the idea that you would knock up a fence while being shot at feels like something you wouldn’t even suggest at a development meeting, let alone allow as a big part of the game. Having said that, my son is playing as a banana, so I might be judging this by the wrong criteria.Daniel watches Mum for a little bit and then adjusts his tasks accordingly. Instead of showing us how to use various weapons and execute some cool kills, he very quickly ascertains that he is going to have to scaffold the learning a bit. He asks my mum to try something simple – walking into a house. That takes half an hour. You use the right-hand stick to control where you are looking, and the left-hand stick to control where you are walking. Mum spends most of that half an hour walking into a wall while looking up at the sky. I start telling her what to do, and she asks me how come I am already so good at this I realise that her problem is that she has no experience of gaming at all. By dint of simply having played a game, any game, I am able to move around with no problem.It is both a relief to know she is that crap, and incredibly frustrating to watch. I keep saying things such as, “Oh my God, Mum, are you serious?” as she once again fails to walk through a door. Again and again she imprisons herself in a room, completely unable to leave, putting me and the boys into hysterics.But then the boys do something wonderful. With Daniel’s help, they realise that they are going to have to help their grandmother pick up the basics. So they join the game and start leaving various weapons and potions around where she is playing, giving her little tests in how to pick things up and access them. They talk her through what to do, and congratulate her when she manages it. She is loving it. They start positioning themselves in places and asking her to try to shoot them. They don’t even mind when she asks them to get closer and then, as she tries to shoot, looks up at the sky hundreds of times. I am actually impressed.Then it is my turn for training, and I have to confess that here I am slightly envious of my mum. While Daniel is brilliant, my mum’s inexperience means that absolutely everything she does leads to a family celebration: shoot someone, applause! Walk out of a room, applause! Manage to spend 30 seconds without looking up at the sky, applause! While the boys remain supportive, I receive no accolades for my efforts they already expect me to be a certain standard. I am beginning to regret bringing Mum. This woman will be declared a champion simply for managing to walk out of a room.Daniel explains that I am justified in finding Fortnite hard. It is a notoriously difficult game to get to grips with, particularly because you have to start playing against other online players, who are already brilliant at it. Your early experiences are mainly getting killed almost immediately, and then waiting for another game to start. It’s a hurdle that Fortnite’s makers have addressed, somewhat controversially, by introducing game-controlled bots, which aren’t as good as real-life players. The idea is that you can practise against those, rather than be murdered by a group of kids who have spent 10 hours a day playing from their mum’s basement for the last six months. (The other thing Fortnite’s makers did, last weekend, was replace the whole game with a black hole, before unveiling Chapter 2 and a rebooted world two days later. Which means we might need to train all over again.)Our family session completed, the tournament begins. The idea is simple: whoever first completes a kill will be declared the winner. Daniel has set up a “rumble”, so that if you are killed you will simply reappear and keep going, with that death going against your team’s score. It is my eldest son, Theo, v Mum v me. Theo immediately bags himself a kill and is declared victorious, but Mum and I play on out of sheer pride. I have everything on the line here a defeat will be unrecoverable in terms of gaining any kind of respect. I will have no choice but to offer the kids the opportunity to request a new father, one who can assemble Nintendo Labo structures, and move on to a new life.Fortunately, the online players of Fortnite prove my saviours. They are all very good, so it quickly becomes obvious that neither Mum nor I is going to have any chance of killing them. Every time either of us approach anything like a scrap, we are dispatched immediately. One particular player identifies me as a weak link and keeps seeking me out to kill me again. This is not my proudest moment.Daniel says he is willing to wait in the studio until one of us gets a kill, but it feels slightly unfair to keep him here for a month. So Theo is declared the winner, and Mum and I hug as worthy losers, before she is once again applauded for having given it a go.Has my training turned me into the expert I hoped I could be? Certainly not. But it has given us some quality family time, the sort I might previously have assumed was possible only through the medium of board games or days out. The boys enjoyed teaching us about “their” game. And I have been reminded of how hilarious it is when your parents are irretrievably rubbish at something. We have all agreed to have another go sometime.

The whole family knows I never write anything. An old girlfriend once said my letter read like a social security card. My favourite poem is Ode To A Girdle*, partly because of its brevity. And this is a fine time to try to get me to start writing. I’m 98: when I get an idea into my head, I forget what it was before I can write it down. Why not wait till I’m 100?I live with three of my six grandsons, a seven-year-old and three-year-old twins, in Connecticut. It’s mayhem, but we had four children in four years, so I’m used to mayhem. One time we were going to visit my wife’s parents and had all the kids and the dog in the car. When I started driving, I realised we had left a suitcase on the roof, because our clothes were flying all around the road. When I stopped to retrieve them, the dog tried to get out and I accidentally shut the door on his ear. He flew around the car, shaking blood everywhere and scratching up the kids until everyone was howling.The twins’ father – Tim’s brother – has them enrolled in every athletic event in North America. He recently had them challenge me to a running race. We went down to the beach, where my son drew a starting line and a finish line in the sand, and shouted: “Ready, set, go.”I had a bad start and came in third. A few days later there was a rematch: 25 yards, this time on grass. I lost, because I stepped in a chipmunk hole the little bastard dug two holes six inches apart. I’m working towards a third race, somewhere flat. Now that the state has taken away my driver’s licence and I have to walk everywhere, my legs are starting to round into shape. I’ll leave those shrimps in the dust.Actually, the state didn’t take away my licence. When I got notice that it would expire on my 98th birthday, I figured they would never give me a new one, so I sold my car. Then I found out that, in America anyway, they will renew your licence no matter how old you are, as long as you pay the fee. I went to get one, just for identification purposes. They asked if I wanted to renew it for six more years, but I only did two.I do miss my car. There was never a chance of me having an accident. Everybody got out of the way as soon as they saw me coming. I’m thinking about getting a golf cart instead.Lately, I’ve been looking into medications for memory loss. I can’t recall what I had for lunch, but I can clearly remember things that happened 90 years ago, like the fight between Florence Parker and Sylvia Needles on the lawn of the Methodist church. That’s where all the kids went to fight, because it had a nice grassy lawn. Kids seemed to fight a lot back then.But the doctors say the medication route is not promising they say it’s a waste of money. What they recommend is exercise, and a good diet.I think fear is the greatest problem of the elderly. It prevents you from doing the things you like doing. I used to be a distance swimmer, racing across harbours all over the state, but now I swim only where I can touch the bottom. Lately, I’ve been swallowing water when I swim, so I started doing backstroke. It works fine, as long as I don’t swim into a boat.The point is not to worry about the fear too much: do as much as you can, and take advice from friends and relatives.This is news to me. I can only imagine my father is referring to On A Girdle, by the English lyric poet Edmund Waller (1606-1687), which begins:“That which her slender waist confin’d,Shall now my joyful temples bind.”He’s right, though, it is brief: three stanzas, 12 lines, a mere 83 words in total."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ce274e2850bd908bf9819d3f6346cd7ef2d9f41/89_0_3285_1971/master/3285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=064f423f4995e462705b014d0bb24cdc","title":"how tv music supervisors boost new artists","story":"Streaming services are pouring money into finding the right tracks for their shows – and sometimes, obscure is bestThe influx of money from streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Apple TV into music supervision and licensing has helped to compensate artists for falling record sales, according to one of the sector’s most prominent figures.Music supervisors used to be a rarely mentioned role, but the investment in TV from streaming platforms has made having impeccable music supervision another vital element in a standout series. “Some people think supervision is like fantasy football for music,” says Zach Cowie, one of the new breed of music supervisors. “But there is a lot of stuff you need to know beyond just selecting good music.”Cowie – who worked at record labels and toured with Animal Collective and Fleet Foxes before becoming a DJ and moving into music supervision – has worked on Netflix’s Master of None, Amazon’s Forever, Kirsten Dunst’s series On Becoming a God in Central Florida, and Apple’s forthcoming anthology show Little America.Cowie says his work on a show should ideally start when the scripts are still being written, rather than in the editing room, where a supervisor attempts to find, match and license a song for a scene that was shot weeks ago. For Master of None, which was Cowie’s first music supervision project for Netflix, he worked with showrunners Alan Yang and Aziz Ansari to pick songs, which were then written into scenes. “We can pre-clear the track and shoot to the song, rather than doing it in the edit,” says Cowie. “The nightmare is finding something that everyone gets attached to and then not getting the clearance.”Jen Malone, a music supervisor on Atlanta and Euphoria, the HBO and Sky Atlantic teen drama about a dysfunctional American town, found tracks for Euphoria by screengrabbing songs people shared on Instagram. “Whenever I have downtime, I take out my phone and I go through all of the screenshots and listen to the music,” she told the Fader. “And if it’s good for Euphoria, it’ll go in the Euphoria bin. If it’s good for one of my other shows, I’ll throw it in there.”Cowie’s holistic approach is unusual, with supervisors often spending hours in editing bays ensuring songs fit and more time securing licensing. Thomas Golubić, a veteran supervisor who is president of the Guild of Music Supervisors and best known for his work with Vince Gilligan on Breaking Bad, describes supervisors as the “Swiss army knives of post-production”. “We have many different roles and sometimes nobody ever needs to take the screwdriver out,” Golubić told Red Bull Music Academy earlier this year. “Sometimes you just need the saw and a pair of scissors.”The role of music supervision has started to be recognised within the music industry. Last year’s Grammys was the first in which music supervisors were eligible to win in the compilation soundtrack album category, a step Golubić described as “long overdue”.Cowie can’t discuss exact figures for song licensing, but says that artists fall roughly into four groups. The most expensive music to secure is on a major label, followed by what Cowie calls the “major indies”. Then there are the “indy indies”, which cost a bit less, and then artist-owned music, which is generally the cheapest to secure.“As everyone knows, you don’t make shit from streaming, record sales are down and you have to be at a certain level to make any money from music,” he says. “But the right commercial or show can finance your next project. I like being in that Robin Hood position.” Cowie sees the role as being a way to support more obscure artists, and insists licensing budgets are at a certain level before he will even begin to talk to a studio about a project.But picking obscure tracks can cause problems. Cowie decided to used hard-to-clear Italo Disco tracks such as Pino d’Angio’s Okay Okay in an episode of Master of None’s second season. “The number-one source of drama in my job is getting someone attached to something we can’t keep,” says Cowie. “There’s this phenomenon called ‘temp love’ where you cut a scene with a track, everyone loves it and you figure out you can’t keep it, and no one will ever be happy with anything else.”But there is a practical benefit to finding more obscure songs to include, too. “At a certain point some of these songs are going to run out of emotional steam because they’ve been attached to so many things. The right unknown song, in the right scene, can do so much for your story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd67411371a9a294fd623e369476d85222ea87b5/0_332_5592_3356/master/5592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98dd06efe01e9af0590fde47a87e7de8","title":"on the frontline as us troops leave northern syria","story":"Martin Chulov, who covers the Middle East for the , has spent the past week on the frontline of north-east Syria.

But this would not get Brexit done. It will, instead, be the start of a long and bitter series of negotiations for our country which could still end in a no deal outcome.”The former prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major have also united to make a short film warning against Brexit and its impact on Northern Ireland to be broadcast at the rally.The pair, who faced each other across the dispatch box between 1994 and 1997 and helped broker the Good Friday agreement, have both been vociferous in their calls to avoid a hard Brexit.Blair said: “The Good Friday agreement was a careful, painstaking construction in which the conflicting aspirations of unionists and nationalists were held in the most delicate balance.“Now either there is a hard border between Northern Ireland and Britain or a hard border between the north and south of Ireland. And it is a shame and an outrage that peace in Northern Ireland is now treated as some disposable inconvenience to be bartered away in exchange for satisfying the obsession of the Brexiteers with wrenching our country out of Europe.”Major, who has made several high-profile interventions against Brexit, said: “There’s a whole generation of people in Northern Ireland who have no memory of what life was like before the Good Friday agreement. No one under the age of 20 would have any memory of the violence and death that once engulfed their neighbourhoods. I hope and pray they never do.”The People’s Vote march will set off from Park Lane at midday and reach Parliament Square at 2pm with a rally lasting 90 minutes for speakers to address the crowds.It was scheduled for 19 October to coincide with the provisions of Labour MP Hilary Benn’s act. The Benn act legislated for Saturday to be the deadline by which a deal needed to be passed or the prime minister must request an extension of article 50 from the EU.The rally may be one of the best attended of the three People’s Vote demonstrations so far, with a record 172 coaches bringing in campaigners from across the country. Previous marches are believed to have attracted between 500,000 and a million people.Pauline Hardman, a food bank volunteer, is travelling to London for the first time from Ushaw Moor in County Durham – a former mining village.She did not vote in the 2016 referendum but said she feared Brexit would damage former coal communities in the north.She said: “People in mining villages like mine are getting more and more worried about the damage Brexit will cause. We can see it’s a million miles from what was promised back in 2016, we know this matters and we want to have our say.“If you read the newspapers, you’d think that everyone in the north-east thinks exactly the same way, that we all want Brexit whatever the cost, but that’s not what I hear when I speak to my neighbours and friends.”Another marcher will be Stephen Goodall, 97, who served in the far east during during the second world war and is travelling to the protest from his home in south Devon.He said: “I’m 97 years old, my knees are knackered from playing rugby, and I’ll be in a wheelchair, but as long as I’m still alive and kicking, I’ll march to defend the democracy I’ve always fought to protect.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will be supporting the event, as well as the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the Labour MPs David Lammy, Benn, Jess Phillips and Chi Onwurah.The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and her party’s MPs Ed Davey, Layla Moran, Luciana Berger and Sam Gyimah will be attending, as will the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, Anna Soubry, the independent MP Antoinette Sandbach, Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts, the SNP’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, and the SNP MP Joanna Cherry.The new Brexit deal is essentially the old\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a\u0026nbsplink to the full text.The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.The cost of a number of the coaches has been covered by supporters including the TV chef Delia Smith, who is paying for transport from Norwich and Bury St Edmunds. Patrick Stewart is paying for a coach from Huddersfield and the writer and director Armando Iannucci is meeting the cost of coaches from Oxford.The Brexit protest group Led By Donkeys unveiled its latest stunt to coincide with the crunch vote and march.The words “Britain now wants to remain” was ploughed into a field in Wiltshire in 40-metre letters visible from passing aircraft.The group released a video shot from a helicopter, with a voiceover by Lisa Dodd, who voted leave. She said: “I voted leave because of the NHS. I just can’t believe I fell for it. Manipulated wasn’t I, well and truly?

Our collective hope rests on brave Labour MPs, and indeed others, who can see that.”Onn, who comes from a working-class background and grew up in Grimsby, was considered a rising star in the party before she resigned from a frontbench role in March in protest at Labour’s support for a second referendum.The Democratic Unionist party opposes Johnson’s deal and is encouraging Conservative MPs to vote against it, meaning the prime minister is likely to need to win over more Labour MPs than the handful of ardent Brexiters who supported Theresa May’s deal.The Labour leadership have said Johnson’s deal shifts the “level playing field” pledges on workers’ rights and environmental standards from the legally binding withdrawal agreement to the political declaration. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said on Friday he did not expect more than a few Labour MPs to be won over.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I don’t believe there are Labour MPs out there who will not think through the detail of this deal and then, when they see the impact – particularly on environmental, consumers’ and workers’ rights – will vote for it.”Among the Labour MPs who have said they will vote for the deal are Jim Fitzpatrick, who represents Poplar and Limehouse in London, and Ronnie Campbell, the MP for Blyth Valley in the north-east.Asked about Campbell’s views, McDonnell said: “I’m going to have a chat with Ronnie because he is a good socialist and all his life he has fought alongside me to protect trade union rights and develop trade union rights.“On this one I’m going to have a chat with him and point out to him: please do not give this power to Boris Johnson, because you know what he’ll do. He’ll undermine trade union rights. Boris Johnson and those Tory MPs that populate the cabinet, these are the extreme right who have attacked trade unions throughout their political careers.”He added: “No MP, as far as I’m concerned, who has the true interest of their constituents at heart can allow that to happen.”Several more Labour MPs who in the past have expressed their preference for a Brexit deal over a second referendum will continue considering their decision overnight.One said colleagues were finding the decision very difficult, with more than one in tears at a recent meeting. They suggested trades unions were ringing round MPs saying they would not receive financial support in future if they voted with the government.Many of the “MPs for a deal” group, which includes Onn and Prentis, are likely to support the Letwin amendment, which effectively delays the final decision. They would then hope to amend the withdrawal agreement, potentially to allow more reassurances on workers’ rights and other issues.Jon Lansman, the chair of pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum, suggested the party’s ruling national executive committee could replace Labour MPs who defied the whip.Corbyn himself has hinted he is minded to take a gentler approach, saying: “I believe in the power of persuasion rather than the power of threat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe08ff31f6620ca528e6e26f10b217cccc095fc/0_55_5099_3059/master/5099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f71e3dc9c2b6fc41bfb55976082636","title":"pm faces brexit extension even if his deal is passed","story":"Labour and former Tory MPs join in bid to force through extension with amendment on ‘super Saturday’Boris Johnson’s plan to push through a Brexit deal on Saturday looks likely to be frustrated after an alliance of Labour and former Tory MPs united behind a plan to force a new extension.After clinching a last-minute deal in Brussels on Thursday by agreeing to a customs border in the Irish Sea, the prime minister had hoped to frame the rare Saturday sitting of parliament as a dramatic “new deal or no deal” moment.But despite positive reactions from Bank of England governor Mark Carney and declarations of support from several Labour MPs, Johnson’s plans were rocked on Friday by a cross-party group led by Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn.The Conservative and Labour MPs will table an amendment allowing parliament to withhold its approval until the legislation to implement Brexit has passed.With Labour expected to back it, as well as rebel Conservatives including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, it appears likely to pass.Letwin has insisted that his plan is not to block a deal. But the move would mean that even if Johnson secured the support of a majority of MPs, he would fail to pass the test set by the Benn act for Brexit to go ahead by 31 October, which sets a deadline of 11pm on Saturday.The prime minister would then be legally obliged to request an extension from the EU27 – something he has repeatedly insisted he will not do.Johnson would not need to make use of the extension, if he could pilot his Brexit bill through all its parliamentary stages before 31 October. But it would decisively remove the risk of a no-deal Halloween Brexit.News of the amendment came as a serious blow to Johnson, with strategists meeting on Friday night to try to decide how to respond if it passed.Despite the fact that several of its supporters repeatedly backed Theresa May’s deal – unlike Johnson himself – No 10 sources sought to claim it was a thinly-veiled bid to block Brexit.“We can all see what this is about,” one said. “It’s being exploited by a bunch of people who are finding ever more inventive ways of not delivering on Brexit. They are not prepared to vote for a deal.”Downing Street has repeatedly insisted it will comply with the law – but also that Johnson is determined to leave on 31 October, come what may. If he fails to send the letter, or seeks to frustrate the law in any other way, he is likely to face a legal challenge.Meanwhile, as the scramble to win the knife-edge vote unfolded on Friday, several Labour MPs and previously unreconciled Tory Brexiters declared their backing for the agreement. But the numbers for and against Johnson’s deal appeared too close to call.Johnson told the BBC on Friday night: “There’s no better outcome than the one I’m advocating tomorrow.”Urging MPs to support him, he said: “I just kind of invite everybody to imagine what it could be like tomorrow evening, if we have settled this, and we have respected the will of the people, because we will then have a chance to to move on.”Melanie Onn, the Labour MP for Grimsby, was one of several who announced they were prepared to support a deal, in the face of intense pressure from senior party figures to reject it.In an article for the , written with Conservative MP Victoria Prentis, Onn said that the pair intended “to implore our colleagues to use this unique chance to help us move on, and get back to helping our constituents”.“The risk of letting this final shot at a deal slip through our fingers is too great,” the pair add. “Our collective hope rests on brave Labour MPs, and indeed others, who can see that.”Tensions among political leaders ratcheted up ahead of Saturday’s vote as the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, pointed the finger at the Labour leader for not being tough enough in opposing Johnson’s deal.Sturgeon accused Jeremy Corbyn of presiding over an atmosphere within Labour where his MPs believe that if they defy the three-line whip and back the PM, they will not face any consequences such as being ejected from the parliamentary party.She said: “My growing suspicion is that Labour will allow Boris Johnson to get his deal over the line.“It seems to me that it is possible we have a situation where Labour have an official position of opposing this deal but are giving nods and winks to so-called Labour rebels in the hope that there’s enough of them that allow it over the line.”Meanwhile, Carney used a US television appearance to say the deal agreed between London and Brussels would boost growth and could be a turning point for the global economy.In an interview with Bloomberg TV in Washington, he said: “It is good news that there is an agreement. I would expect the economy to pick up from quite a subdued pace.”Carney said the EU referendum had been the start of a period of trade uncertainty that had caused the global economy to slow. “The UK may have led the world into this and we may be leading the world out of this,” he said.Labour has vehemently rejected Johnson’s deal. Keir Starmer warned that it would “pave the way for a decade of deregulation” and “give Johnson licence to slash workers’ rights, environmental standards and consumer protections”.The scope for the Letwin amendment to succeed will partly be framed by the response of European leaders. Jean-Claude Juncker suggested in Brussels on Thursday that a request for an extension could be rejected – but other senior EU figures did not follow his lead.If the amendment passes, instead of a yes or no to Johnson’s Brexit deal, MPs would then be given the opportunity of voting on the amended motion – which would say they have not yet approved the deal.Some of those backing the idea, including Letwin, would like to support Johnson’s deal, but had become alarmed that it could pass on Saturday – allowing Johnson to escape the strictures of the backbench Benn act – but then fall at a later stage in the ratification process, leading to a no-deal Brexit.The move came as Johnson and his team launched a charm offensive, aimed at tempting potential waverers from across the political spectrum to support his agreement, which paves the way for a significantly looser future relationship with the EU.In a last-ditch attempt to win over vital Labour votes to secure his Brexit deal, he released fresh details of government commitments on workers’ rights and environmental standards.He is also offering a parliamentary lock on the future partnership with EU which will allow MPs a vote on the government’s negotiating objectives and a meaningful vote once talks have concluded.As part of his raft of new commitments, Johnson has promised to maintain high standards of workers’ rights in the withdrawal agreement legislation when it goes before MPs.A minister would also have to explain to MPs where any new bill could affect employment rights and compatibility with the EU. There would be an obligation on the government to report regularly on new EU measures and whether it would mirror them. MPs would also get to vote on this report.In terms of environmental policy, Johnson has said he will look at cooperating with European agencies where it supports the national interest.He also pledged not to open up British markets for goods that do not meet the UK’s high standards, and that the UK will not sign trade deals that export the environmental cost of its consumption to the rest of the world.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The UK has a long and proud tradition of leading the way in workers’ rights and environmental protections where we have always set a high standard. We recognise that MPs want to see these hard-won rights protected, not weakened by our departure from the EU.”If the vote on Johnson’s deal goes ahead without any amendments, the decision could be agonisingly tight, with the decisions of the handful of MPs yet to indicate a preference potentially swinging the result.With the threshold needed for a Commons majority of 320, once Sinn Féin MPs and the Speaker and his deputies are excluded, a  tally of the two sides put them virtually neck and neck.A key constituency yet to declare was pro-deal Labour MPs informally led by Caroline Flint, who have been heavily courted by No 10. These calculations would be completely different if the Letwin amendment was to pass, with a series of potential opponents sufficiently reassured to back the government plan.However, on the other side of the equation, some hardline Tory Brexiters might become more wary of supporting a plan which would inevitably require another Brexit extension."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79729bf3ff5a9150b5d54aafd7740d4ea677550b/0_0_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a58dc9fcaf5a7ac8eff1574c380718","title":"pivot point for scotland as brexit boosts independence bid","story":"Polling suggests breakup of union increasingly likely and thoughts turning to aftermathThat the union is under greater stress than at any time in its 300-year history is something that everyone from Scotland’s first minister to former Conservative and Labour prime ministers and Whitehall thinktanks agree upon.Nicola Sturgeon told delegates at the SNP conference in Aberdeen on Tuesday that successive Westminster governments had “shattered the case for the union” and that she would demand within weeks the legal powers to hold a second independence referendum in 2020.The following day the Institute for Government published a report stating that a no-deal Brexit would leave the union at breaking point and that it would be “unsustainable and counterproductive” for the UK government to block another referendum.Certainly, there are also concerns that ongoing alignment along the Irish border will inevitably fuel calls for a united Ireland. “There is definitely the sense we are at a pivot point,” says Angus Robertson, the SNP’s former Westminster leader and now managing director of Progress Scotland, an independence polling organisation. “If Boris Johnson and the Tories are saying now that they have a deal that solves all the problems, it doesn’t.”“People also say they want to see the impact of Brexit before they decide to do something else,” Robertson adds. “But there has also been a growth in support for another referendum within the next two years, and a sense amongst respondents that there is an inevitability to becoming independent.”Cat Boyd, a co-founder of the Radical Independence Campaign, a left-green group that carried out voter registration drives on working-class estates in 2014, says it is striking that five years after the first referendum, ideas that were considered fringe – a green new deal, workers on boards, opposing austerity – are now part of the mainstream political discourse in Scotland.But Boyd worries about the balance of a coming campaign. “The independence movement isn’t just the SNP, as we spent a lot of the 2013-14 campaign telling people, but they will have the majority of the money and resources. I worry that they’ll take the working-class vote – that massive turnout in areas where people never voted before – for granted. If the next campaign is geared towards the professional middle classes, what is there to motivate the rest?”Devine suggests there should be some focus on what would happen after a vote in favour of independence. The maintenance of a social union with England, as well as what form of trade barrier would exist with Scotland’s biggest market, would depend of the goodwill of the governing party in London at the time.Furthermore, there would be a pressing need for reconciliation: “The governing party in Scotland has a moral as well as political duty to assuage the doubts of those who will still vote against independence in the next referendum. This is a small country and currently split 5050. It’s difficult to see with such a profound change how those wounds can be healed in the short-term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c3dd3a118c354d7989642f2a6b5108924d82fd/242_0_3258_1956/master/3258.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=059c634725d0dbd693b828f91843ef30","title":"nasa all female spacewalk christina koch jessica meir","story":"Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, tasked with replacing faulty device at International Space Station, embarked on ‘historic’ effortTwo Nasa astronauts have embarked on the first all-female space walk in a historic first.Christina Koch and Jessica Meir floated feet-first out of the International Space Station’s (ISS) Quest airlock on Friday lunchtime UK time, tasked with replacing a failed power control unit.The spacewalk, known as an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) in astronaut jargon, took place seven months after the original planned date for an all-female outing, which had to be scrapped because the ISS had only one medium-sized spacesuit on board. The agency sent up a second medium spacesuit in October.“I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing,” Koch said ahead of the spacewalk. “In the past, women haven’t always been at the table. It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role. That can lead in turn to increased chance for success.”Koch, who has been on the ISS since March, was first out the hatch, followed by Meir, carrying a tool bag. During the five-and-a-half-hour spacewalk, the astronauts remained attached to handrails on the exterior of the ISS using harnesses and pairs of metal carabiners. These are sequentially clipped and unclipped to ensure that the astronauts cannot float off into space.Video footage from the astronauts’ helmet cameras, as they dangled 260 miles above Earth, provided a live stream of the painstaking operation to carry the new hardware, install it and then return the faulty battery to the airlock for a postmortem back on Earth into why it failed.Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a Nasa astronaut who completed three spacewalks as part of the Expedition 24 crew on the ISS in 2010, said: “This is significant … As much as it’s worth celebrating, many of us are looking forward to it just being normal.”During the spacewalk, the coordinator on the ground was Stephanie Wilson, also an astronaut.Koch, 40, is due to remain on the ISS until February, bringing her total time in space to 328 days, the longest single spaceflight by a woman and just short of Scott Kelly’s 340-day record. Researchers are collecting extensive biomedical data on the impact of spaceflight on Koch’s body.The majority of data available is on male astronauts, but there is some evidence that there are sex differences in responses to a space environment. One study found that women are more likely than men to experience faintness as a result of “orthostatic hypotension”, a cardiovascular issue. Men appear more prone to vision changes caused by spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (Sans).Previously, 14 women and 213 men have carried out spacewalks. The first woman was the Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who went outside the USSR’s Salyut 7 space station in 1984.On Tuesday, Nasa unveiled the prototype for a new spacesuit that could be worn by the next crew, expected to include a woman, to land on the moon. The suit is designed to give a customised fit to the inidual astronaut, whatever their shape or size."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2decab9182dfa945a1eff189d0c744e82615b8f3/0_113_4212_2528/master/4212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f488069c97b03a8100de330bec9659cc","title":"ireland new zealand all blacks rugby world cup quarter final kryptonite","story":"The All Blacks have not lost a Rugby World Cup match in 12 years but Steve Hansen will be wary of the men in green• We are expanding our coverage of New Zealand. Please help us by supporting our independent journalismNo one achieves victory over New Zealand by fluke. Joe Schmidt, who from the age of four was running around barefoot playing rugby in a small town in Waikato and dreaming of playing for the All Blacks, is only too aware of that. Having twice masterminded victories over the World Cup holders, he has spent the week assiduously plotting what would be the third and most momentous.There are thousands of Ireland supporters here. That they are armed with expectation rather than hope says everything about the difference Schmidt, the men in green’s head coach, has made in transforming a team who had conquered Europe into one who have won a Test in South Africa, a series in Australia and, after 111 years of trying, beaten New Zealand.They are, though, at a stage in the World Cup where they have never gone beyond: the quarter-finals. Their pool defeat to Japan, a result that jolted Ireland for a couple of weeks before they recovered their equilibrium against Samoa, earned them a date with New Zealand rather than South Africa, although the way the Springboks have been playing this year, Schmidt seems content with the devil he knows.Those that think New Zealand, who have picked a back ision short on experience, are vulnerable should take a breath. Only three countries have beaten the All Blacks in a World Cup: Australia, South Africa and France, twice each. The last time the holders were knocked out by a team who were not hosting the event was in 1999 when Les Bleus roused themselves into a stirring comeback at Twickenham.There are only two teams here whose names would cause a slight furrow in the brows of New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen: South Africa and Ireland, sides who since the last World Cup have caused the All Blacks problems through defensive line speed that has narrowed their attack and forced them to play at a slower pace. Unusually, they have struggled to find answers.New Zealand failed to score a try in a Dublin defeat last November, an evening when the pressure they were put under was so full-on and unyielding that even Kieran Read blew a golden chance: losing control of the ball in the corner as he chased a Beauden Barrett chip before Peter O’Mahony, somehow and from somewhere, denied him. It was a moment that summed up Ireland on a day when they gave everything and more, and O’Mahony returns to the side on Saturday in a symbolic move by Schmidt, but they have since struggled to live up to a performance that made the exceptional ordinary.New Zealand do not lose many matches. One reason is they carefully absorb the details of defeats before deciding how to react, not looking back in anger. Hansen has spent the year cultivating a back ision to thwart opponents with narrow vision. He has moved Barrett to full-back, but in broken play he is virtually an alternate fly-half to Richie Mo’unga, the positioning of the pair forcing defences to keep watching and redeploying.George Bridge and Sevu Reece have emerged as the two wings. They lack experience but as the New Zealand attack coach, Ian Foster, reflected on Friday, it means they play without fear or inhibition. Ireland know if they kick too long or turn the ball over, they will be playing the game on their opponents’ terms, but their half-backs and heartbeat, Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray, look back to their best and if the forecasted wet weather arrives, rain may not be the only drops as the All Blacks’ back three are aerially bombarded.Hansen remarked Ireland were effective because they rarely went off script while Schmidt pointed to the All Blacks as being at their most dangerous when turning over possession and switching in an instant from defence to attack. It sums up the two sides, the one meticulous in its preparation and detailed in its planning, the other also geared to play to a pattern but with the eye for a half-chance and the skill to exploit it.It has the potential to be the most epic of the quarter-finals, with both teams consumed by furious endeavour. Ireland to New Zealand since the last World Cup have become like kryptonite to Superman, Schmidt playing Lex Luther. It will be sayonara from Hansen or Schmidt, and to one of the two captains, Read and the admirable Rory Best – men who have served their teams with distinction – at the stage when this friendly World Cup turns cruel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9b223255ff0d1524166b1183075ad67323376b9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a0d917b448bc62af204e3d097c97c4a","title":"no quarter given rugby world up quarter finals","story":"The tournament has won millions of new fans in Japan and the onus is on the sport to keep them interested by providing a worthy spectacle in the quarter-finalsA storm blew into the sleepy little city of Oita on Friday morning. It brought thunder, lightning and tens of thousands of rugby fans from England, Australia, France and Wales. They found each other under the awnings around the central station, where they sang songs about Delilah and Matilda and all the unseemly things that went on in a Chicago department store, while the locals scurried by and sheltered inside. The World Cup has been running for a month already, but really, it is only just getting started. This weekend the eight best teams in the world square off and they all have a shot at winning to reach the semi-finals.The tens of thousands will be joined by tens of millions at kick-off. Half of Japan watched their team play Scotland on TV last Sunday, twice as many as watched their opening match against Russia. So whatever happens when they play South Africa in Tokyo on Sunday evening, the landscape of the game has changed in the past four weeks. The horizon is broader now. There are reams of saccharine quotes we could use, from one of those spurious online collections of inspirational sayings, all about how the point of travel is to learn about yourself as much as it is to visit somewhere else.Suffice to say rugby is discovering some good things about itself on this particular trip, that it can expand beyond its old heartlands and win over millions of new viewers. The Japanese even have a phrase for it: niwaka fans. Newcomers, bandwagon jumpers. Well hop on. And do not worry, the lyrics come easier than the laws, and are twice as much fun when you have learned them.It helps that Japan are winning. But it is true, too, that there is something there, at the heart of the game, that has drawn this audience to it. The superhuman speed, skill and ferocity, yes, but also its values too. Little things, such as the way the players have made a point of bowing to the crowd, and big ones, such as the footage of the Canadian team going out in the streets to help shovel up muck when the biggest game of their World Cup, against Namibia, had been cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. That stuff matters in a country where manners do too.They are values that some of the people running the game maybe need to be reminded of themselves. The only time they seem to pay them any mind is when they are reckoning what they can sell them for. There was a sighting of rugby’s old, narrow-minded parochialism in the petty squabble that blew up last weekend when the men in button-down shirts were busy bickering about which union had stitched up who while matches were being cancelled because the host country was dealing with the worst typhoon since the 1950s. If this World Cup has given us a glimpse of what the game could be, it has shown us, too, some of what is holding it back.You can also see that in the way some of the leading countries are all too happy to take from the Pacific Islands without giving anything worthwhile in return. And the way they, and the other emerging nations, struggle to get the fixtures they need against those top teams. And you have to guess that it is right there in the boardrooms where the English clubs and European countries are doing deals with CVC Capital, a vampire squid of a company who were accused of “raping the sport” after they got involved with F1. So yes, it is a good moment for rugby to show us its heart and soul.It starts on Saturday, when England play Australia. Eddie Jones compared the World Cup to a game of poker. Well, let’s see what he has got in his hand. He has spent four years getting the team ready for this, winnowing the best of English rugby, nasty, brutish and fast, from the worst, dull, lumpen and unimaginative. We are about to find out if it worked. Australia are a dangerous team to run into. Their coach, Michael Cheika, has been keeping his cards close to his chest. But he, and a couple of Australia’s best-ever players – Will Genia and David Pocock – know this could be the last game they play. They do not need another reason to want to beat England, but they have a few right there.Then in Tokyo, it is Ireland against the All Blacks, which would once have been a mismatch. Ireland had not beaten New Zealand in more than a hundred years of trying, now they have done it twice in three matches, which is one reason why no one really knows whether this is another good New Zealand team or whether it could become a great one. And if it seems as if Ireland have taken a step backwards since their famous victory against the All Blacks in Dublin, they still have Johnny Sexton, the world player of the year and a man who is not fooling around. He has played 147 minutes out of 320 in this World Cup, and Ireland are 78-8 up with him, 19-43 without.Wales play France on Sunday. Wales are being stretched pretty thin, but they have a coach, Warren Gatland and, a captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who know how to win. They have learned it across three Lions tours together, not to mention all those Six Nations’ grand slams. They have been impressively self-possessed, even though a scandal cost them their attack coach. They know exactly what they are about, whereas the French are still figuring it out. But they have a brilliantly bright bunch of young players, and finally have a coach, Fabien Galthié, who seems to have got them playing in their own inimitable way, even if he is still officially Jacques Brunel’s assistant.Then to cap it all off, Japan v South Africa, a rematch of the startling game at Brighton in 2015, when the rugby world first started to turn upside down. This South Africa team, shaped by Rassie Erasmus, steered by Siya Kolisi, sparked by Cheslin Kolbe, is better than the one who lost there. But Japan have improved exponentially too and, after the way they played in a 30-minute stretch against Scotland when they seemed untouchable, no one is sure what they may be capable of. Least of all the 60 million new fans, who know only that their team has won four Tests in a row.It is all unknown, like so much else about where the game is heading. But there is some hope, at least, that the game is going to show the best of itself, and that there are better things ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebfbc5e13d5dd25fc651240a73cc74e29836af62/68_261_2804_1683/master/2804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=051f5d2e5c35379afe245bfdeebf6230","title":"talking horses frankie dettori holds the aces on champions day card ascot horse racing tips","story":"Ascot has switched races on Champions Day to its jumps track but the supreme Flat jockey may come out on topWhen the Queen’s procession made its way down Ascot’s straight mile during the Royal meeting in June, the hurdles course on the inside of the main Flat track was a brown, parched desert. Four months later, the same strip of turf will ride to the rescue on Saturday, in an unexpected but vital role as the stage for Britain’s most valuable day at the races.There is nearly £4.5m on offer in the six races here on Champions Day, the only British card all year which has two contests with seven-figure prize funds. Had it not been for the fallback of shifting the meeting on the hurdles track, however, then at best we would have been waking up on Saturday morning with no certainty that the card would go ahead, or make it through to the final race if it did.Instead, a crowd of around 30,000 will arrive here on Saturday with action guaranteed. There will be an extra running rail between spectators and horses, and the runners will be several metres further away from the grandstand, which could be an irritation for some. Overall, however, the likelihood is that the overwhelming majority of racegoers will not really notice the difference.Horses and riders, on the other hand, certainly will. There was no need for a walking stick to test the ground on the two circuits here on Friday. A few short steps from the Flat course to the inner track was enough to appreciate the sharp contrast in the state of the ground. Officially, the inner course is good-to-soft, soft in places. The rest of the track, including the first half of the straight mile which hosts the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, is heavy.It is not ideal to be running one of the biggest days in British Flat racing on a jumps track, but when the championship afternoon of a summer sport is scheduled for the weekend before the clocks go back, there will always be times when we have to make the best of it.There is little point pretending that Saturday’s card is awash with genuine or even potential champions. The latest Longines world rankings include 23 horses with a rating of 121 or higher, of which 18 do most or all of their racing on turf and 14 are, or were, stabled in Europe this summer. Only three – Magical (Champion Stakes), Benbatl (QEII) and Straarius (Long Distance Cup) – have been declared to run at Ascot on Saturday, and John Gosden will walk the course before deciding whether to let Straarius take his chance. Arc weekend in Paris a fortnight ago had seven runners rated 121 or above, including four of the top five turf horses that are still in training.But what Ascot does have is Frankie Dettori on the first three favourites of the afternoon: Advertise (Champions Sprint), Straarius and Star Catcher (Filly \u0026amp Mares Stakes).As he reminded everyone when he rode the first four winners on Gold Cup day back in June, no-one can seize a moment or ride a wave quite like Dettori. A treble on these three rides alone currently multiplies out at around 25-1 and if all three were to oblige, then no-one at Ascot would pay much attention to the weather, the ground, the Brexit debate or anything else bar what Frankie is riding on the rest of the card. The answer, in the unlikely event that the question arises, is a second-favourite, a 10-1 shot and another favourite in the handicap at the end of the card.Many bookies responded to Dettori’s exploits in June by placing restrictions on multiple bets on his mounts on subsequent days at the Royal meeting. The indications on Friday, however, were that major firms at least will be laying the Dettori ‘Heinz’ – 57 bets, from doubles upwards – without too many quibbles. We can only hope that they are counting the cost as the evening draws in on Saturday. Greg WoodAidan O’Brien has won almost every top-class Flat race in Britain but one of the few to have evaded him is the Champion Stakes, now the centrepiece of Champions Day at Ascot, which has not fallen to a raider from his famous Ballydoyle yard since the Vincent O’Brien-trained Sir Ivor in 1968. Magical (4.00) can be the horse to end that barren run.While she has a couple of Group One victories to her name, this filly would have won four more, had it not been for Enable and Crystal Ocean. No rival of that standing faces her here. This is her ninth run of the year, so she will need to be durable but the best effort of her 2018 campaign came in November. 1.35 Ascot This will be the softest ground Advertise has encountered by a long way and promises to be significantly more testing even than the Haydock ground through which Hello Youmzain ploughed so effectively last month. Mabs Cross seemed to cope well with the mud at Longchamp, when she did best of those drawn away from the rail. All year, she has been running as though this extra furlong would be a big help and 33-1 could be a very big price about a mare with masses of top-class experience.2.10 Ascot The exceptional Straarius looks set for his 11th consecutive win, none of his rivals here posing an obvious threat. He might have got fed up on hock-deep ground but the switch to the drier inner track has removed even that potential trapdoor.2.45 Ascot Star Catcher will be hard to beat if Frankie Dettori is once more allowed his own way in front but that can’t be taken for granted against 11 rivals with a big prize on the line. Delphinia appeals as an alternative, having made steady progress all season. She impressed in staying on bravely for second place at Longchamp’s Arc meeting, despite interference.3.20 Ascot It is easy to like the power-packed finishes produced by The Revenant this year and this ground should be no problem to the French raider but the value of his form is open to question. The way is open for an outsider like Happy Power to get involved. He has seemed to relish the chances he has had on soft ground and, on a fast surface, was beaten less than two lengths in the Sussex Stakes. The grey has sometimes pulled too hard early on but there should be a decent pace on here.4.40 Ascot A 12lb rise for winning the Cambridgeshire makes this tough for Lord North but the way he shot forwards once in the clear that day suggests he really does belong in a higher grade and he can end the day on a high for the powerful GosdenDettori team.

Toomua made all the difference when he came on against Wales, and he’s already showing signs of a similar impact here. He has plenty of options from this scrum, with Petaia standing at 12 and Kerevi pushed out one to outside centre. England’s defence best have their eyes up.56 mins. Itoje does a great job of discrupting the Aus throw and thwarting the catch and drive, but the Wallanbies still have it and are working phases in the England 22 with Toomua now orchestrating. Another penalty to Australia as Underhill goes off his feet in the 22 and they take the scrum in the shadow of the posts.53 mins.  Rory Arnold nicks England’s lineout and Australia are in the England half, on the attack and in receipt of a penalty for Henry Slade not rolling away. They put it in the corner.51 mins.  Lealiifano is coming apart at the seams here as he follows up that poor pass with not making the 10 metres with the kick off. The ball is eventually out for an England lineout.Cheika has had enough and Toomua is on for the Lealiifano.The England captain adds three from in front, 25 metres out.48 mins. England hold up Sio in defence after the prop is given a pretty impossible task by a dodgy pass from Lealiifano and they win the scrum. They double down on this by splintering the Wallaby eight and winning a penalty. Farrell indicates sticks.46 mins. Watson makes some headway up the right and when the ball is recycled left Sinckler runs a fabulous out to in line in midfield, and he is through and in from 15 metres. He even deliberately ran at Beale to bump him, just to make some sort of point.43 mins. Daly drops a straightforward catch, and Australia are back on the attack. Slade pushes up too far in defence and the ball is floated over him and popped to Koroibete on the inside drift on halfway and he’s through and takes Daly to the cleaners by standing him up and going around him to score. Not a great few minutes for the England fullback.Game very much on.40 mins. It’s as you were with the line-ups as Owen Farrell get us back underwayThe death of the drop-goal is the greatest tactical tragedy in the history of any sport, Gary, let me tell you.Although, it has made something of a comeback this tournament after being persona non grata for at least a decade.It’s looking a realistic request at the moment, Phil.What to make of that half? Neither team look that decent without the ball, for a start. With the ball, England are more structured with more obvious patterns, while Australia are punching through the defensive line at will when they can keep hold of the ball, but they must exit their 22 better.The ball is off the field and now so are the teams.Lealiifano slots it as the gong goes, but there’s time for the restart.38 mins.  Austrlia have a scrum in the England 22. It goes down once and Sinckler believes Sio is dropping his bind and screams “Romain!” at touch judge Romain Poite 50 metres away on that side of the scrum to draw his attention. That level of cheeking of officials should bring a penalty, but Garces is traditionally weak on this and does nothing again.However, the next scrum brings the Aus penalty they should’ve had for that for England collapsing and Christian Lealiifano lines it up. 37 mins. Billy Vunipola, whose carrying has been significantly less effective than usual, is given the Hooper treatment at the breakdown and gives away a penalty. From the line-out Kerevi gets on the hoof and is through Tuilagi. Once again, the Wallabies are dangerous when they play in the right parts of the field.35 mins. Farrell turns Koroibete with a kick into the corner, and the Wallabies again try to run it from deep via Beale. It goes nowhere after four phases and they clear their lines not very far up the field.If Australia are going to keep doing that then England would be advised to keep letting them.33 mins. Possession is turned over to England again who kick for territory. Reece Hodge decides to have a run back and is absolutely powdered by a thundering hit by Sam Underhill. The ball was lost in the aftermath and England have a scrum just inside Australia’s half.32 mins. England gather the restart and allow Ben Youngs to do the necessary to touch and Australia chuck a huge ballooning throw over the top of the lineout. It was deliberate and is gathered to put them back on the attack just outside the England 22. 29 mins.  Tuilagi gets some momentum on a carry and Christian Lealiifano gives away a kickable penalty for not rolling away. Owen Farrell can stroke the likes of that over all day.27 mins. Beale launches a disgusting kick across his own 22 that puts England on the attack, but the spew the ball again to allow Australia to try and play out from their 22 again, but then they drop it and are accidentally offside. England scrum. Easy as that for the Wallaby ten.26 mins. Wallabies grab the lineout and send their midfield runners at the England line, Izack Rodda punches a bit hole through and when it’s recycled Jamie George is pinged for offside and Christian Lealiifano has the simplest of kicks. 24 mins. Australia have a lineout deep in England’s 2221 mins. Australia have, on the whole, started really well, but they’ve conceded two tries. However they don’t need to panic as it’s early and England don’t look comfortable against their attack at all.20 mins. Genia throws an interception to Slade and he’s away, but he doesn’t have the pace to get there from 70 metres so he dinks a beautiful kick on the run for May to gather and he definitely has the pace to get in.Farrell kicks another one from out left.18 mins. England have the ball back and there’s more fast soft hands right to Watson, it’s recycled and goes all the way left, some clever dummy runs in midfield hold the Aus defensive line and May crosses in the left corner.Farrell slots a great kick from the touchline.15 mins. England get the ball out and run a nice pattern out right to Watson who nearly gets away but is scragged, it goes all the way left and England are laying siege to the line before Pocock \u0026amp Hooper get in and nick it at the breakdown. First defensive test passed by Australia.13 mins.  Australia take the restart and try to run it from their own 22 via Allan Alaalatoa, who knocks on to give England a magnificent scrum position if - and it’s a big if based on what happened so far - they can actually get a scrum completed. And the Wallaby ten slots it. England need some ball very soon.11 mins. Slade’s first contribution is to have the ball bumped off him in the tackle, Beale receives it and is through the gap and runs 60 metres up to the England 22, but he’s gone so far that there’s no support with him. Not that it matters as England have given a penalty away that Christian Lealiifano is lining up. 8 mins. Jordan Petaia has had the ball in hand three times already and has looked quite the handful each time, carrying strongly and has just done a sweet offload to Kerevi. England now have a chance to play with the ball for first time off a lineout.6 mins. After four minutes of trying not a single scrum has been completed as England now get a free kick, which Farrell punts into touch in the Australia half.4 mins. Well, the upshot is Kyle Sinckler is pinged for early engagement and Australia take the scrum in the England 22 on the right. Great platform this if we can actually get a scrum completed, which looks beyond the wit of the teams at the moment.3 mins. First scrum of the game to see if the much vaunted England pack will have the nudge everyone expects.2 mins. Australia’s tackle line was flying up there and now on attack they are all fast hands and mobility for ten phases and into the England 22. They are very much up for this before the ball is spilled for an England scrum.Reece Hodge gets us underway and Daly gives Vunipola his first carry before the ball is booted back to Australia.Lots of singing from the stands for the England anthem, which suggest a more balanced fan presence than expected. Australia match it and we’re very nearly there.Here come the teams...England are wearing tracksuit tops and Australia are not. What could this mean? Nothing, Lee, calm down.Lawrence Dallaglio on the TV has a three-button blazer on. I had no idea you could still get those, they are more 1990s than overrated guitar bands. “Watching in the great city of New York,” says Jimmy Nutt, “where 16 years ago I watched the same teams play in the final of RWC”I watched that final in the great city of Cardiff. Very different vibe there, I have to say.Ten minutes until we get under way in the knock out stages. Imagine, for a second, that England, Ireland, Wales and Japan get through to the semis.Savour that thought, then dismiss it from your mind, for that way madness lies.“Why oh why oh why do these kinds of occasions fill us England fans with trepidation and anxiety?” asks James Acton, “There’s something about Australia and they always ‘have one game’ in them and it’s usually against us”Imagine being a Wales fan facing an Australia game for a decade up to last year, James, that’s real anxiety right there.“Dread is the feeling, as I cycle to Notting hill from Peckham,” says Ollie “my dad is an antique dealer so he has to be at the market, as he was the morning Jonny dropped us to glory in ‘03. This WC he’s not missing it so is bunking off to watch.”Ah, good old English dread and good old English bunking off. A perfect cocktail.“Bacon butties and coffee on the go.” Neil Stockton informs us, “Sofa screwed to the wall to avoid the temptation of ing behind it. Expecting 80 minutes of high anxiety. Come on England!”Very good choice on the breakfast and a wise choice on the sofa, not just to avoid taking cover behind it, but also to remove the risk of launching it across the room if it doesn’t pan out as you would want. “Just back from the bottle shop and have realised with abject horror that Becks beer has lowered the alcohol content and it tastes terrible! Not a good start to a game I fully expect England to thump us in.”I get the impression there’s not a great deal of Aussie confidence about, and this is another example. Also, Becks has always tasted awful, Martin, whatever the alcohol content.  “Not edgey at all,” says a relaxed Nick Woof, “full of confidence for an England win”I genuinely cannot grasp how any fans, other than Kiwis, can have confidence about any big game.How is everyone feeling out there?Why not let me and the readers know by dropping me an mail here, a tweet here, or send a carrier pigeon to Lee, The North.Don’t have a go at me for making such insinuations, Michael Hooper himself has admitted as much here.Billy Vunipola is back in the England team and has been telling Rob Kitson what the necessary is for today:Eddie Jones has made what are considered to be some big calls with George Ford and Joe Marler both relegated to the bench after being in from the start and bang in form since the warm-ups. Owen Farrell is back to out-half, Tuilagi shuffles in one position to 12 and Henry Slade is back at 13 - a position in which he hasn’t started an international match since the Six Nations brilliant farce vs Scotland. Jones is clearly worried about the carrying of Kerevi and didn’t fancy the big Wallaby centre careering down Ford’s channel like a thermonuclear traction engine in the first half - best to remove the Leicester man and save him and his body for later. That’s probably part of it, but my reckoning is that Eddie is as concerned about what young Petaia, Beale joining the line from fullback and Koroibete may do wider out. Tuilagi has many (often brutal) strengths, but defending the 13 channel against an attack as inventive and mobile as Australia’s is not one of them. Slade, with his extra pace both in his feet and head, is tailor-made for such a job.It has not escaped notice that Jones’s forward selection is largely a repeat of the victory in Dublin back in January, when the England pack ground Ireland to a fine paste in tight and in the carry, kicked from hand beautifully and had the game pretty much won after 65 mins. Expect the same approach here.Michael Cheika has seen his side not exactly fire in the tournament yet, but unlike England the Wallabies do have a proper hit out vs Wales under their belt. It was a loss, sure, but they can look at the game and believe there was enough there to know they could have won it, and that they roared back after a poor start. They must not allow such a start here, given England’s bench contains all spoiling forwards then the men in gold are ill advised to be behind by a few with 20 minutes to go. I don’t fancy them getting enough ball - or certainly enough good ball - to come back, so Cheika’s focus must be on being ahead at the half and if they put pressure on the sometimes flaky kicking of Ben Youngs, that could be the key to it all.Hello and welcome to this first Rugby World Cup quarter final from Oita.The late, great cycling commentator, David Duffield, was known for his one-liners that could be mangled, daft, cryptic or perfect - often at the same time. My personal favourite was one he used as things became more tense than was comfortable, “It’s turn your granny to the wall time!” On the face of it this means nothing, and yet every fan in white or gold joining us here will know how exactly what that feeling is all about: it’s knock-out rugby, it’s England vs Australia and - like Disney World or a chicken vindaloo - it’s equal parts exhilarating and excruciating.England have beaten the Wallabies in their six most recent meetings, including an historic whitewash series down under in 2016. However, Australia will remember that their last victory was not only in a Rugby World Cup, it was the absolute hiding at Twickenham that machine-gunned the nails into the coffin that England were carried out of their own tournament in.The intensity on the pitch will likely pale in comparison to the plethora of coach-cam shots of raging foul mouthed outbursts from Cheika \u0026amp Jones throughout. The fans with a vested interest will try to enjoy it as best they can through the juddering cluster-nausea of nerves, while “neutrals” struggle to decide which one of these coaches they wish to see the back of least.Settle yourselves in, it’s going to be emotional."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/467898f2a9b4d32ae177dc8636ab4b35ccb8f2eb/27_0_3445_2068/master/3445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1309a047a884af984f56730fda20903f","title":"how the wheels came off facebook libra project","story":"Support for Mark Zuckerberg’s mission to reshape global finance is slipping away slowly but surely When Facebook announced plans to launch a digital currency earlier this summer, it added a full-blown revolution in global finance to its typically vaulting Silicon Valley mission statement: to create a digital currency alongside its efforts to bring the world closer together through networks.Over the past month, that mission has gone badly awry. The Libra cryptocurrency project now faces existential threats from world leaders and central bankers worried about its harmful potential: as a vehicle for money laundering, a threat to global financial stability, open to data privacy abuse, dangerous for consumers and stripping nations of the control of their economies by privatising the money supply.Seven high-profile partners in the Facebook-led consortium that is building the digital currency – known as the Libra Association – have quit in dramatic fashion in recent weeks, including PayPal, eBay, Visa and Mastercard, as concerns mount.“One by one they’re starting to drop away. That’s certainly not good news,” said John Sedunov, a professor of finance and expert in cryptocurrencies at Villanova University.“I’m not saying that it’s tearing apart at the seams totally, but we’re starting to inch towards the cliff. The fewer financial firms and fewer mainstream companies in this project, the more it loses credibility,” he added.In the latest blow to the project, the G7 group of the world’s most powerful nations warned on Friday that digital currencies such as Libra “pose challenges for competition and antitrust policies” and should not be allowed to launch until the regulatory concerns are addressed.Mark Zuckerberg is expected to feel the pressure mount further next week when he heads for a grilling at the US House of Representatives over Libra. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he will face sharp questions over data privacy. To add to fears over Facebook’s control of personal information, building a digital currency brings sensitive financial data into its orbit, raising the stakes.“I get the sense that they’ll get hit harder on those areas for Libra. And I don’t think Zuckerberg is the politicians’ favourite person. That comes into play,” said Sedunov.As the problems for Libra mount, comments made this week by the Labour MP Alison McGovern could prove instructive to preview the showdown in Washington: “Isn’t it a legitimate question of policymakers to ask Facebook: ‘Why are you bothering? Why is this for you?’”Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, told McGovern and other MPs on the Commons Treasury committee that Libra should be heavily regulated worldwide “or it’s not going to happen”.“This will not be like social media. This will not be a case where something gets up and starts running and then the system tries to figure out after the fact how it’s going to regulate it,” he said.Threadneedle Street insiders believe Libra was probably planned with too many technologists and too few economists to think about its risks to the world economy. With 2 billion Facebook users, Libra could become systemically important for the global financial system overnight. In a clash of worlds between technology and finance, the fail-fast-and-improve Silicon Valley approach is incompatible with a too-big-to-fail financial project.Dante Disparte, the head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, dismissed the concerns, adding: “We agree that the Libra project should be appropriately regulated, so calls for regulation are not a ‘setback’ or ‘blow’ to the project. Responsible financial innovation and regulatory oversight are not in contest.”However, governments and central banks around the world are worried they could lose control of their monetary policy if significant chunks of activity shift to Libra.Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, warned in the Financial Times this week that Libra posed a threat to national sovereignty. He argued that even regulation would not be enough to address the risks posed, “because Libra is asking states to share their monetary sovereignty with private companies”. Le Maire wrote that he “cannot countenance” passing control of a key tool for steering the economy from democratically elected governments and their central banks to a group with explicitly commercial interests.Andrew Milligan, the head of global strategy at the fund manager Aberdeen Standard, said: “With digital money created by corporations, we therefore have to transfer our trust to corporations. That’s different from trusting a traditional bank and the governments that back deposits in them.”Despite the existential threat to its future, Libra still draws support for its potential to revolutionise finance – if it can satisfy central bankers over their concerns.Financial exclusion around the globe could be tackled by a company with Facebook’s presence in developing countries, while the promise of digital currency has potential to cut the cost of notoriously expensive cross-border payments, saving households and businesses money and time.However, with mounting regulatory pressures, the time and cost of building Libra to settle those concerns could quickly spiral. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that Libra would need to meet similar standards to traditional banks. Building a payment system to meet the myriad of bank regulations could rapidly erode the high-tech competitive advantages that would make Libra quicker and cheaper.Teunis Brosens, the lead economist for digital finance regulation at the Dutch bank ING, said: “The financial sector is the most heavily regulated sector of all and I think they underestimated that.”However, big banks have long feared competition from internet giants. And in the shape of Facebook, they have a rival with deep pockets. Brosens added: “It really could go both ways. I find it a bit too easy to say with schadenfreude that Facebook has launched this thing and they fell flat on their face.“They made a big play and now they face a substantial setback. But they can still recover. I don’t expect Facebook to give up this easily.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18b9f404b5b419f21e2fbf126c03de54efd55c3/0_105_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17a5da337a3a8fbad0e113bbd9951d8","title":"just dont waste david attenborough advice bbc seven worlds one planet","story":"At launch of BBC nature series Seven Worlds, One Planet, Attenborough says message is finally getting throughDavid Attenborough has delivered a heartfelt message to children around the world on how they can help save the planet: “Live the way you want to live but just don’t waste.”At the first screening of the BBC’s forthcoming blockbuster nature series, Seven Worlds, One Planet, the 93-year-old offered his advice to a five-year-old in the London audience. The boy was overwhelmed by nerves when handed the microphone, so his father asked his question on his behalf: “What can he do to save the planet?”“You can do more and more and more the longer you live, but the best motto to think about is not waste things,” Attenborough replied. “Don’t waste electricity, don’t waste paper, don’t waste food. Live the way you want to live but just don’t waste. Look after the natural world, and the animals in it, and the plants in it too. This is their planet as well as ours. Don’t waste them.”A rapt audience of children in India and South Africa joined the event by videolink and lined up to ask Attenborough questions and wave posters. At Mumbai’s packed Royal Opera House, placards read “Sir David please come to India please” and “Sir David can I please come on a shoot with you?”One asked Attenborough which animal he had found most difficult to document during his 70-year career. “I nominate going to look for mountain gorillas for the first time,” he said. “That was an unforgettable time and more successful than we could possibly have hoped … but it was a long time ago.”Asked what was the greatest treat in store for viewers in the new series, Attenborough said: “There’s a wonderful creature called the golden-haired blue-faced snub-nosed snow monkey. I’d never seen film of it before. I once read a scientific paper and thought: we must go and film that! But that was back in the 60s and we couldn’t get to China so in the end I dropped it … and then, blow me, this lot pop up and say ‘we’ve got it’.”Jonny Keeling, the series’ executive producer, described his excitement at showing Attenborough never-before-seen footage of the monkey, only for him to nonchalantly reply: “Ah yes, Rhinopithecus roxellana!”Tony Hall, the director general of the BBC, said: “There has never been a more important time to bring natural wonders to everybody.” He confirmed the BBC’s commitment to air a landmark nature series every year until 2023. “No other broadcaster comes close to that kind of commitment to the natural world.”The BBC’s Natural History Unit has faced criticism for what some see as a reticence in spelling out how humans are damaging the natural world. This year, Attenborough’s move to Netflix for Our Planet – which made its message explicit throughout – was hailed as his first act as an “in-yer-face eco-warrior” and many felt it stole the BBC’s thunder.Attenborough rejects such criticism, saying both he and the broadcaster had long been conscious of the climate crisis. “I don’t think I’ve made a series in the last 40 years where I haven’t made at the end an appeal about caring for the natural world,” he said.“At the time I daresay people thought we were cranks, but as it’s gone on and we’ve repeated it on and on and on – not wasting things, not polluting things, and so on. Suddenly, for no reason I can understand because the message has been the same, you hit the right note.”It was with Blue Planet II, he said, that the world became “electrified” about the crime of dumping plastic into the ocean. “Quite what it is that makes the messages ring the bell is very difficult to say. I daresay if we knew how to do it, we would do it more frequently.”• Seven Worlds, One Planet starts on BBC One on Sunday 27 October at 6.15pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2d1c12eb585c616b1ec52172a45ba85d0d92a11/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13ba8941ef04843eb445f9e347d22a82","title":"clinton emails investigation ends state department","story":"State department did find violations by 38 current and former department officials, some of whom may face disciplinary actionThe state department has completed its years-long internal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email and found “no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information”.The investigation, launched more than three years ago, did find violations by 38 people, some of whom may face disciplinary action.Investigators determined that those 38 people were “culpable” in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton’s personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican senator Chuck Grassley this week and released on Friday. The 38 are current and former state department officials but were not identified.While there were no findings of deliberate mishandling of classified information, the report made clear that Clinton’s use of the private email while serving as the secretary of state in the Obama administration had increased the vulnerability of classified information.The Associated Press sent an email seeking comment to a Clinton representative.The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases.For current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be.The report concluded “that the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of state department networks”.The department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton’s private server to be “top secret”. Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and Trump made the server a major focus of his campaign.James Comey, the then-FBI director, held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as “extremely careless” in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges.The justice department’s inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt “fairly confident that there wasn’t an intrusion”.Grassley started investigating Clinton’s email server in 2017, when he was the chair of the Senate judiciary committee. The Iowa Republican has been critical of Clinton’s handling of classified information and urged administrative sanctions.Clinton has frequently lampooned the Republicans’ ongoing obsession with her email controversy (“lock her up” is still a popular chant at Trump rallies). An exhibit at the Venice Biennale in September saw her sitting behind a replica of the Oval Office’s Resolute Desk and reading from the 62,000 pages of emails."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f46922dcd1de8c36ec7afa685553e147a34c7d/0_431_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca83b9f6b4d4ee0140b9692512467404","title":"eu refusal to open talks with albania and north macedonia condemned as historic mistake","story":"Juncker says failure of EU to keep its promises was ‘major historic mistake’Leaders of the EU institutions have condemned the bloc’s refusal to open membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania as a “historic mistake”.In a blow to pro-EU politicians in the small Balkan states, EU government leaders missed a deadline to approve the launch of talks.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said it was a “major historic mistake”, adding: “If we want to be respected, we have to keep our promises.”Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, described the impasse as a mistake. “It is not a failure, it is a mistake. I feel really embarrassed,” he told journalists at the end of a two-day summit in Brussels. “Both countries, they passed their exams I can’t say this about our member states.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, led opposition to opening membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania, putting him at odds with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who has championed the EU hopes of six Balkan states.Denmark and the Netherlands also blocked the decision, although were open to considering the two countries separately. Both opposed opening talks with Albania, but suggested North Macedonia could get a green light by passing a law to safeguard the future of an independent public prosecutor.Balkan states began their long journey to EU membership at a summit in Thessaloniki in 2003 when optimism after the end of the cold war was still high.North Macedonia’s foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, suggested the EU was being dishonest. “The least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us,” he tweeted. “If there is no more consensus on the European future of the western Balkans, if the promise of Thessaloniki 2003 does not stand, the citizens deserve to know.”North Macedonia had been led to believe the path to EU membership would be opened after it resolved a three-decade-long dispute over its name. The former Yugoslav Republic became North Macedonia in February after a historic agreement with Greece, which had blocked Skopje’s Nato and EU ambitions over the dispute.Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, said the decision was “linked with an open confrontation within the EU itself”, on its enlargement process. He vowed to continue domestic reforms “not because Paris, Berlin, Brussels or all of them are asking for it, but because it is needed to turn our country into a European, functional one”, Associated Press in Tirana reported.EU leaders had promised in June to take “a clear and substantive decision as soon as possible and no later than October 2019”.Shortly before a ministerial decision was due this week, France announced it wanted to reform the EU’s enlargement process. The last-minute decision was greeted with scepticism by EU diplomats supporting enlargement, who suspected a ruse to delay a decision.The French government has said it supports the “European perspective” of the western Balkan countries, but argues the current process is not credible.Democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, fatigue after the Greek eurozone crisis, as well as a widespread view that Romania and Bulgaria were let into the EU too soon, has contributed to doubts about EU expansion in some of the club’s older members."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4055556.1571424233!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"many no deal plans to be stood down if deal approved varadkar says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar arrives for the second day of a two-day summit of European Union leaders in Brussels on Friday. Photograph: Sean GallupGetty Images The Taoiseach moved to reassure unionists about the constitutional implications of the new Brexit deal, telling journalists at the conclusion of the European Union summit in Brussels that “people will still post letters in Royal Mail red letterboxes”.However, his overtures were rejected by the DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who said Mr Varadkar was “either very ill-informed or else just wishes to be offensive”.Mr Varadkar said: “The queen will still be the queen, the pound will still be the pound , people will still post letters in Royal Mail red letterboxes.DifferencesMr Varadkar said that there were already differences between the North and the rest of the UK, which did not affect its constitutional position.“It’s been the case for 100 years now that Northern Ireland has its own legal system, has a different education system, has lots of different laws, lots of different rules from the rest of the UK,” he said.“And that’s a reflection of devolution and autonomy and doesn’t change the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.”Mr Varadkar also said many of the Government’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit would be stood down if the House of Commons votes to approve the new agreement on Saturday.“If the House of Commons does vote yes on the indicative vote on Saturday, that will put us in a position to stand down no-deal preparations,” he said.“But we won’t stop them entirely. Because there is always an outside chance of something going wrong over the next couple of weeks. Because as I understand it, what’s required as well is legislation, the withdrawal Act, as well as an indicative vote.”‘Confident’Mr Varadkar said he was “confident” that Stormont would not vote to leave the special arrangements agreed in the new deal and precipitate a hardening of the Border.“If there is a risk we are taking, the risk we are taking is one on democracy and saying to the people of Northern Ireland that you determine your future and that is something I can stand over,” he said.Mr Varadkar also said that it had “crossed my mind” that he might be put under pressure by EU leaders to compromise on the backstop but he said he learned “this was a concern that we did not need to have”.Mr Varadkar also warned that MPs should not assume there would be an extension if they vote to reject the deal today.While Ireland would be favourable towards any request for a further extension, Mr Varadkar said: “Our point of view has always been that we would be open to it, but it would be a mistake to assume that it’s a guarantee, given that it requires unanimity by all 27 member states.”He said the revised withdrawal agreement was unlikely to be revisited further, and the choice was between this agreement and no deal.“Plan B is no deal, and we’re all preparing for that, and we’ve all been preparing for that since the referendum, but let’s hope that doesn’t happen,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Tom Honan for The Fine Gael’s Fergus O’Dowd was plastered in Leinster House this week. It had nothing to do with the Dáil bar.The TD for Louth became the first casualty of the non-election election campaign on Monday evening when he took a bad tumble while doing the doorsteps in Drogheda and broke a bone in his leg.The Chairman of the Oireachtas Transport Committee slipped on wet grass when taking a short cut across a sloping green area in the Five Oaks Village estate and ended up flat on his back in considerable pain.“I was lucky it wasn’t dark because I landed in a hollow where it wouldn’t have been so easy to spot me,” he told us. “I couldn’t get up off the ground and I had to shout out for help.”A party colleague on the same leafleting mission came to his rescue and drove him to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. Fergus was back in business by Wednesday, hobbling around on crutches with his lower leg in an impressive cast.“I broke my fibula – I had to Google it to find out where exactly that is. It’s a long, slender bone on one side of the tibia. The good news is it’s a very clean break.”He’ll be hoping the fevered Dáil speculation over a snap November general election doesn’t come to pass. Hitting a mid-winter campaign trail on crutches wouldn’t be easy, although it could work wonders on the sympathy vote front. “Did Maireád McGuinness push you?” was the most common reaction from fellow politicians when he hobbled by.It may be over 10 years since O’Dowd fought off a strong challenge from his constituency running-mate in the 2007 general election, but memories of their monumental battle still linger. MEP Maireád, of course, has since gone on to greater things in Europe.Despite his infirmity, Fergus made it out to RTÉ on Wednesday night for Katie Hannon’s Late Debate. There was some joking in the studio beforehand about whether the Fine Gael TD was going to “make a claim”. The show’s producer, Brian Lally, tweeted that “not even crutches would keep Fergus O’Dowd” away from the discussion.Among the TDs who liked the tweet was Fergus’s Fine Gael colleague, Alan Farrell, a TD most definitely of the view that making claims is no laughing matter.Irish media should be nicer to Trump – or else he’ll stop reading usFergus’s younger brother Niall O’Dowd, the New York-based publisher and journalist, draws attention in irishcentral this week to an interview in a new book by RTÉ news anchor Caitríona Perry with the man who was Donald Trump’s first choice for US ambassador to Ireland.Trump supporter Brian Burns (82), an Irish-American lawyer and philanthropist, had to turn down the job for health reasons. But he still takes a keen interest in how America’s commander-in-chief is perceived back in the ancestral homeland (his grandparents emigrated from Kerry in the 1800s).In his opinion, we aren’t half as nice to Donald as we should be. He told Perry, a former Washington correspondent, that his good friend and neighbour in Florida is misunderstood by people in Ireland and doesn’t deserve the bad press he gets.Trump’s affection for Ireland is as great as that of Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan or JFK, he argues. “He loves Ireland.” Unfortunately, “terrible articles” are written about Trump in the Irish papers, says Burns, before revealing this bombshell about his president: “He looks” at these awful write-ups too. Sad. Who’d have thought it?What with all that tweeting and the golf and selling hotel rooms in Miami to G7 Summit delegations and dashing off stern letters to authoritarian leaders, how on earth does he manage to find the time to read the Irish papers? We must be nicer to the Donald.“He’s the first president that owns lots of land and has some hopes and dreams for Ireland, and you find him a really great friend of Ireland. But, sometimes, perhaps Ireland could reach its hand out too.”Right enough, Donald is very good at reaching out the hand. As Brian Burns pleads in his defence: “He hasn’t done anything to Ireland! Ireland’s great . . . They ought to accept this guy.”Urgent note to Fintan and all the other Irish media ingrates. Stop writing nasty stuff about the President of the United States of America.

As You-Know-Who might say.Caitríona Perry’s The Tribe: The Inside Story of Irish Power and Influence in US Politics is in the shops now.Musical Madigan’s trumpet-blowing masterclassThe Minister for Culture, who has the National Symphony Orchestra in her remit, is no slouch in the brass section.She’s a veritable virtuoso on the trumpet. Josepha Madigan’s Family Law Bill passed through the Dáil on Wednesday evening – an achievement of which she is justly proud.She introduced a Private Members’ Bill in 2016 proposing a change in the law to reduce the length of time spouses need to live apart before they can apply for a orce. A referendum in May paved the way for Parliament to legislate on the issue.She was due to make a closing speech at the end of the second stage hearing. It was emailed in advance to journalists along with a helpful cover note “highlighting the key lines from the speech”.The really important parts of these key lines were further highlighted. There wasn’t much about the legislation. No. These were the really, really standout points from the already extracted key lines.“I regard the passing of the referendum and legislating for this Family Law Bill as a huge personal achievement.” And “huge personal achievement” was underlined and italicised.Also not to be missed was “Ceann Comhairle, to close the second stage of the Family Law Bill 2019 in this house today and to shortly see it enshrined in law is very humbling moment for me”.\u0026nbspThe very humbling moment was also picked out and underscored, just in case we missed it.“I am pleased to have instigated this social reform in our country” was left to its own devices, but “It represents not just a significant achievement in my own career to date but also for new politics” got the special treatment. And then the last key line.“In a world where politics can be viewed with cynicism, it shows that one person really can make a difference.” The last bit about “one person” etc was isolated for special notice.When the debate happened, Josepha was late. She rushed into the chamber as the presiding Minister of State, John Stanton, was officially wrapping up proceedings. Breathless, she pleaded with the Leas Cheann Comhairle for time to speak. The TDs present agreed to allow her say her piece as it was her legislation. There wasn’t no time for the speech, but at least the Minister managed to say thank you to everyone involved and deliver those really important “huge personal achievement” key lines for posterity.

You’ll need super powersOne of the most prestigious and important jobs in Leinster House is the role of superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The “super” is effectively the estate manager, the person who runs the show.Following the departure of ex-army man Paul Conway to a new job with the European Parliament in Brussels, the post is up for grabs. Notice of an open competition for the role went up on Wednesday and there is huge interest in who will get the nod.Nothing happens in Leinster House without the super knowing about it. He (for it has always been a man up until now) is responsible for the smooth running of the Oireachtas, with particular emphasis on security.According to the very lengthy job spec, the superintendent and their unit’s primary function “is to maintain security and decorum in the parliamentary chambers and across the Leinster House complex, ensuring that a secure and safe work environment is provided for Members, their staff and the staff of the service.“The unit must also ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas is a secure, safe and welcoming place for visitors as ‘a Parliament which works for the people’. The superintendent has overall responsibility for the infrastructure and accommodation needs of the Houses of the Oireachtas and for Members’ and staff accommodation.”The Taoiseach has absolute discretion on whether or not to appoint a candidate from the competition after consultation with the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and the members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.The super has a special support unit comprising the ushers team of 64 staff, 18 service offices and a small team of attendants and porters. Needless to say, the ever-obliging ushers have a very special interest in who gets the job.The job brief places emphasis on the successful applicant having a “critical role in driving organisation change and motivating staff” in a “modern parliamentary service”. Some of the rules and conventions currently in existence belong to another, more stuffy and fussy pre-digital era and they could do a modern makeover. The closing date for applications is Monday November 4th.Varadkar tries to flush out the unionists in the HouseOn Wednesday, the Taoiseach was musing on Richard Boyd Barrett’s assertion that politics in Northern Ireland should not be defined along simply nationalist or unionist lines.“I still can’t work out whether People Before Profit is nationalist, unionist or ‘other’,” Leo Varadkar remarked.“We are other. We declare as other,” responded Richard.“You are absolutely right, you are one of the three parties that are designated as ‘other’ – Alliance Party, the Green Party and PBP – and they do so on the basis that they reject sectarianism, which I think is a good thing and I do want to acknowledge that.”Then he said PBP campaigned for Brexit, which is a unionist thing to do. Richard said they didn’t.“Well, you at least advocated Brexit, which is regrettable. I do know that there’s some in the radical left family in Ireland who actually advocate a socialist federation of England, Scotland and Ireland.”“I don’t think it’s People Before Profit, I think that’s Solidarity, but we do have unionists in this House, which is interesting, an interesting position, and not the ones you might think.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4056523.1571464794!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chile declares emergency as capital rocked by riots","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Chilean Police detain a protester at the Los Heroes metro station in the middle of a demonstration, in Santiago, Chile. Photograph: Alberto PenaEPAChile’s president Sebastian Pinera has declared a state of emergency in the capital Santiago, as the city of 6 million descended into chaos amid riots that left a downtown building engulfed in flames and its metro system shuttered.Black-hooded protesters enraged by recent fare hikes on public transportation lit fires at several metro stations, looted shops, burned a public bus and swung metal pipes at train station turnstiles during Friday’s afternoon commute, according to witnesses, social media and television footage.Mr Pinera spoke to the nation in the early hours of Saturday, declaring an emergency lockdown as sirens filled the night air downtown, and police and firefighters rushed to contain the damage.The centre-right Pinera said he would invoke a special state security law to prosecute the “criminals” responsible for the city-wide damage, while at the same time saying he sympathized with those impacted by the rate hikes.“In the coming days, our government will call for a dialogue ... to alleviate the suffering of those affected by the increase in fares,” Pinera said in the broadcast address.FlashpointChile is one of Latin America’s wealthiest nations, but also, among its most unequal. Frustrations over the high cost of living in Santiago have become a political flashpoint, prompting calls for reforms on everything from the country’s tax and labour codes to its pension system.Enel Chile, a subsidiary of Italian utility Enel, said vandals had set fire to the company’s high-rise corporate headquarters downtown. Local television footage showed flames climbing up the side of the building as fire crews struggled to break through growing crowds of protesters.The company said in a statement posted on Twitter that workers had been evacuated safely from the site.High school and university students began the protests after the government hiked fares on October 6th to as much as €1.05 ($1.17) for a peak metro ride, blaming higher energy costs and a weaker peso.The protests turned increasingly violent on Friday afternoon, however, and by early evening, officials had closed down all of the city’s 136 metro stations, which connect more than 87 miles of track.The metro system will remain closed through the weekend, with officials saying “serious destruction” made it impossible to operate trains safely.Demonstrators clanging pots and honking horns clashed with police armed with batons and tear gas all across the normally subdued city late into Friday evening. management said there had been more than 200 incidents on Santiago’s subway system in the previous 11 days, mostly involving school children and older students jumping barriers and forcing gates.Earlier on Friday, after a meeting with the metro chief and interior minister, Transport Minister Gloria Hutt told reporters the fare hike would not be reversed. She said the government subsidizes almost half the operating costs of the metro, one of Latin America’s most modern.“This is not a discussion that should have risen to the level of violence that we’ve seen,” she said. –Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4056533.1571474000!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit outcome expected to depend on a handful of votes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrime Minister Boris Johnson leaves Downing Street for the House of Commons to deliver a statement   on his new Brexit deal on Saturday morning. Photograph:  Victoria JonesPA Wire British Prime Minister Boris Johnson puts his last-minute Brexit deal to a vote in an extraordinary sitting of the British parliament on Saturday, a day of reckoning that could decide the course of the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union. More than three years since the United Kingdom voted 52-48 to be the first sovereign country to leave the European project, Mr Johnson will try to win parliament’s approval for the orce treaty he struck in Brussels on Thursday.In a day of Brexit high drama, lawmakers convene for the first Saturday sitting since the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falklands, while hundreds of thousands of people are due to march to parliament demanding another referendum.Mr Johnson depicted the vote in parliament as the last chance to secure an orderly Brexit. Though he is obliged by law to seek a Brexit delay if his deal falls, Mr Johnson said the United Kingdom would still leave on October 31st. He didn’t explain how.“There have been any number of false dawns. Deadlines for our departure have come and gone,” Mr Johnson, the face of the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, wrote in The Sun newspaper. “Today can be the day we get Brexit done.”The so-called “Super Saturday” Brexit extravaganza tops a frenetic week which saw Mr Johnson confound his opponents by clinching a new Brexit deal only to find his Northern Irish allies oppose the deal he struck.In a ided parliament where he has no majority and opponents are plotting maximum political damage ahead of an imminent election, Mr Johnson must now win the support of 320 lawmakers to pass his deal through a booby-trapped legislature.Handful of votesWith a number of hardline Brexiteers still undecided and a group of expelled Conservatives ided over how to vote, the outcome is expected to depend on a handful of votes.“I suppose what I would say to friends and colleagues in the House of Commons is: Look, you know, this has been a long, exhausting and quite isive business, Brexit,” the prime minister told the BBC on Friday night.“I think it’s a great agreement, it takes us forward and it gets us out of the backstop.”Early on Saturday morning, the ERG’s Bernard Jenkin appeared to confirm that he and the rest of the group would be backing the deal.He tweeted: “This deal is hundreds of miles from perfect. It has terrible elements, but we are where we are. At least BackBoris has substantially improved it and it now points in a far more positive direction for our country.”Former British prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major have warned that Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, which the DUP opposes, could upset the delicate balance in Northern Ireland put in place by the Belfast Agreement. In a joint video with Mr Blair for the People’s Vote campaign that advocates a second Brexit referendum, Mr Major said a border in the Irish Sea would fuel unionist fears.“It splits Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. And that, of course, always plays on the inherent fears of Northern Ireland, that they’re being ignored, that they’re being maltreated. And those fears are very real. And they need to be addressed and they need to be assuaged,” he said.Mr Johnson spent Friday trying to woo skeptical MPs in his own party as well as opposition Labour politicians who represent pro-Brexit districts. The result looks set to be too close to call, and Mr Johnson’s team believe they’re making progress, according to an official who declined to be named.“Imagine what it could be like tomorrow evening, if we have settled this, and we have respected the will of the people, because we will then have a chance to move on,” Mr Johnson said in an interview with BBC TV on Friday. “This has been a long, exhausting and quite isive business.”Mr Johnson received a boost from the EU when French President Emmanuel Macron said even if Parliament rejected the deal, there would be no further delay to Brexit day beyond the current deadline of October 31st.That added to the pressure on MPs who would prefer another extension to the deadline to leaving the EU without a deal.Sitting from 9.30amIf he wins the vote, Mr Johnson will go down in history as the leader who delivered a Brexit - for good or bad - that pulls the United Kingdom far out of the EU’s orbit.Should he fail, Mr Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unravelling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done - “do or die” - by October 31st.Parliament will sit from 9.30am on Saturday. Mr Johnson will make a statement to lawmakers, after which there will be a debate and then votes on amendments and finally - if all goes according to the government’s plan - his deal.To win the vote, though, Mr Johnson must persuade enough Brexit-supporting rebels in both his own Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party to back his deal. His Northern Irish allies and the three main opposition parties oppose it.In a boost for Mr Johnson, some influential hardline Brexit supporters such as Mark Francois and Iain Duncan Smith said they would support the deal.Yet Mr Johnson must navigate a legislative jungle that his opponents are trying to booby trap with amendments that could wreck his path to Brexit.AmendmentOne expelled Conservative lawmaker, Oliver Letwin, has proposed that the decision on whether to back a deal be deferred until all the legislation needed to implement the terms of the deal has been passed through parliament.This proposal, which has cross-party support and even Mr Johnson’s Northern Irish allies said they might back it, will be put to a vote at the end of Saturday’s debate if selected by Speaker John Bercow. If the amendment is approved by parliament, Mr Johnson’s deal would not then be put to a vote on Saturday.That would be a major setback that would leave Brexit, yet again, up in the air as hundreds of thousands of protesters rally outside the 800-year-old parliament in central London to demand another referendum.The Letwin move, aimed at preventing the United Kingdom from somehow dropping out of the EU without a deal, would in effect force Mr Johnson to delay Brexit until all the laws needed to leave have passed through parliament’s multi-stage approval process.Even though Mr Johnson believes this can be achieved by October 31st, others think it would need a short ‘technical’ delay.A law passed by Mr Johnson’s opponents obliges him to ask the EU for a Brexit delay until January 31st 2020 unless he has secured approval for his deal by the end of Saturday.“My aim is to ensure that Boris’s deal succeeds,” Mr Letwin said. “But that we have an insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation.”If Mr Johnson’s deal is rejected, there may also be a vote on whether to leave without a deal and also whether to hold another referendum. DUP to consider amendmentDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said on Saturday morning that the DUP would look at whether or not to back the Letwin amendment.“It is a very interesting amendment. We are going to look at that very closely, and examine it. It does have the merit of pointing out that this would withhold approval of the Commons from the Government’s plans. So, we haven’t made any final decision on that, we will meet later and discuss as a parliamentary group... tactics,” he said.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said however the Government wanted to block the Letwin amendment. Mr Barclay told the BBC: “It will add further delay, further dither, further uncertainty, which is bad for investment, bad for our economy.” In Brussels on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that although Ireland would be favourable towards any request, MPs should not assume there will be an extension if they vote to reject the deal today.“Our point of view has always been that we would be open to it, but it would be a mistake to assume that it’s a guarantee, given that it requires unanimity by all 27 member states.”The Taoiseach moved to reassure unionists about the constitutional implications of the new Brexit deal, saying at the conclusion of the EU summit in Brussels that “the queen will still be the queen, the pound will still be the pound , people will still post letters in Royal Mail red letterboxes”.Mr Varadkar said that he was “confident” Stormont would not vote to leave the special arrangements agreed in the new deal and precipitate a hardening of the Border.“If there is a risk we are taking, the risk we are taking is one on democracy and saying to the people of Northern Ireland that you determine your future and that is something I can stand over,” he said.Mr Dodds said: “If Leo Varadkar thinks unionism is just about red post boxes then he is either very ill-informed or else just wishes to be offensive.”He complained that “a new trade barrier will have been erected between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom without the consent of anyone who lives here”."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Under the Strictly Glitterball with Michelle Visage: \u0026#39You must take whatever joy you can in life.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las.

Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHThe film’s trailer features a gospel reinterpretation\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspWest’s track “Say You Will”, from his 2008 album 808s \u0026amp Heartbreak, over an image of what appears to be a temple.It ends with a biblical quote from the New Testament Book of Mark that reads: “In the words of Jesus Christ, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe in the gospel.’”Everything you need to know about the Jesus is King screenings can be found below.Is Kanye West trolling us all from on high?When is Jesus is King being screened in the UK?Jesus is King is screening in IMAX cinemas across the UK from the 25 October to the 28 October.A full list of cinemas across the UK that will show the film can be found at West’s official website here.Cities include London, Leeds, Manchester, Cardiff, Birmingham and Milton Keynes.Where can I buy tickets?Tickets can be found via the official sites of your local IMAX cinema if it’s screening the film, or via West’s official website here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The mysterious, so-called \u0027Lausanne\u0027 Sunflowers – the first Arles Sunflowers painting – with turquoise background. It was created in the summer of 1886 at Van Gogh\u0027s studio at Arles, north of Marseille in Provence. It has not been show to the public since 1948. 1889, oil on canvas. This painting depicts the view from the window of Van Gogh\u0027s asylum room of Saint-Remy-de-Provence. It is one of the most recognised paintings in the history of Western culture.1889, oil on canvas. The most recognised of several iris paintings made by Van Gogh at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum, in the last year before his death in 1890. 1889, oil on canvas. Van Gogh painted over 43 self-portraits, paintings and drawings over a period of 10 years. He wrote to his sister: \u0027I am looking for a deeper likeness than that obtained by a photographer\u0027 and to his brother: \u0027People say, and I am willing to believe it, that it is hard to know yourself. But it is not easy to paint yourself either. The portraits painted by Rembrandt are more like a revelation.\u0027Oil on canvas, 1890. This painting was completed in early May, when Van Gogh was suffering a severe relapse of poor health – two months before his death. It is based on a pencil drawing, \u0027Worn Out\u0027, from a series of studies he made of a war veteran in 1882.620 Cafe Terrace at NightOil on canvas, 1888. This work was the first in a trilogy of paintings that featured starlit skies, completed over two years. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the painting and wrote to his sister: \u0027Here you have a night picture without any black in it, done with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square acquires a pale sulphur and greenish citron-yellow colour. It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot... I find satisfaction in painting things immediately.\u00271888, oil on canvas. The five customers in the scene have described as \u0027three drunks and derelicts in a large public room... huddled down in sleep or stupor.\u0027 Van Gogh told his brother that the cafe owner, Ginoux, had taken so much money it was time to take his revenge by painting the place.820 Bedroom in ArlesOil on canvas, 1888. Three authentic versions of this painting were made, easily discernible from the different paintings on the right wall. Oil on canvas, 1888. This painting is currently at the National Gallery in London. It was completed after Van Gogh moved from the Hotel Carrel to the Cafe de la Gare at Arles, south France. 1885, oil on canvas. Van Gogh chose this deliberately tricky composition to prove himself as a figure painter, wanting to show the way \u0027they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish... that they have thus honestly earned their food\u0027. 1120 Road with Cypress and Star1890, oil on canvas. Also known as Country Road, this was the last painting Van Gogh made in Saint Remy, It is part of the large Van Gogh collection at the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo in the Netherlands.1220 Starry Night Over the Rhone1888, oil on canvas. Another of Van Gogh\u0027s paintings of Arles at nighttime – painted at a spot on the bank of the Rhone a few minutes walk from the Yellow House, which he was renting at the time. 1888, oil on canvas. In a short space of time during his first weeks at Arles, Van Gogh painted some fifteen orchards, hoping they would sell well because his subject, the glorious blossoms of the flowering trees, had the power to \u0027cheer everyone up\u0027. 1420 Self Portrait with a Grey Felt Hat1887, oil on canvas. This self portrait is slightly unusual because Van Gogh\u0027s face is angled to face straight towards the observer. Most of them depicted the face as it appeared in the mirror he used, so the right side seen in the image was actually the left side of his face. 1888 - 1890, oil on canvas. Van Gogh loved flowering trees, which to him symbolised hope and new life. This painting was created to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, the son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo.This was part of Van Gogh\u0027s preparation for The Potato Eaters, where he attempted to paint a figure against the light. He struggled, telling his brother Theo: \u0027It\u0027s a difficult effect\u0027, yet he succeeded in a strong contrast with the almost-black head of the woman and the use of white for the window, which focuses the gaze mainly on the woman\u0027s hands. 1720 Peasant Woman Against a Background of WheatOil on canvas, 1890. This painting, one of several versions by Van Gogh, has exchanged hands several times and was bought by Stephen Wynn in 1997 for $47.5 million. Seven years later, it was sold to American investor Steven A Cohen for more than $100 million. Oil on canvas, 1889. In the cypress trees of Saint Remy, Van Gogh found beauty as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk. He was enraptured but also challenged: \u0027It\u0027s the dark patch in a sun-drenched landscape, but it\u0027s one of the most interesting dark notes, the most difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine\u0027. 1888, oil on canvas. Art historians believe this is the only Van Gogh painting he managed to sell during his lifetime, and has been listed among his major works. It was sold in Brussels for 400 francs (about £3,000) to Anna Boch, an impressionist painter and art collector from Belgium, who was the sister of Van Gogh\u0027s friend Eugene Boch. 2020 Wheatfield with Crows1890, oil on canvas.Commonly regarded as Van Gogh\u0027s final painting (with some doubt from art historians due to lack of historical records). Around 10 July Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo and wife Jo Bonger to say he had painted another three large canvases since visiting them in Paris the week before. Two of them, he said, expressed sadness and what he called \u0027extreme loneliness\u0027, but he also believed them to show the healthy and fortifying nature of the countryside. 1886, oil on canvas.

The nearby Church of the Ascension, which had control of the building, decided to sell it, prompting the extraction of Haring’s work, which reportedly cost about $900,000.The preservation of Haring’s mural had become a topic of concern since speculation that the church would sell or lease the building emerged in 2016.Haring was involved in the Jesus Movement of the Seventies as a teenager.

Sebastian Smee looks back at the work of Gordon ParksFive months after the inauguration of president John Kennedy, Gordon Parks, the famous photographer for Life magazine, found himself on a plane to Rio de Janeiro. As he cruised along at 30,000 feet, an immense thought pressed in: I am about to save a boy’s life.His name was Flavio da Silva, and he lived in a favela called Catacumba on the steep hillsides of Rio. Days earlier, the boy had written: “This is a dream, and I shall end by awakening.”\u0026nbspBut it wasn’t. It wasn’t a dream. It was his life.Though neither he nor Parks could have foreseen it, Flavio was about to become a pawn in a battle between two media titans: one in the United States, the other in Brazil. Both publications were trying to influence public opinion at a time when the ideological and geopolitical stakes felt frighteningly high.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Life’s circulation at the time was around 7 million copies, the highest in the land, and its Republican-leaning editors weren’t shy about using that influence.\u0026nbspIt was the height of the Cold War. Fidel Castro’s grip on Cuba had tightened after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Latin America looked vulnerable to a communist takeover. Life decided to launch a five-part series titled “Crisis in Latin America”. Parks, the first African American to work as a staff photographer at the magazine, was assigned to the second part.Brazil, like the US, had a new president, Jânio Quadros. Quadros inherited an economy in crisis. He implemented an austerity programme, of which the US approved. But when the United States offered $300m\u0026nbsp(£234m) in foreign aid in return for cooperating with US\u0026nbspopposition to Castro’s Cuba, Quadros rejected it. The offer, he felt, was an insult to Brazil’s autonomy. It was tantamount to a bribe.Life editors liked to script photo assignments in advance. Parks was told to go to the Rio favelas, “find an impoverished father with a family of eight to 10 children. Show how he earns a living. Explore his political leanings. Is he a communist, or about to become one?”They wanted Parks to round out the family shots with images providing some social context: ideally, a political rally in the favelas.Parks had been uneasy about the assignment from the beginning. He had his own ideas. But an ally at Life urged him to accept, saying: “Rio de Janeiro is a long, long way from Rockefeller Plaza. Who knows, you might just misinterpret your instructions?”The first thing was to find a suitable family. Parks went to the favelas on a steaming hot day in March 1961. He was accompanied by José Gallo, who managed the local bureau of Time Inc, Life’s owner. As they climbed up a “tangled maze of shacks”, Parks saw Flavio, who was carrying a 40-pound tin of water on his head and who – he would soon discover – suffered from severe asthma.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His legs looked like sticks covered with skin and screwed into two dirty feet. He stopped for breath, coughing, his chest heaving as the water slopped over his shoulder and distended belly.”Parks had his subject. He met Flavio’s seven siblings in their home, high up the Catacumba hillside, and, that evening, his parents. Flavio’s mother, Nair, worked as a washerwoman. She was 35, and pregnant with their ninth child. His father, José Manuel, was 42. He had a kiosk selling kerosene and detergent.\u0026nbspMunizThe J Paul Getty Museum)Parks had travelled widely – including an earlier trip to Rio – but never had he seen such destitution. He and Gallo explained themselves and asked for permission to carry out their assignment. “You can photograph us,” José replied, eventually, “but you must show us in a good light.”“Just doing my job,” we journalists tell ourselves. The lives we affect, and sometimes rearrange, are rarely changed intentionally. We maintain this stance even when it feels suspiciously convenient, discharging us from the obligation to anticipate consequences.\u0026nbspThen again, some consequences are hard to anticipate.\u0026nbspParks finished his assignment, largely ignoring the instruction to focus on the father and his political leanings. Instead, he focused on Flavio and on Flavio’s brothers and sisters. He kept a diary of his days in the favela. He was there when the children woke up. He photographed them in the rudimentary kitchen. He even took them by car to Copacabana. The famous beach was just 15 minutes away, but they had never seen it, and Parks recorded their euphoric responses.\u0026nbspEach night he left the favela and returned, uneasy, to his room in Copacabana’s upscale Hotel Excelsior. Parks had grown up the youngest of 15 children and the victim of racist bullying. Now a parent himself, he couldn’t help but empathise with Flavio. He wrote of being “filled with confusion and guilt during my final days in Catacumba. Flavio, like thousands of other children, would die\u0026nbsp... I could not help compare the good fortune of my own children with the fate of these others”.But it wasn’t a lie.\u0026nbspPark’s photos appeared in the 16 June 1961, issue of Life under the heading, “Freedom’s Fearful Foe: Poverty.” You can see them in the first room of “Gordon Parks: The Flavio Story”, a riveting show at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The second, third and fourth rooms uncover the bewildering events that the photo essay set in motion.\u0026nbspParks belonged to a generation of photojournalists whose work could get massive exposure. He said he wanted his work “to draw people’s attention to the problems they show” and to play a role in effecting change. An admirer of President Kennedy, he hoped that the new president’s youth and progressive policies would have positive results. But he had seen firsthand, too, that the United States lacked credibility in Latin America. If it wanted to solve problems there, he realised, the United States needed first to “clean up its own yard”.Intimate, observant, poetically suggestive, Parks’s photos of Flavio and his family were the work of an artist. “Far from condescending, they utterly personalised ... and made intimate the tragedy of poverty,” Paul Roth wrote in the show’s terrific catalogue. (Roth’s essay is the source of much of the information in this story). They “punctured”, he said, Life magazine’s “conception of indigence as an abstract lure to an ideological foe” – communism.\u0026nbspParks’s photo essay was one of the most influential Life ever published. It provoked an enormous response from readers, who sent thousands of letters and unsolicited donations. When Life published excerpts from the letters in a subsequent issue, under the headline “A Great Urge to Help Flavio”, it included an appeal for more donations, which Life said it would use to move the Da\u0026nbspSilvas\u0026nbspto a modest new home and to seek medical treatment for Flavio.\u0026nbspParks flew back to Rio on 28 June to deliver the message. To his relief, Flavio’s parents needed no persuading to release Flavio to the care of a hospital in Denver. “Keep him in hospital as long as necessary but please bring him back cured and well,” his father said.\u0026nbspAt Parks’s hotel, Flavio had his first-ever bath (“The water was black,” Parks noted) and donned new clothes that Parks had bought for him. A team of people worked on getting Flavio a visa and on finding a suitable home for his family.The day came for the family to move out of Catacumba. Their story had spread, and a crowd gathered to watch. Parks, who was there to document the day, remembered a woman grabbing his shoulder and saying: “What about us? All the rest of us stay here to die!”\u0026nbspThat same night, Parks and Gallo drove Flavio to the airport,\u0026nbspand all three flew to the United States.In Denver, Flavio was treated at the Children’s Asthma Research Institute and Hospital. Life photographer Carl Iwasaki documented the first days of his life in Denver, including visits to the hospital, first days at school and a visit to an amusement park. The photographs of Flavio 2.0 – designed above all, it can seem, to make America feel good about itself – were published in the magazine’s 21 July issue.\u0026nbspThe repercussions of this intervention went beyond Flavio and his family. Editors at O Cruzeiro, an illustrated weekly in Brazil, took umbrage at Parks’s photo essay (which had appeared in a Spanish-language version of Life, distributed throughout South America).\u0026nbspO Cruzeiro had Brazilian nationalist leanings. Its editors objected to a high-circulation US\u0026nbspmagazine with an explicit political agenda coming to Brazil to point out problems that had not been solved in its own country.\u0026nbspTheir response was impudent, blunt and charged with chutzpah. They sent a photographer of their own, Henri Ballot, to New York City. After photographing the streets of impoverished communities in Spanish Harlem and on the Lower East Side, Ballot homed in on Puerto Rican immigrants Felix and Esther Gonzalez. They lived with their six children in a dilapidated, rat- and cockroach-infested tenement building on Rivington Street.\u0026nbspBallot’s photographs were published in the 7 October 1961 issue of O Cruzeiro. They revealed living conditions every bit as desperate as those of the Da Silvas. One photograph shows a child sleeping with three enormous cockroaches on his bare skin. Another shows a child with a bandage covering a rat bite on his forehead. O Cruzeiro rammed home its point by publishing some of Ballot’s New York images with insets showing Park’s original Rio images.\u0026nbspThe two magazines went to war, each accusing the other of staging its photographs – of, effectively, manufacturing “fake news”. And, as happens routinely in any polarised media environment, real people enduring real predicaments were reduced to pawns in a propaganda war.The ultimate guide to Rio de JaneiroHighway 61: Jessica Lange’s photography explores her midwestern rootsMeanwhile, in Denver, the transition proved tricky for Flavio. He struggled at school. But things slowly settled down. He learned English, adapted his behaviour and spent weekends with a Portuguese-speaking family, the Gonçalves. Over time, he had less and less contact with his family back in Rio. And when the treatment neared its conclusion after two full years, he was desperate to remain.\u0026nbspHe begged Parks and the Gonçalves to adopt him. Instead, in July 1963, Flavio returned to Rio, where he stayed briefly with his family before being sent to a boarding school in São Paulo. The schooling was arranged and paid for by Life.\u0026nbspParks maintained contact with Flavio after the boy’s return to Brazil, and in 1978, he published a book (Flavio) about the experience, which brought him back to Rio to gather material. Parks also visited in 1999 to film a documentary (Gordon Parks – Half Past Autumn). In each of those trips, the journalist saw that his subject’s struggles with poverty had never really abated.\u0026nbsp“As a photojournalist,” Parks wrote, with more than a tinge of melancholy, “I have occasionally done stories that have seriously altered human lives. In hindsight, I often wonder if it might not have been wiser to have left those lives untouched, to have let them grind out their time as fate intended.”Flavio himself, now retired from his job as a security guard, later reflected on the fact that, thanks to Parks, “people know more about my life than I do. I’m glad that I’m alive as a result ... (But) this story never made me feel either better or worse than anyone else.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The suits are then assembled – usually four months prior to flight.While there are no differences between a male and female spacesuit, female astronauts usually wear a smaller size.\u0026nbspBoth Ms Koch and Ms Meir are wearing medium-size suits, with Ms Koch’s spacesuit featuring red stripes.In a recent interview, Ms Koch spoke about the significance of this spacewalk, saying: “I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing.“In the past women haven’t always been at the table.“It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space programme at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role.“That can lead in turn to increased chance for success. There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories of people who look like them, and I think it’s an important story to tell.”Ms Koch, an electrical engineer, has been living in space since March while Ms Meir, a marine biologist, joined the ISS crew in September.Both are members of Nasa’s Astronaut Class of 2013.Ms Koch is more than 200 days into her mission and is slated to set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman – with an expected total of 328 days in space.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

While that proportion doesn’t seem high at first glance, the practice can add up to millions of dollars.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were winning ever greater support but, somehow, still appearing to lose the battle.Record-breaking crowds had turned up for the Put It To The People rally in the capital in March. Increasing numbers of politicians and experts – and Gary Lineker – were throwing their weight behind the idea. An online poll asking for Article 50 to be revoked had just topped 4 million signatures.Yet somehow, despite all this – or perhaps because of it – this mass movement was being characterised, with some success, as representing the views of only a minor metropolitan elite.It did not, its critics said, understand the midlands or the north. It did not understand small towns. It did not understand the working class.“Have these people ever even been in a Wetherspoon’s?” Martin Daubney, now a Brexit Party MEP, asked me in Wolverhampton in April. Raise the idea of a second vote in there, he added, “and see how it goes down”.By May, on the back of such claims, his group had won 29 out of 71 seats at the European Parliament elections – including almost half of those available in England outside of London.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“We realised there was a disconnect between this narrative and the actual reality,” says Kevin Keith, director of People’s Vote North, today. “We knew from polling that support for a second referendum was strong all over the UK, and certainly so in the north.Government can’t ‘play Santa’ with firms after no deal, report warnsSketch: Brexit is in the hands of the idiots, and they’ve dropped itLabour ready to vote for Final Say referendum on Boris Johnson dealCampaigners release ‘six tests Johnson will fail’ on BrexitPeople’s Vote rally sees campaigners demand second say in SunderlandPeople’s Vote rally in Yorkshire sees celebs demand second vote“But, somehow, this view that the north was just a homogenised mass of Leave voters had almost become received wisdom. It wasn’t true then and it isn’t true now. So we realised we needed a platform to challenge that myth.”And now, as campaigners prepare for what could become one of the biggest marches ever held in the capital on Saturday, it is perhaps safe to say that challenge has been met and that myth busted.More than 175 coaches will make their way to London from towns and cities across the UK, full of people asking to be asked again. Underground users have been told to expect large crowds around St Pancras, King’s Cross and Euston – the stations that connect London to the north and Midlands.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt comes after 11 rallies were staged across the UK throughout summer and autumn in what were billed by People’s Vote bosses as a show of national strength.More than 12,000 people attended events from Cheltenham in the south to Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland and Belfast over the Irish Sea. In supposed\u0026nbspLeave-strongholds, such as Sunderland, Derby and Newport, hundreds turned out. In Brighton, 5,000 supporters attended a beach-front Let us Be Heard rally. In Leeds, campaigners cheered as footballing legend Peter Reid dispensed with niceties: “shambollocks”, he said when asked to describe the last three years in a single word.“There was a feeling that yes, big London marches are massively important in helping create real political pressure but we also had to be out in the regions showing what we already knew: that there was mass support for a second vote – everywhere,” says Mr Keith. “This idea that Sunderland, for instance, had become a no-go area if you wanted a second vote – it’s just a lie. Sunderland is going to be one of the cities hit hardest by Brexit and there is huge hunger there for a chance to have another say.”Curbishley, Alastair Campbell, Peter Reid and Garreth Carvell during June’s People’s Vote rally in Leeds (PA)Among the activists at the Stadium of Light that Sunday afternoon was Louise Brown, a committee member with North East for Europe. “A lot of us will stand on stalls in town centres and it’s hard work because not everyone agrees with what we’re trying to do,” she told me as the day’s audience filed past, all EU flags and Bollocks to Brexit stickers. “But when you come to an event like this, it drives home how devastating leaving the EU will be and how important what we’re doing is.”The devastation spoken about differed from region to region and depended on what calamitous no deal revelation had been brought into the open that particular week but concerns generally riffed on similar themes: economic deprivation, job losses, an NHS vulnerable to predatory privatisation, a country less able to protect itself against terrorism, climate change and cyberattacks.“The scale of just how bad a no deal would be was emerging constantly over the summer,” says Mr Keith. “And I think that naturally brought more people to us. What we noticed anecdotally was that we were getting more and more Leave voters supporting us because there was a growing realisation that the Brexit we were told would happen in 2016 never really existed.”At each event, an ever-rotating list of political speakers – Tories, Labour, Anna Soubry – were joined by comedians, sports stars and business people.\u0026nbspThe Derby rally may be the only place Michael Heseltine and Margaret Beckett have ever shared a stage. Almost certainly, these events showed footage of the one time you’ll ever hear erstwhile Coronation Street star Denise Welch ponder international import and export tariffs. “Where are all these trade deals?” she wondered in a video message.Boris Johnson’s Brexit plans receive crushing blow from DUPIn Edinburgh, Alistair Campbell played Ode To Joy on the bagpipes, while in Leeds John Barnes compared Brexit to a bad VAR decision. Let’s replay it, he suggested, and get it right.“I think there’s no doubt this is one of the most varied political campaigns in recent decades,” says Richard Brooks, the 27-year-old co-founder of For our Future’s Sake, ostensibly the movement’s youth wing. “The people who come can’t be pigeon-holed – they’re young, old, middle class, working class. It goes across so many spectrums. We’ve had events where there’s been a 20-something Northern Irish apprentice on stage with someone who’s been a member of the Tory party for decades. We’re uniting people constantly.”Critics would say, of course, that these are still relatively small numbers.A ComRes poll published on Wednesday showed that, overwhelmingly, people wanted to honour the results of the original referendum. Fifty-four per cent of those questioned said the UK should leave the EU. Only 32 per cent said it should not. All regions had a Leave majority\u0026nbsp– save for London, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In a similar survey carried out by BMG between July and October, fewer than one in five people said they wanted another referendum.And, yet, as the political landscape has changed on an almost daily basis – the first northern rally was held way back in the era when Theresa May was still prime minister before Yellowhammer was revealed when the prorogation of parliament was not yet a twinkle in Dominic Cummings’ eye –\u0026nbspand politics has mutated, something remarkable has happened. Support for a People’s Vote – a consistent, accessible plan to move things forward – has kept gaining momentum.Hilary Benn – who, whatever happens next, may come to be considered one of his generation’s few politicians of stature – came on board, despite previous reservations. Every opposition party, bar one, has now said they favour a second vote. Labour’s position may still remain ambiguous under Jeremy Corbyn, but, if rumours are to be believed, it won’t stay that way if chancellor John McDonnell gets his way.And now, on Saturday: a new London march, which organisers say could attract up to 1.5 million people from all corners of the UK.“Only an idiot would dismiss that as anything other than a mass movement,” adds Mr Keith. “I compare this to a journey where it’s not just the landscape that’s constantly changing but even the road you’re driving on keeps moving about.“But if you have your destination in mind – a final vote – it’s just a case of keeping your sights steady, holding your nerve and doing your best to get there. I believe we’re closer now than we ever have been. The country needs it. One way or another, it’s the only possible way out of this mess.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He claimed that the EU\u0027s enlargement process was in general need of an overhaul. Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described the move as historic error, while Council president Donald Tusk agreed it was\u0026nbspa mistake.Macedonia officially changes name to North Macedonia to end disputeWhy is Macedonia considering changing its name?EU leaders have long said that if the former Yugoslav republic changed its name from Macedonia to end a decades-long dispute with Greece, its application could go ahead.The name change was politically costly for the country\u0027s government, which faced domestic opposition from nationalists. On Friday afternoon its foreign minister accused EU leaders of not being straightforward with us, but thanked those leaders who backed his country in the room.There was more widespread opposition on the European Council to opening talks with Albania, which some leaders argue has not made enough progress on reforms, including to the rule of law. Other than France,\u0026nbspDenmark and the Netherlands raised concerns.A compromise plan proposed by the Netherlands\u0027 prime minister Mark Rutte to open talks with North Macedonia only failed, with EU leaders refusing to separate the two countries\u0027 bids from one another.A\u0026nbspnumber of countries were reluctant regarding today\u0027s opening of negotiations, and France was part of them, Mr Macron confirmed.\u0026nbspHe said the EU was struggling to take effective decisions with 28 members, and that\u0026nbspbefore any effective enlargement we must reform ourselves.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The states launched an unsuccessful diplomatic offensive ahead of the meeting to try and undermine the French veto.\u0026nbspGermany\u0027s Angela Merkel was also supportive of opening talks, saying that she deplored the decision not to proceed.Unfortunately we were not able to reach agreement, she told a press conference on Friday after the meeting. We were not able to reach unanimity regarding that position. I very much deplore this fact.\u0026nbspShe said North Macedonia had done a lot to meet conditions set by the bloc, adding: Albania too has made progress on the vetting process – the appointment of new judges is a far-reaching measure indeed that many countries in the Western Balkans have not yet got around to doing.\u0026nbspThe chancellor continued: I always make the point that we have to be reliable when we make promises, when we set standards we have to be predictable in our responses instead of turning our backs on them and saying \u0027well, you\u0027ve done quite well, but we\u0027ve thought of something new\u0027.I\u0027ve always thought it was in Europe\u0027s interest to engage these countries in Europe. When you take a look at the map you get an idea of how important that is. We\u0027re talking about countries here that want to become members of the European Union.Speaking at the close of the summit, Council president Mr Tusk told reporters: The overwhelming majority wanted to open accession talks with North Macedonia and Albania, however such a decision requires unanimity and there was no unanimity yesterday.\u0026nbspLet me be very clear –\u0026nbspare not to blame for this and the Commission reports are also clear that both these countries did what they were asked to do.mBoth countries have the right to start negotiations as of today: they are ready. Unfortunately a few member states are not ready yet. This is why we did not manage to reach a positive decision. Personally I think it was a mistake but I will not comment on it further.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester throws a tire on a fire to block the highway north of Beirut, Lebanon.

I fully understand your frustration because you did your share and we haven\u0027t. The EU a complex political entity and it is true that sometimes it takes too long to decide, but I have absolutely no doubt that one day you will become full members of the European Union.Mr Tusk, who comes from Poland,\u0026nbspcontinued: You should never give up. I remember the first time I started to dream of a European future for my country. I think I was maybe 30, 35 years old. I had to wait 25 years for this.Nikola Dimitrov, North Macedonia\u0027s foreign minister, said on Friday afternoon after the result of the meeting had become clear: The least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us.\u0026nbspIf there is no more consensus on the European future of the Western Balkans, if the promise of Thessaloniki 2003 does not stand, the citizens deserve to know.\u0026nbspGratitude to all leaders that fought hard for the EU to open accession talks with us, thus acknowledging and anchoring the historic Prespa Agreement, encouraging domestic reforms and underpinning the European narrative in North Macedonia, a candidate country for 14 years.\u0026nbspWhile we wait for a renewed consensus, we must continue to defend true European values at home.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Police confirmed they were investigating whether religious faith was involved in the family\u0027s alleged incarceration.Mr van Dorsten was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of “depriving people of their liberty, harming the health of others and money laundering”, Dutch police said in a statement.“We have reason to believe that the six people involved did not stay at the premises out of free will. We are investigating whether following a certain belief in life or faith has led to the living situation in which the people were found,” the police statement said, according to the Agence France-Presse\u0026nbspnews agency.Mr van Dorsten’s six children were found by police after the eldest, a 25-year-old man, turned up at a local bar, drank five beers and told staff he needed help.Created with Sketch.Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2019: The Winners Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115  Grand title winner and Joint Winner, Behaviour: MammalsThe moment by Yongqing Bao, ChinaYongqing BaoWildlife Photographer of the YearNight glow by Cruz Erdmann, New ZealandCruz ErdmannWildlife Photographer of the Year315 Plants and Fungi WinnerTapestry of life by Zorica Kovacevic, SerbiaUSAZorica KovacevicWildlife Photographer of the YearLand of the eagle by Audun Rikardsen, NorwayAudun RikardsenWildlife Photographer of the Year515 Black and White WinnerSnow exposure by Max Waugh, USAMax WaughWildlife Photographer of the YearThe equal match by Ingo Arndt, GermanyIngo ArndtWildlife Photographer of the YearCreation by Luis Vilariño Lopez, SpainLuis Vilariño LopezWildlife Photographer of the Year815 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Portfolio Award WinnerThe huddle by Stefan Christmann, GermanyStefan ChristmannWildlife Photographer of the Year915 10 years and under WinnerHumming surprise by Thomas Easterbrook, UKThomas EasterbrookWildlife Photographer of the YearAnother barred migrant by Alejandro Prieto, MexicoAlejandro PrietoWildlife Photographer of the YearFrozen moment by Jérémie Villet, FranceJérémie VilletWildlife Photographer of the YearEarly riser by Riccardo Marchgiani, ItalyRiccardo MarchegianiWildlife Photographer of the Year1315 Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles WinnerPondworld by Manuel Plaickner, ItalyManuel PlaicknerWildlife Photographer of the YearFace of deception by Ripan Biswas, IndiaRipan BiswasWildlife Photographer of the Year1515 Animals in Their Environment WinnerSnow-plateau nomads by Shangzhen Fan, ChinaShangzhen FanWildlife Photographer of the Year115  Grand title winner and Joint Winner, Behaviour: MammalsThe moment by Yongqing Bao, ChinaYongqing BaoWildlife Photographer of the YearNight glow by Cruz Erdmann, New ZealandCruz ErdmannWildlife Photographer of the Year315 Plants and Fungi WinnerTapestry of life by Zorica Kovacevic, SerbiaUSAZorica KovacevicWildlife Photographer of the YearLand of the eagle by Audun Rikardsen, NorwayAudun RikardsenWildlife Photographer of the Year515 Black and White WinnerSnow exposure by Max Waugh, USAMax WaughWildlife Photographer of the YearThe equal match by Ingo Arndt, GermanyIngo ArndtWildlife Photographer of the YearCreation by Luis Vilariño Lopez, SpainLuis Vilariño LopezWildlife Photographer of the Year815 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Portfolio Award WinnerThe huddle by Stefan Christmann, GermanyStefan ChristmannWildlife Photographer of the Year915 10 years and under WinnerHumming surprise by Thomas Easterbrook, UKThomas EasterbrookWildlife Photographer of the YearAnother barred migrant by Alejandro Prieto, MexicoAlejandro PrietoWildlife Photographer of the YearFrozen moment by Jérémie Villet, FranceJérémie VilletWildlife Photographer of the YearEarly riser by Riccardo Marchgiani, ItalyRiccardo MarchegianiWildlife Photographer of the Year1315 Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles WinnerPondworld by Manuel Plaickner, ItalyManuel PlaicknerWildlife Photographer of the YearFace of deception by Ripan Biswas, IndiaRipan BiswasWildlife Photographer of the Year1515 Animals in Their Environment WinnerSnow-plateau nomads by Shangzhen Fan, ChinaShangzhen FanWildlife Photographer of the YearWhen officers searched the farmhouse in Ruinerwold, Drenthe, they eventually found a door hidden behind a cupboard which led to a secret basement where they found Mr van Dorsten and the five remaining children who had apparently been held there for almost a decade.The 58-year-old Austrian tenant at the farmhouse, named as Josef Brunner, has also been arrested on similar charges to Mr van Dorsten. He was reportedly also a former member of the Unification church, though the organisation has not confirmed this.Buitenhuizerweg in Ruinerwold, Drenthe (EPA)The Unification church said in a statement it was “deeply alarmed to hear of the family being held in inhumane conditions on a farmhouse in the Netherlands.” Mr van Dorsten was briefly a member of our movement in the mid-1980s, it said, but he left in 1987.The church\u0027s statement also revealed that Mr van Dorsten’s brother, Derek van Dorsten, remained “a long-time member” of the movement, and is quoted as saying “I have not heard from my brother since 1984”.It added: “In addition, we are unable to confirm any records of Mr Josef Brunner, the alleged captor, having ever been associated in any way with the Unification church.\u0026nbspWe are grateful that the six victims in this tragedy are now under the care of the local authorities and pray they will be able to heal from their ordeal with time and professional help.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The 58-year-old is described as a furniture worker who also worked on yachts. He was regarded as “an absolute professional”, the report said.Willem Koetsier, a Unification Church member in Amsterdam, also told the paper that after Mr van Dorsten had left the group, he travelled to Germany where it lost track of him. Mr Koetsier said he thought the man “together with someone else” had since started their own cult.When police found Mr van Dorsten in the secret basement, he was apparently ill and in bed, having suffered a suspected stroke two years ago.\u0026nbspAccording to Algemeen Dagblad, at the time Mr van Dorsten joined the Unification movement with his brother in the 1980s, he ascribed “supernatural powers” to himself.His wife and the mother of nine known children died in 2004.\u0026nbspThree of Mr van-Dorsten’s children have come forward and said they left the family eight years ago.\u0026nbspIt is possible he has even more children, the newspaper reports.Before the family moved to the farm in Ruinerwold, they had reportedly stayed at a caravan park where the children were filmed performing cult rituals including walking in circles. This apparently attracted unwanted attention, leading them to move to the secluded farm.Mr van Dorsten’s children, all aged over 18, are now in the care of the Dutch authorities.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It shows how a black market has been set up to off the most wretched in Russian society – using unregulated social media platforms to connect buyers to sellers via unscrupulous agents.\u0026nbspThe exact scale of the illicit trade is unclear, but evidence points to an unhealthy demand. Every month, the most popular Russian search engine registers 85,000 searches of the term “buy a child” in Moscow alone.\u0026nbspFor some, no doubt, it is a way to cut out three years of red tape and complicated adoption law. Often, the women involved are in desperate situations. But the opportunities for abuse of the most horrific kind are also obvious.\u0026nbspThe prices quoted depend on the region and the child’s characteristics, the publication said. Non-Slavic children from the more underdeveloped regions of the Russian Federation are the least expensive. Slavs in Moscow and St Petersburg – the most. Court documents showed that in one case just 5,000 roubles (£60) swapped hands.\u0026nbspThe journalists were offered well-worked schemes to get around social services checks.\u0026nbspVladimir Putin to sign bill banning Americans from adopting RussianFor suspicious-looking men like the imagined Pavel Sarychev, the suggested route was getting the father of an abandoned baby to sign off on the adoption. For women, other options were suggested, including switching babies in the maternity ward under the watchless eyes of corrupted nurses.\u0026nbspThere was little need to worry about being caught, agents said. With corrupted people in all parts of the system working for them, not even a DNA test would stop the trade going through.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hundreds of adoptions were cancelled at the last minute, with children and families left in the lurch.

The Syrian government is hostile to foreign\u0026nbspNGOs\u0026nbspand many remain at risk of arrest.International aid and medical agencies, including Medicines Sans Frontieres, Save the Children, Mercy Corps and DanChurchAid, all released statements saying their intentional staff had\u0026nbspto leave Syria, either partially or fully halting their activities there.The UN said this has disrupted the “supply change” of aid to much of northern Syria, which before the latest conflict was already home to nearly a million displaced people who depended on aid to survive.“Due to changes on the ground and insecurity some NGO partners have had to transfer international staff who were operating in the northeast out of the area, and others have had to temporarily suspend operations,” Hedinn Halldorsson from the agency in Damascus, told The Independent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A slew of countries including the UK has also imposed arms embargoes on Ankara, to little effect.\u0026nbspBut despite the mounting pressure, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan remained defiant, saying earlier: “We will never declare a ceasefire.”Back in Syria, meanwhile,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspa rebel spokesman confirmed that the “operation is ongoing in\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain.” From the Turkish side of the border, ambulances could be seen in war-ravaged town racing away from the front,\u0026nbsptowards hospitals.A briefing paper released by the Turkish government said the town centre of\u0026nbspRas\u0026nbspal-Ain\u0026nbsphad been “cleared out of terrorists” along with 1,217 sq km of territory.Aid workers in Syria said international staff having to evacuate the country because of regime presence,\u0026nbspwould only see the humanitarian crisis worsen.\u0026nbspThe Kurdish Red Crescent (KRC)\u0026nbspcalled the sudden withdrawal\u0026nbspa “disaster” saying the KRC’s 1,000 or so staffers and volunteers were unable to shoulder the burden alone.“Coordination has almost collapsed since the international staffers had to leave. The burden was on them to secure cross border aid. We were also dependent on our partners to get funds, we need international doctors to support us,” the KRC’s Dr Sherwan Berry said.Turkey ‘effectively holding 50 US nuclear bombs hostage’ at air baseRussian soldiers filmed apparently moving into US Syria baseNine suspected Isis members escape from camp in Syria, says FranceMilitary veterans Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Buttigieg clash over SyriaHow Russia is filling the gap left by Trump’s withdrawal of US troops “We have such a load on our shoulders. We don’t have enough staff to man the hospitals, we lost a lot of clinics to shelling and bombing, we have 300,000 displaced people needing food, shelter, water and medical care. We are struggling to provide for them,” he added.He said that KRC ambulances had been targeted by Turkish strikes and several hospitals taken out of service because of the fighting.“Tens of thousands of internally displaced civilians are sleeping on the ground, lacking food, medicine and water,” he added.A senior foreign humanitarian professional, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said should the regime retain control of northeast Syria and the border\u0026nbspit would be “catastrophic” as they would not be able to return.\u0026nbsp“International aid agencies have been supporting hospitals in all the major towns and cities, they have been doing water tucking, bread distribution, rehabilitating schools, water stations and irrigations canals. They are the only actors working on de-mining,” the humanitarian worker said.Created with Sketch.Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Turkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehicles“Our local partners and the UN cannot handle this alone” the worker added.Robert Onus, MSF Emergency Manager for Syria, said it was “impossible” to work in the current insecurity and they were “extremely worried about the safety of our Syrian colleagues and their families”.“Before the fighting, you already had hundreds of thousands of displaced people who were 100 per cent reliant on aid to survive,” Onus told The Independent.\u0026nbspHe said this was now compounded by fresh large-scale displacement, increased trauma burden from war, reduction in ability to deliver aid, as well as suspension of activities.“The crisis is already upon us, it is just about what magnitude it will take,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The new Secretary of State gave a staunch defence of Universal Credit today, arguing that her Suffolk constituents would give it a . out of ten.She also refused to accept there was a link between the benefit cap and child poverty.And the Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield told MPs that there were , cases of suspected Universal Credit fraud being investigated after reports of scams."},{"url":null,"title":"reaminer mps sabotage brexit","story":"The “People’s Vote” mob have repeatedly told the world that Britain has changed its mind and is itching to reverse Brexit.

I cant give up the responsibility my father has given me and worked so hard for. The Guzman era continues to reign.“I want to make it very clear, theres no successor to my father, not just anyone can fill these shoes. He is still giving orders.”The -year-old was the second of four children born to El Chapo’s first we María Salazar Hernández, but older brother Cesar was killed by a rival cartel in .A self-confessed playboy, Ivan constantly gloats about his party lestyle, surrounding himself with scantily-clad girls and posting pictures from exclusive nightclubs.On one picture, in which he is boarding a private jet, he wrote: “I distract myself with women, but always on top of business.”In another, the bachelor – dubbed “Ivan the Terrible” by one follower – crouches down in front of a silver Mercedes hugging a pet lion.Recent posts include a bottle of £ liqueur Don Julia , a £, Jeep Cherakona and a fleet of supercars with the caption Always thank God for everything he gives you.The swaggering crime boss is rivalled in his luxury lestyle by younger brother Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar – known as Alfredo or Alfredito.Alfredo recently posted a picture of himself flying a private jet with the caption: “Ok plebs, Im leaving you behind.”He also posts pictures of his pet lion cubs with one sitting on the boot of his red Bentley.Like his brother, Alfredo is fond of weapons and posts pictures of guns as well as heavily-armed members of the cartel.In one, he holds an arsenal of weapons with the caption, “for those who want to step onto my turf, I give them my army”.In another, he took a gun to the cinema, posting a picture of popcorn and a gun with the caption, “Ive got my toy with me in case anyone wants to make things exciting.”Alfredo was indicted for drug trafficking in Illinois in  and in , he was kidnapped by a rival drug gang who held him at gunpoint in a restaurant before marching him out.El Chapo’s daughter, Alejandrina Gisselle, is staunch defender of her cocaine baron dad and once boasted, “Im beautul because of my mother, intelligent because of my father, and a murderer because of me”.In the week her father was sentenced, Alejandro launched her new line of clothing and accessories named El Chapo , featuring his face on ious T-shirts and tops.On her website she insists her father is “a friend of everyone,” a “willing leader” and “a humble orange vendor with many goals and great ambition.” El Chapos second marriage, to wanted drug runner Griselda Lopez Perez, produced three boys, Edgar, Ovidio and Joaquin.Although not his oldest son, Edgar was his fathers chosen successor but was kept out of the family business until he finished school.But at , against his fathers wishes he travelled to Chicago on a drug deal and on his , attempted to sneak back into his fathers compound in Culiacan in a red SUV.The car was reportedly fired on by El Chapos own men, as it wasnt recognised, and took  bullets, killing Edgar and his friend instantly.Like his half-brothers, Joaquin - who calls himself El Chino Anthrax - loves the high le.In one Twitter post he is pictured with Paris Hilton with the hashtag El Chinos babes.Another has a picture of a gold-plated, diamond-encrusted hand gun and he often posts pictures of himself clubbing as well as his pet tiger chained to the back of his luxury x.In contrast, Ovidio - whose arrest caused the eruption of violence this week - prefers the quiet le.His Twitter profile says: I am not into luxury and sports cars, I like horses and fine roosters.But he continues to be heavily involved in the cartel and often posts messages from the ranch in Culiacan showing a semi-automatic in his SUV, with messages like: Lets go to work because there are dogs that want to get to the ranch.He recently retweeted a message from the family business suggesting El Chapo still pulls the strings.It read: That the lord is confined does not mean that he does not continue giving orders.El Chapo’s third we , former beauty queen Emma Coronel Aispuro, married El Chapo in  and stood by him at his trial.The mother of twin eight-year-olds, Emali and Maria Joaquina, she frequently posts pictured of exotic holidays on her Instagram and recently threw a lavish barbie-themed party for the girls.Calornian woman Rosa Isela Guzmán Ortiz is widely believed to be El Chapos oldest daughter, born from an affair with a woman in Jalisco, according to his mother.Rosa has claimed that El Chapo visited her in the US twice and writes to her from prison.But, judging by his childrens lestyle, theres still plenty to go round. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: AP:Associated PressEl Chapos weand twin daughters at the New York trialOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I used to think doctors were second only to God. That belief was shattered when I was told by the NHS that saving my daughter was ‘futile’.”Tafida had a rare condition, known as an AVM, which caused a massive bleed inside her head in February.She was on le support at the Royal London Hospital in East London since suffering the brain injury, and health bosses tried to block attempts to take the little girl to the Gaslini children’s hospital in Genoa.Today Shelina and her husband Mohammed share with Sun readers the inside story of Operation Tafida, the mercy flight that this week had the world watching and praying.Our exclusive pictures, taken by her relieved parents, show Tafida staring at her mum on the intensive care ward at Gaslini.As doctors carried out a series of tests on the little girl, Shelina gently explained to her: “We have come to Italy, Tafida, where your journey begins. The people here will make you better.”Shelina, who turned  on Thursday, added: “I’m sure it won’t be long before we can get her out of bed and into a wheelchair and begin to stimulate her brain by showing her new things.“All she has seen since she first became ill is a hospital ceiling.“The most important thing for me is that all the nurses and doctors here are so positive.“Tafida’s story has been carried on the news in Italy for weeks and it seems everyone knows who she is and wishes us well.“I know I am leaving my family behind and it will be a completely dferent way of le for us, but I also know in my heart that this is where she will begin to get better.“I always said that the miracle would comeshe was given time. Here, she has time to improve.“We can wait as long as it takes. I have the best present I could ever wish for here in this hospital. The doctors are so positive and are willing her to get better.“A massive weight has been lted from our shoulders.”Scans of Tafida’s vital organs taken in the last few days by medics in the intensive care ward show her heart and lungs have not suffered from spending eight months on le support in London.In the coming days she will have a tracheostomy operation that will free her from being attached to a machine. She will no longer have to have a breathing tube in her nose.Her dad Mohammed said: “This journey to Italy has given us hope, hope that Tafida will have the best le that we can give her. We are convinced that with the treatment available at the Gaslini hospital, Tafida will improve dramatically in the coming weeks and months.”He praised his we, a solicitor, for directing the court battle against the NHS.Mohammed, , a construction consultant, said: “Nobody expected us to win. But we did and she is now in a place where she will be looked after and her le cherished.” The Italian doctors believe that what Tafida needs most is time for the brain to repair itself.While many of the medics at the Gaslini have worked in the NHS and speak good English, Genoa is not a major tourist area.Mohammed, who like Shelina does not speak any Italian, has been communicating with locals through a translation app on his phone to buy food and supplies for their stay.Tomorrow, some of their family will fly in to visit Tafida and the following week her -year-old brother will stay there for half-term.Since June, the family was locked in a battle with doctors at the Royal London Hospital, in Whitechapel, who wanted to turn off their daughter’s le support machine.But two weeks ago they won a landmark case at the High Court when a judge decided they could take their daughter to Italy.After days of planning, the mercy flight to collect Tafida almost did not get off the ground because Genoa was hit by torrential rain and gale-force winds.But just before lunchtime on Tuesday, a Lear jet air ambulance from Italy finally landed at Biggin Hill airfield in Kent.Dr Andrea Moscatelli, director of the Gaslini’s neonatal department, Stefano Pezzato, an expert in resuscitation, and nurse Monica Faggiolo, a specialist in mercy flights, took a private ambulance to the Royal London Hospital, which is run by Barts NHS Trust, to get Tafida.On the sixth-floor ward where she had been confined to her bed, the Italian medical team prepared her for the two-hour flight to Genoa.Barts Trust chief medical officer Dr Alistair Chesser said: “This has been a dficult few months for everyone involved.“I pay tribute to our staff for maintaining high standards of care with the utmost professionalism throughout this period. I am also grateful to the Gaslini team for their co-operation and skill in managing the transfer. Above all, we wish Tafida and her family well for the future.”Mohammed had said his goodbyes on Monday night and was already on a scheduled flight to Genoa with four huge cases packed with enough children’s clothes for the six-month stay and dozens of toys from well-wishers.On the plane he flicked through dozens of photos of his daughter before and after her illness. One of his favourites is a picture taken in the snow the year before outside their home in Plaistow, East London.Shelina finally left the hospital at .pm on Tuesday without even being able to properly thank the nurses who had cared for her daughter round the clock.She was in a car with family, including her -year-old son.On the tarmac at Biggin Hill, Shelina was reunited with her daughter, who was already on board the plane. She said: “Tafida was laying on a stretcher looking around her at everything that was going on.”Two hours later the jet appeared out of the sunset above Genoa’s Christopher Columbus airport and landed. As the plane taxied towards a huddle of waiting dignitaries, Mohammed was whisked to the plane in a minibus.Delighted to see his daughter safely on Italian soil, he left it to the medics to transfer her to a waiting Red Cross ambulance.Tafida was already in bed when Shelina and Mohammed later walked into the intensive care ward.A large group of hospital staff, including the ambulance men in their red suits, stood outside the door like expectant parents waiting for news. Shelina said: “She was fully awake, looking around, thinking ‘Where am I ’.”The future is still uncertain as the family face medical bills of £, on top of court costs of £,. Their appeal for funding has so far raised £,.Her parents will soon be taking their daughter outside to enjoy the warmth of the sun.Mohammed said: “A new chapter has begun for all of us, with hopefully a happy ending when we can take her home.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The numbers will be tight today.One minister believes things are so close that the Speaker John Bercow may end up having to break a tied vote. It is remarkable that Boris Johnson is so close to winning this vote.When the Chief Whip Mark Spencer went through the numbers with the Cabinet on Wednesday, he had the Government succeeding by one vote with the support of the DUP’s ten MPs. But they are now voting against the deal.When Cabinet met again yesterday afternoon, Spencer “scrupulously avoided giving any numbers”, according to one of those present.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who did the numbers for Boris’s leadership bid, said the Government couldn’t afford to lose more than two or three of its own Brexiteers. But with them on board, victory was possible.Without the DUP’s support, which is gone despite Boris Johnson’s belief that they can still be won round, the Government will need the backing of  MPs who were elected as Labour in .Cabinet opinion is split on whether they can get this number. One Cabinet minister intimately involved in the bid to woo Labour MPs thinks they are going to get there.“We’re going to win”, this Secretary of State declares. Others in Cabinet are more sceptical though.One tells me: “I’ll believe it when I see it”, pointing out that Theresa May thought she would do better with Labour MPs on every meaningful vote than she actually did. This minister’s view: “We’re going to fall just short.”Another group whose position is key is the  MPs who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act, which forces the Government to ask for a Brexit extensionMPs don’t back this deal. Downing Street calculate that  of this group will vote for the deal.Three Cabinet ministers — Nicky Morgan, Michael Gove and Robert Buckland — met with a chunk of the  on Thursday afternoon. One of those present tells me: “It wasn’t great. Hammond was particularly dficult.”This source says that watching Hammond, he thought that the former Chancellor “can’t see past that hatred” he has for Boris Johnson.I suspect that most of the  will back the Government, most of them want a deal and many of them want the whip back so they can stand at the next election.As one senior Cabinet minister tells me: “Voting for us is the way back in. We need to be able to count on them for the WAB”, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Then, there are those so-called Spartans — the Tory Brexiteers who wouldn’t vote for May’s deal even at the third time of asking. Downing Street is confident that pretty much all of them will back the deal.I understand that David Trimble, the former Northern Ireland First Minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, will attend this morning’s meeting of the hardcore Brexiteer European Research Group to explain why the deal is in line with the Good Friday Agreement, contrary to what the DUP say.Today, MPs have a chance to honour the referendum result. To vote for a deal that will deliver a smooth, orderly and amicable departure from the EU.If they vote to block it, then they will have shown that they are just determined to stop Brexit and that all those promises to respect the referendum result were made with their fingers crossed behind their backs.THERE’S always a twist with Brexit and today’s is something called the Letwin amendment.If it passes, it would prevent a clean up or down vote on the deal. That would have to wait until a second reading on Tuesday.Instead, the Letwin amendment would force Boris Johnson to request an extension regardless and the Commons would only vote on his deal once all the relevant legislation is through.As one exasperated ally of the PM puts it, the vote on the Letwin amendment is “almost as signicant as the vote itself”. The Letwin amendment is just a preview of the parliamentary mischief to come.As the Government tries to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, MPs will try to add all sorts of things to it.Expect amendments trying to compel the Government to negotiate a customs union with the EU or follow EU rules on things even after Brexit.In a way, these amendments won’t matter. They won’t change the content of the treaty the UK has signed with the EU.But they will impose legal obligations on the Government. Now,Boris won a majority in an election, he could override these changes.But the danger for him is that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party could attack him in the campaign for having passed a deal that has had all these horrors added to it.WE may have a sensible chief medical officer at last.After Sally Davies – who wanted a ban on eating and drinking anything other than water on public transport – we have Chris Whitty.In his first public outing this week, he argued that people should exercise more, stop smoking and keep talking to slow the aging process. Sensible, commonsense advice.Whitty, who was the force behind tackling the  Ebola outbreak, is a pleasant change from the lecturing of the past few years.NUMBER  are oddly relaxed about whether the deal passes today or not. One of the Prime Minister’s most trusted confidants describes it as, “an each-way bet for Boris”.Why, because – in his words –voters, “learn on Saturday that the deal has been voted down, who are they going to blame: Boris or the MPs They’ll blame the MPs”. Inside Number , they think thatBrexiteer MPs back the deal and Remain MPs block it, they can have A CAKE AND EAT IT election strategy.In Labour Leave-supporting seats in Wales, the West Midlands and the North East, they can say: “Your MP is blocking Brexit, vote for us to get it done.”While in the seats they are defending against the Liberal Democrats that are more nervous about Brexit, they can say: “Back us and the UK will leave in a smooth and orderly fashion:This two-pronged message would be electorally potent.

That’s not an easy tightrope to negotiate, and this wasn’t a simple tour for Kate or William for so many reasons.Obviously, security has had to be incredibly tight, far more so than even they are used to, and both of them will have had a full, and possibly rather alarming, briefing from British security services.Then there’s the bittersweet emotional impact on William, who has been retracing his mother’s footsteps during this trip.Diana visited Pakistan several times as a guest of the now Prime Minister Imran Khan and his then we Jemima Goldsmith. She also fell deeply in love with Pakistani-born surgeon Hasnat Khan, and the country and its people always held a special place in her heart.William would have felt very close to his mum as he reconnected with Imran Khan and then went to the same cancer hospital in Lahore that Diana visited just a year before her death.Kate paid her own tribute with a series of stunning outfits subtly taking inspiration from Diana. It’s at times like these that William must miss his mum, and all credit to him for being able to remember her with love and affection, rather than sorrow and trauma.The show-stopping moment for me was when the royal couple emerged from a highly decorated tuk tuk for a glittering reception in Islamabad.Kate was wearing the most stunning emerald gown I think I have ever seen.It was Oscar red carpet-worthy, andthere aren’t copies on the high street for our Christmas parties very soon I will not be best pleased.She looked equally gorgeous a couple of days later playing cricket while wearing a cream shalwar kameez and white trainers.Kate has quietly and effectively emerged as the Queen’s top asset in the Royal Family.Camilla will obviously never have anything like the same respect and affection as Her Majesty, but skipping a generation, Kate has all the attributes to be a very effective Monarch one day at William’s side. She’s bright, beautul and has a big big heart.Since becoming a mum of three, Kate is a much more confident charity ambassador and public speaker, and she’s developed a real connection with all of the children she meets, putting them at ease and making them smile.If the Royal Family is to survive it will all be down to this quiet but determined woman. It’s a heavy burden to place on such slim shoulders, but Kate is more than up to it.THE late Leah Bracknell might have had terminal cancer, but she lived le to the full.The Emmerdale star, who played Zoe Tate for  years and whose death was announced this week, laughed, loved and seized the day.She didn’t do many interviews, but came in to talk to me on my show a couple of years ago after her diagnosis.Leah was funny, brave and determined not to be defined by her illness. She described herself as a “cancer rebel” and we were overwhelmed with ­messages of support and respect for this remarkable woman.She lived and died on her own terms and will be sadly missed.It will be incredible to have the teeniest, tiniest idea of what incredible people such as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and our own Helen Sharman and Tim Peake experienced.For a lelong space geek like me, who watched the moon landings and wanted to be part of the crew of Star Trekthis is the trip of a letime.Will tell you all about it when I’m back.WHAT the hell do these clowns calling themselves environmental “warriors” hope to achieve by targeting hard-working people trying to get to work in the morning Scenes on the London Tube this week were deeply disturbing and frightening, andExtinction Rebellion don’t get a grip, someone is going to get seriously hurt – or even killed.At least they have admitted it was a spectacular own goal to pick on the eco-friendly electric underground, especially during rush hour.They know full well such stupidity has alienated many potential sympathisers.Violence can never be condoned, but I completely understand the sheer frustration of men and women who just wanted to get to their jobs on time, and who took action by pulling a demonstrator off the roof of a train as he kicked out.At one point it was like a chilling scene from a horror film.Most of us agree we need to take action to reverse the effects of climate change before it’s too late, but these sorts of daft demos are not the way to win hearts and minds.As well as being disruptive for the sake of it, such inflammatory actions are potentially extremely dangerous.Believe me, there IS such a thing as bad publicity and although we might be talking about Extinction Rebellion, we aren’t discussing the importance and far bigger picture of global warming.I just don’t expect to see such toxic scenes in the UK, and far from being “warriors”, these idiots are best described as another word beginning with W. And I think we all know which one that is.There are many twists and turns, but suffice to say Arnie is back with some hilariously deadpan zingers, the special effects are in a league of their own, andyou don’t shed a tear at the end you are an unfeeling terminator machine.SCOTT MITCHELL is one of the loveliest men in all of the world. He is having to watch his beloved we Barbara Windsor slowly dissolve in front of his eyes due to the s****y disease that is Alzheimer’s.He has been by her side every step of the way and is now full-time carer for a woman who was once the epitome of independence and the le and soul of the party. This week Scott confessed that he feels “racked with guilt”he leaves his beloved Barbara alone even for a few hours.Scott is fiercely protective of the woman he adores and so patient when the illness has her confused and endlessly repeating herself. He and Barbara have raised thousands of pounds for Alzheimer’s charities as well as vital awareness of the disease.I really just want to give Scott a massive hug, tell him he’s doing a brilliant job and he has absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. Obviously It’s desperately sad that our Barbara is going through such a hellish time, but she struck gold when she met and married her Scott.Vile trolls sending death threats to head judge Shirley Ballas after Radio  DJ Dev was booted off the show last weekend really need to take a long, hard look at themselves.You might have vehemently disagreed with their decision and thrown your popcorn, crisps and prosecco at the TV – or was that just me  – when Dianne and Dev danced their last, but can we just hold on and try to put it all into perspective  It’s a wonderful, warm, fuzzy show that is supposed to be pure entertainment.What in the name of Len Goodman is going on when a couple being voted off a TV show ends up causing such pain and distress to a lovely woman like Shirley Strictly stupid, silly and sad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her pal was seriously injured.Mrs Foster, a graduate of Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School and Queens University Belfast, has three children with husband Brian.Theresa May seemed on the brink of agreeing a deal with Brussels on the first stage of Brexit negotiations, allowing talks to move to trade and the future relationship.One sticking point was the frontier between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland post-Brexit, with all sides keen to avoid theof a hard border.A leaked draft appeared to show the UK had vowed to ensure continued regulatory alignment with the EU so as not to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.The Dublin government claimed it as a victory, while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh leader Carwyn Jones said it meant other parts of the UK could stay in the single market.While Mrs May was meeting EU Commission chief Jean Claude-Juncker, the DUP made a statement that kiboshed what had seemed a done deal.Mrs Foster said Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK and she would not accept anything .The DUP had threatened to pull out of the confidence and supply dealTheresa May caved into demands from Ireland and the EU.Mrs Foster has previously accused the Irish government of hijacking Brexit negotiations to promote a united Ireland.On  November, as Theresa May prepared to address her Cabinet with her agreed Brexit deal, Mrs Foster warned she wont accept a Brexit deal that treats Northern Ireland dferently to the rest of the UK.She rejected suggestions Northern Ireland could remain in the single market and customs union in a special arrangment to keep the border open.Ireland’s PM, Leo Varadkar, warned he would veto any progress in Brexit talks unless the UK came up with proposals to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

oliver letwin brexit amendment remainer","story":"But who is the Tory rebel and what does his amendment mean Sir Oliver Letwin is a Conservative MP for West Dorset.He was previously the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from  to .Letwin was given overall responsibility of the cabinet office in  and is a full member of the Cabinet in the Conservative government.He is also the chairman of the Conservative Research Department and chaired the Conservative Partys Policy Review from -.He recently tabled an amendment for parliament to take control of the Brexit process.Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwins amendment looks to clear the way for a series of indicative votes in the Commons this coming Wednesday.Indicative votes are where sitting MPs vote on a iety of dferent options to seethe will of Parliament supports any single option with a majority on a single given issue.Letwins amendment has cross-party support from Labours Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve.It would essentially mean taking control of the Brexit process away from the government.The amendment will let them decide on what kind of EU exit they want by putting down their own options.It will mean that wounded Mrs May is forced to hand over control of the order paper to them on Wednesday to try and work out a way forward.Brexiteer Suella Braverman told BBC Newsnight: Tonight weve seen a Parliamentary massacre.Priti Patel said it was another example of the political class promising one thing and delivering another.Trust in politics is broken, she said.A spokesman for the Brexit department said this evening it was disappointing to see the amendment pass, and pleaded with MPs to come to a realistic outcome when the Commons debates the way forward in just two days time.They added: This amendment instead upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous, unpredictable precedent for the future.While it is now up to Parliament to set out next steps in respect of this amendment, the Government will continue to call for realism – any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the EU.Parliament should take account of how long these negotiations would take, andthey’d require a longer extension which would mean holding European Parliamentary elections.Jeremy Corbyn congratulated the House of Commons for taking control off the PM and throwing Parliament into more chaos, and said: Where this government has failed this House has and must, succeed.And EU boss Guy Verhofstadt praised tonights news, tweeting: An opportunity to build a cross-party cooperation leading to an enhanced political declaration and a closer future relationship!Yes he is.It is now being said that Letwin is in charge of the Remainer coup following the passing of his amendment.Today the PM refused to back Sir Olivers plan for a series of so-called indicative votes, saying she was sceptical that such a plan would ever work.When we have tried this kind of thing in the past, it has produced contradictory outcomes or no outcome at all, she told MPs earlier.There is a further risk when it comes to Brexit, as the UK is only one half of the equation and the votes could lead to an outcome that is unnegotiable with the EU.MPs could end up forcing through a second referendum or even try to reverse Brexit altogether.However, she tried to see off the rebellion by promising to engage constructively with this process.David Lidington said this evening that the Government would bring forward similar votes this week but refused to go into more detail, which wasnt then enough to win MPs over.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

been such a sticking point Follow our live blog for latest updates from Saturdays emergency Commons sitting to vote on Boris Johnsons Brexit dealThe Irish backstop is essentially a safety net that would prevent the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.Under the agreement negotiated by Theresa May, the UK would enter a transition period after officially leaving the EU during which it would remain a member of the bodys economic zones, namely the single market and the customs union.This would give the Government time to agree the details of our new trading relationship with the European Union and businesses time to adjust with minimal disruption.The backstop would only come into effect once the transition period ends, before all the details of the new relationship had been worked out.In the event the backstop came into force, Northern Ireland would remain a member of the single market until a trade agreement had been reached to keep the border effectively invisible.That would mean goods crossing the Irish border would not be subject to checks for customs or product standards.The whole of the UK would also remain in a common customs territory with the EU, meaning there would be no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes applied to UK-EU trade.The arrangement would keep the Northern Irish border open and minimise economic damage, but would also mean the UK would temporarily have to go on following the EUs rules and regulations without having a say in deciding them.The near-invisibility of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland was a major achievement of the peace process that brought the Troubles to an end.Communities on both sides of the border worry that theof border checks could revive social, cultural and religious ides that have been fading in recent decades.During the Brexit negotiations, the European Union listened to the Irish government about what theof a hard border would mean, and has insisted that any withdrawal agreement should include a backstop.The backstop became a major sticking point when Theresa May was trying to get parliament to back the withdrawal agreement she had negotiated.Many Conservative MPs refused to vote for Theresa Mays deal because, were the backstop ever to come into force, it would leave the UK without a vote in deciding the EUs rules and regulations but still temporarily subject to them.The DUP, a Northern Irish unionist party that currently has  MPs in the House of Commons, refused to accept the backstop because it might leave Northern Ireland in a dferent customs arrangement to the rest of the UK.It was also feared that the backstop could remain in place indefinitely, which could make it dficult for the UK to strike its own trade deals with other countries outside the EU.Boris Johnson twice voted against Theresa Mays deal in Parliament, in part because he objected to the backstop, but decided to back it the third time May put it before the Commons.He repeated his criticism of the backstop while running for the Conservative leadership, and since becoming Prime Minister has said he would not agree a deal that included a backstop.He has said the backstop could be replaced by alternative arrangements to avoid the need for physical checks on the Irish border, though hasnt specied what those arrangements would be.Boris Johnson has opposed the backstop saying it is antidemocratic and could trap the UK in the EUs customs territory.Under the Prime Ministers plans, checks would take place away from the actual border.He has suggested that physical checks would only be required on a small proportion of trade and most checks would take place on the premises of the trader.This would be similar to the arrangement Norway and Sweden have and allow inspectors from each others jurisdictions to carry out checks anywhere on all of Ireland.Mr Johnsons plans have some similarities to the backstop idea.Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations on areas such as agriculture, food safety and industrial goods, while the UK would not be obliged to.But with Mr Johnsons idea Northern Irelands Executive and Assembly would have to approve following the single market arrangement.Then Stormont would have to decide whether or not it wanted to continue following the rules or side with the UK every four years.On October , , the PM unveiled his five-point plan to end the Brexit deadlock.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the latest Brexit proposals from Mr Johnson do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop.A spokesman for the Irish government said a conversation between the two leaders  was constructive and useful but added there was more work to be done.Mr Varadkar indicated that he would study the proposals in further detail, and would consult with the EU in the coming days.A spokesperson for Fianna Fail said the plans were not realistic and fall very far short of what is required.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said it was hard to see how the Ireland-specic Brexit proposals could workthe UK departs from EU standards and rights.Our journalists strive for

Mr Johnson ed to London following dinner on Thursday evening in Brussels, skipping day two of the summit as he attempted to shore up support. Any hope of an easy passage was dashed after the DUP rubbished the fresh agreement. But as well as debating the new deal MPs will also try and amend the legislation. So far they have unveiled three amendments to the deal. But ious groups are furiously drafting further changes they want to table. The most signicant is by ex-Tory Sir Oliver Letwin. It would refuse to approve Boris Johnsonaposs deal in final form tomorrow.  Thataposs because of fears that eventhe deal is approved tomorrow, a no-deal Brexit could still happen by accident. This is a bit tricky to explain - but basically, tomorrow isnapost the final vote on the Brexit deal.MPs will get loads more votes on something called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which is an instrument used to pass the deal formally into law. The problem is thatthe Bill gets stuck or disputed, the aposBenn Actapos - which forces the PM to seek a delay to Brexitthereaposs no deal - will have lapsed because it has an October  deadline.  Sir Oliver fears that,the Withdrawal Bill somehow gets snarled up after October , we could be left in legal limbo on October .So his amendment would decline to approve the Brexit deal unless and until every single vote on the legislation is safely passed. The cross-party amendment has support from Labouraposs Hilary Benn, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, Plaid Cymruaposs Liz Saville Roberts and the SNPaposs Stephen Gethins. Meanwhile, two SNP amendments will also call for a general election and revoking Article  to cancel Brexit - but itaposs unclear whether they will even get called. Speaker John Bercow has the final say over what reaches the floor of the Commons.  Meanwhile a bid to use Saturdayaposs historic session to secure a second referendum is currently on hold - with campaigners looking to next week instead. Remain MPs had planned to tack on a bid to get a second bill. Yesterday they changed the rules surrounding Saturdayaposs sitting in order to leave open the possibility of both Letwinaposs amendment and one on a public vote. But they continued with frantic discussions to try and gameplay the most effective time to bring forward the vote. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October  - though it stills need approval from MPs and could face a narrow defeat. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts checks across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.

There are probably three main options: Do you want to leave with a deal, stay in the EU, or leave without a deal  For pro-Europeans, a new referendum would be a chance to end three years of turmoil. They say the complex issue of EU membership is best solved with a specic question to the public rather than a general election. Campaigners are calling for a second referendum The challenge for pro-referendum supporters is finding enough support in parliament. In April, when the government held a series of votes on the ious Brexit options, a second referendum was the most popular option but fell short of a majority, losing  to . Eventhe amendment passed it would not be a binding commitment to hold a referendum.Buta majority of lawmakers backed it, it would be hard to ignore and a big step forward for the long-running campaign for a second vote.

Phil and Vikki Kemp were unable to go on their luxury honeymoon to the Dominican Republic after consuming the treacherous food at their luxury wedding reception in Warwickshire. A pregnant mum and eight-year-old girl were among the  wedding guests struck down by the bug after the wedding in October  , reports Birmingham Live. Catering company Galloping GourmetLtd pleaded guilty to two breaches of health and safety at Cannock Magistrates Court today and were fined £, and told to pay court costs of £,. Mr Mark Jackson, prosecuting on behalf of Lichfield District Council, said the environmental health department was contacted by Mrs Kemp two days after her wedding saying guests had been complaining of suffering from gastric illness symptoms including nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pains. One man had been hospitalised.    Investigations traced the cause of salmonella from a hog roast which hadnapost been cooked to a temperature beyond  degrees which would have killed off salmonella. When environmental health inspectors visited the premises days later they discovered food out of date, mould in the fridges, and raw meat chopping boards were being mixed with other foods. Mr Christopher Russell, representing Galloping GourmetLtd, said: The company has no previous convictions and has a five star rating at its other nine sites. Further improvements and safeguards have been made to ensure this never happens again. The company would like to apologise for what happened to Mr and Mrs Kemp and their wedding guests. Kevin Grego, district judge, said: This had a devastating affect on Mr and Mrs Kemp on their wedding day. In total  guests were affected by salmonella poisoning. Records involving the hog roast were not proper, in fact fraudulent. The hog roast should have been heated to over  degrees but it wasnapost and this caused salmonella to be present.    In a statement released by solicitors Irwin Mitchell, Mr Kemp said: “The wedding had been a really fantastic day and everyone had enjoyed it so much but I couldn’t believe it when I started to feel unwell. It got to the point where I had to go to a local walk-in centre and after tests I was told I had salmonella – I just couldn’t believe it. “My illness lasted around  days all in all, but the symptoms were so bad that we had no option but to cancel our honeymoon to the Dominican Republic. I was totally devastated and we never got any money back from the tour operator or insurer in relation to it. “We did go away eventually, but this was obviously an extra cost on top of everything we had already paid. It was heartbreaking. Other guests affected by the illness problems have gone on to suffer issues including irritable bowel syndrome and psychological conditions as a result of what they have been through. Phil added: “News of today’s prosecution is very welcome and I hope that it is an outcome that caterers across the country pay attention to and learn from.

It is not known when the incident happened but it was uploaded to a Facebook page with the caption: Whereaposs the fair play here  It was filmed outside a Greene King pub called the Hunters Moon in the Hodge Hill area of the city. The clip shows a man in the yellow shirt being hounded by a group of men.    The man in the shirt takes his glasses off before the grey-haired man starts punching him in the face. The man takes the punches, shrugging them off, and walks out towards the car park as a pub worker desperately tries to stop the feud. He is then approached by a larger man in a tracksuit who starts punching the man across the face multiple times. Another hooded thug kicks the man from behind and punches him across the face which topples the man in the shirt, before two men punch him whilst he’s on the ground. One of the attackers screams in the face of the man after he gets up: “Listen you will f **  die! You’ll die bro. I promise you.

Bamber, , has found a phone log he says proves he did not shoot parents Nevill and June, model sister Sheila “Bambi” Caffell, and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas in August . Bamber is serving a full le tarf for the massacre at White House Farm in Essex. His legal team say a police record referring to a call made by Bamber on the night of the White House Farm massacre in  proves he was not there at the time and could form the basis of an appeal. They say it backs up the theory that Bamber’s sister Sheila Caffell, , murdered their parents Nevill and June, both , then shot her own sons, twins Nicholas and Daniel, six, before killing herself.    Bamber’s lawyer Mark Newby said: “The evidence strongly suggests the chain of events could not have been what the prosecution alleged.” The phone call evidence forms one element of a huge bundle Bamber’s team will soon submit to the Criminal Case Review Commission. The previously unseen police document appears to back up Bamber’s story that two calls were made to police on the night of the murders, one from his father and one from him after Nevill rang saying Sheila had “gone crazy”. At his trial, the prosecution said only one call was made to police – from Jeremy Bamber at .am from the crime scene, White House Farm in Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex. But the new document describes a call to police from Jeremy Bamber timed at “approx .am”. His legal team argue it shows Bamber could not have made the .am call from the farm and ed to his home . miles away in Goldhanger to make the second call.    The “.am” note came from an interview with a PC Myall, of Essex Police, during the Dickinson Inquiry into the force’s handling of the case after Bamber’s conviction in November . The note was found by Bamber among thousands of police documents released to him in . PC Myall is noted as telling Dickinson: “We received a telephone call at the P.Stn .The officerat CD Controlwas on the phone and told us that he was relating information to us and still had the informanton the other telephone.”  The trial judge had instructed the jury to disregard Bamber’s claims that he had called police from his home at .am. And prosecutors told the trial Bamber had invented the call from Nevill to lay the blame on schizophrenic Sheila, known as Bambi when she worked as a model. Bamber was convicted by a - majority of murdering his family to claim a £, inheritance. He was initially sentenced to five le sentences, to serve a minimum  years, but that was increased to a whole le tarf in . The Mirror revealed in  how lost phone logs showed it was Nevill who called police at .am.  A further record submitted to the Criminal Case Review Commission in  showed a .am call to police from Jeremy Bamber. But the CCRC ruled the .am call was noted in error and that there was just one call, from Jeremy not Nevill, made at .am from White House Farm scene. The new “.am” note is said to prove the existence of the second call. ITV last week announced a drama about the murders next year, with Freddie Fox as Bamber, who is in Wakefield jail, West Yorkshire.Bamber was famously pictured with girlfriend Julie Mugford, , struggling to contain his grief walking behind his parents’ coffins at their funeral. After Julie found he had cheated on her, she told police Bamber had talked of hiring a hitman to kill his parents.  A blood-stained silencer was also found at the farm by Bamber’s cousin. Bamber’s team say they now have evidence of two silencers examined by police, both believed to contain blood that could belong to Sheila or now-deceased cousin Robert Boutflour. They say a forensic report has been given to the CPS about this evidence. Bamber believes police always had evidence that would have cleared him, but failed to disclose it at his trial, his first appeal in  or second in . Between  and , Bamber made three CCRC submissions in a failed attempt to get his case back to the Court of Appeal. He has also made appeals against his whole le tarf.

If you didnapost want her then you should have kept your f***ing legs shut. People like you should have their jaffas sewn up so you canapost have no more. Youaposre [a] disgusting piece of trash. In response to the rude message, Ms Cowley wrote: Itaposs a doll [laughing face emoji].  So yes Rose, take your stinking attitude where and read the description before you go bumping your gums. Ms Cowley posted in a reborn dolls group asking for advice on how much to charge for baby Lavender - which has the same size and weight as a newborn - before listing it on Facebookaposs Marketplace. She said: I bought the reborn doll last Christmas for my daughter. With it only being  months old and hardly touched or played with, I decided to sell it so I could put it towards new gts for Christmas.

Describing it as the most horric day, the tragedy happened in  when the tired mum, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, fell asleep while feeding Arthur at night.When she woke up in the early morning hours, her baby was leless and nothing could be done to save the newborn, who died of sudden infant death syndrome , also known as cot death, DerbyshireLive reports.In the following days, she wouldto the hospital mortuary to cuddle his cold body, and she has since gone on to have another son.    Ms Woodruff is now appealing for parents not to co-sleep with their babies. She said: It was the most horric day and I felt asI were living in some kind of cruel nightmare.” None of it made sense or seemed fair. The ambulance ride on the way to the hospital was the most awful experience ever - by the time we reached Sheffield Childrenaposs Hospital, he was pronounced dead.    It was later confirmed that Arthur had died of SIDS, the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby. Arthuraposs death sent Ms Woodruff into a spiral with days that were dark and desperate. She said: The grief did strange things to me, but a few magical things happened to me in the following days. I went to see Arthur every day in the mortuary at the children’s hospital before his funeral.  My family members told me that I should probably stop going so much, and so I had a break for two days from visiting him and cuddling his cold body. I knew he was gone but I still needed to be near him. The mum said she will never get over Arthuraposs death, but in the passage of time she has found it possible to move on and come to terms with her grief. She said: It gets easier over time. But you should never expect to be your normal self right away.  Ms Woodruff told how she was overwhelmed with joy when Arthur was born and she saw his first smile. She said: I just couldn’t believe it. Most days I would just stare at him. It was love at first sight.” After the babyaposs death, family and friends supported her through the worst time of her le. She said: Arthuraposs dad was really good. I know at times I could get upset and act badly to those around me.  To the family and friends of someone who is suffering from this, try to understand that this person is upset and might not act like themselves. She has since gone on to have another boy, Henry, who is now aged two and the spitting image of his late brother. In that time she has come to think that her tragic experience happened for a reason and she has set out to support other parents and bring a warning to mums and dads. The NHS says more than  babies in the UK die suddenly and unexpectedly every year in a tragic phenomenon sometimes known as cot death. The term Sudden Infant Death Syndromeis used to describe the sudden, unexplained death of an apparently health baby, usually within the first six months of its le.The NHS infants born prematurely or with a low birthweight are at greater risk, and SIDS is slightly more common among baby boys. SIDS usually happens when a baby is asleep, which is how it came to be known as cot death. The NHS says there can be contributing factors, such as a parent smoking, a minor illness or breathing obstruction. There is also a link between co-sleeping and SIDs, and the NHS recommends not sharing a bed with your baby. NHS tips for ways parents can reduce the risk of SIDS:Do not smoke while pregnant or after your baby is born Do not sleep on a bed, sofa or armchair with your baby especiallyeither you or your partner smoke, drink or take drugs Do not let your baby get too hold or cold. The room temperature should be C-C with lightweight bedding Place your baby on their back while they sleep Let them sleep in the same room as you for the first six months Ensure their sleep environment wonapost cause your baby to become tangled in bedding Use a mattress thataposs firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition Place your baby in the feet to foot position with their feet touching the end of their cot, Moses basket or pram Keep your babyaposs head uncovered - their blanket should be tucked no higher than their shoulders Breastfeed you babyyou canIf youaposre worried about your baby at any point, see your GP or call NHS  for advice.

The legendary Mahendraparvata was feared lost forever, as scientists could not even agree where it was. It was hidden in dense jungle, but advanced aerial mapping has finally allowed its location to be identied after years of searching. But now experts say they can confidently state where temples and large palaces once stood, thanks to laser scanning. The city is thought to have been the first capital of the powerful Khmer Empire, which ruled over large swathes of South East Asia between the ninth and th centuries.    Its name means the Mountain of Indra, King of the Gods. Although archaeologists knew of its existence from ancient records, it has long eluded them because the terrain is so dficult. Exploring the area on foot has been incredibly dangerous because the evil Khmer Rouge, which ruled over Cambodia between  and , laid down landmines there. It was the location of the Communist regimeaposs last stand before it was finally defeated.    It is located in the Phnom Kulen highlands, around  miles north of Siem Reap. Damian Evans, from the French Institute of Asian Studies in Paris, told the New Scientist: The city may not have lasted for centuries, or perhaps even decades, but the cultural and religious signicance of the place has lasted right up until the present day. Even when it was the empireaposs capital, it was challenging for its inhabitants because it was so mountainous.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/l10031b4.jpg ","title":"exclusive rent increase on cards for dundees council tenants","story":"Council tenants living in Dundee can expect an inflation-busting rent increase of at least % next year under plans going out to consultation today.And Dundee City Council bosses have conceded that recent reforms to housing benefit means the rise is likely to have a negative impact on lower-income households.The administration will ask those living in local authority homes to choose either a %, .% or % rise to come into effect from April next year.The average increase on weekly rents would £., £. or £..Warden costs for sheltered housing are also set to increase by %, from £. to £..Draft papers seen by the Tele show that the % is suggested as the minimum needed to “deliver current levels of service”.But the consultation paper also warns: “Changes due to welfare reform may impact the amount you are paid .”Tenants will be able to give their views at consultation events throughout next month and December.

The expectation is high and you will get criticised and rightly so – I think people were entitled to have a pop at us after that performance and result.“It was a time for the players to look at themselves in terms of how we approached that game.“We showed a response against Hibs and certainly the way the game went with some decisions against us, a - draw with nine men wasn’t a bad result.“Before the game, with Hibs struggling a bit, we wanted to win the game.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the

Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved.

The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

provision of additional capacity at Ross High School.The latest plans are for  houses, with a further  one-bedroom flats.Fourteen business units would also be created on the site, as well as the bar restaurant and retail unit, which could be a shop.If approved, the plans would complete the wider site.David Forrest, chairman of Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council, said that the group planned to discuss the proposals at their next meeting, which takes place later this month.According to the plans, a total of  affordable homes ndash made up of the  one-bedroom flats, eight two-bedroom houses,  three-bedroom houses and two four-bedroom homes ndash would be created.The remaining private houses on the site, which would be accessed via Elphinstone Road, would be made up of  two-bedroom

proposals will likely be decided by East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee, which includes ward members Kenny McLeod and Colin McGinn.Both are limited on what they can say regarding the proposals so as not to rule themselves out of any future debate.Mr McGinn said: ldquoWhat is really clear is there is a strength of opinion out there about the amount of houses getting developed at

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant. And though itrsquos perhaps inevitable that some of the rebel Tories sitting on opposition benches might end up voting for the PMrsquos dealothers might decide to stick it to their former party and put the interests of the country first, especially since they are likely to lose their jobs anyway.

Would they be that stupid  I fear they would. It would be a cruel but perhaps not unexpected ironyLabour enabled a devastating hard Brexit to be foisted upon our poorest people.There is, as yet, no deal to put to parliament.

The UK Supreme Court had earlier ruled that secession was illegal, and that by supporting it, the Scottish Government, which has been disbanded, had committed a crime equivalent to a declaration of war against the UKThe European Union has refused to comment on the imprisonment of the Scottish nationalists. A Brussels official said it was ldquoan internal matter for the United Kingdom...Incredible  Fantasy  Of course. We donrsquot behave like that in Britain ndash at least we hope not. But thatrsquos exactly what has happened in Spain. For the first time since the death of the fascist dictator General Franco, elected politicians have been seized, tried and imprisoned, with draconian sentences, for the crime of democracy. For organising a peaceful referendum in .:Protests erupt as Spain convicts leading Catalan separatistsThe democratically-elected Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, is in Belgium fighting attempts by the Madrid state to extradite him. Nine Catalan politicians and independence activists have been sentenced in Madrid to between nine and  years for the archaic crimes of sedition and disobedience. The government of Catalonia, elected in a free and fair election, has been suppressed.The Catalan independence movement, like its counterpart in Scotland, has been entirely peaceful and democratic. Yet it has been subjected to some of the worst police violence seen in Europe for decades. Approaching , demonstrators were injured during the suppression of voting in . Another  independistas were injured on Monday.The European Union appears to have washed its hands of Catalonia. Brussels regards it as an internal matter. The outspoken Guy Verhofstadt, who has not been slow to comment on the ldquointernal affairs of authoritarian countries from Hungary to Hong Kong, has been silent on the most egregious violation of basic civil rights seen in Europe since the creation of the EU.The EU is supposed to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights. Its own Charter of Fundamental Rights includes, under Article , on political freedom: ldquothe right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association at all levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters.The imprisonment of elected politicians, who have never incited violence, is an offence against every citizen of the EU. These sentences should be overturned in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, and hopefully, they will be.But today there needs to be more than head-shaking by leaders of other EU countries. Politicians who routinely condemn Vladimir Putin seem unable to see the hypocrisy in failing to condemn Madrid. Liberal newspapers like theshow their ambivalence by reporting the fate of Catalan political prisoners as ldquoa warning to Scottish nationalists.Seriously  A warning of what, precisely  They are surely not suggesting that an unlawful Scottish referendum could result in anything remotely similar.:Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumWhat should be deeply worrying to the UK Left is that the imprisonment of the Catalan independistas has been condoned by the Socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez. The reason: he canrsquot interfere with the law of the land. One hopes that the silence from Mr Corbyn does not indicate any solidarity with Mr Sanchezrsquos rigid adherence to undemocratic laws.Indeed, Spain is a lesson for radical politicians in the UK not to place too much faith in the efficacy of Supreme Courts. Those at the SNP conference whorsquove been talking about pursuing independence through the courts should take note. The law is politics by other means, and Supreme Courts are supremely political institutions.The fact that Lady Hale gave Boris Johnson short shrt over proroguing parliament doesnrsquot mean that the Supreme Court is going to be kind to Scottish nationalism. In , the UK Supreme Court dismissed out of hand the Sewel Convention ndash the right of Holyrood to withhold consent to any laws passed by Westminster that cut across the powers of the Scottish parliament. When the chips are down, the UK Supreme Court will always see the integrity of the United Kingdom as its first priority.:Letters: The EU needs to help Spain and Catalonia find peaceThe same goes for Brussels. Ms Sturgeon has condemned the behaviour of the Spanish government, but she should also be making clear her discontent with the EU. Brussels is deeply ambivalent about state repression, whether in France against the Gilet Jaunes, or against the Catalans in Spain. Even when the UK is out of the EU, it is naiumlve to expect that Brussels will necessarily support Scotlandit comes to a constitutional breakdown with Westminster.These are dark times. All the more so because of the double standards of liberal opinion in the UK. We continually hear warnings about impending fascism in Britain. Columnists warn about the threat to democracy from Tommy Robinson, from Boris Johnson, from Brexiters. But here is real fascist repression taking place right now in one of the largest countries in the European Union.Itrsquos time for European governments to condemn this wilful regression to authoritarianism. The Spanish state should be diplomatically shunned by the British Government until it releases these political prisoners, just as countries like Russia are shunned. Madrid must be made to realise that this kind of repression cannot succeed.By reviving the spirit of Franco in st century Europe, Spain has squandered any sympathy for its centralist cause. It is legitimate to argue against Catalan independence it is legitimate to fight elections opposing it. But by breaking heads, dismissing elected governments and then imprisoning peaceful politicians, Madrid has acted in defiance of international law. And it has made the case for Catalan independence unanswerable."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A chance to make history but the Booker judges blew it","story":"I doubt the Booker organisers are so ecstatic. Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-scottish-housing-shortage-follow-eu-exit","story":"More than half a dozen councils in Scotland have claimed that house building targets and ongoing development could be in jeopardya No Deal Brexit were to go ahead.Loss of labour from the European Union, reduction in EU funding and increases in the costs of supplies used in property development could put plans to build thousands of new homes across the country at risk.Council bosses in West Lothian, Perth and Kinross and Edinburgh are among those who included the warning in their risk assessments ahead of the UKrsquos exit from the European Union.Housing association bosses in Scotland say that many programmes are currently on hold as questions remain over future funding, asking for the Scottish Government to come forward with a long-term commitment.:How a No Deal Brexit will affect me: Scottish councils fears for EU exit revealedSally Thomas, chief executive of the Scottish Federation Of Housing Associations, said: ldquoAt present, some social housing providers have put development plans on hold, because the Scottish Government is yet to commit to affordable housing investment after the current programme ends in .

The only highlight anyone mentions was the first successful shipment of frozen mutton from Australia.As for the Empire, well, there was trouble in Basuto ndash home, as you will recall, of the Basotho people ndash and the year ended with the outbreak of the Boer War and, shortly afterwards, the massacre of British soldiers at the Battle of Bronkhorst Spruit. I canrsquot think that being bayonetted in the Spruit would make anyone happy.On the political front, the Tory Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, retired. Not only was his gout getting him down but he remained distraught after the massacre of British soldiers at the Battle of Isandlwana the previous year .While British troops were happily being massacred abroad, William Gladstone became Prime Minister at home, after his EdinburghshireCampaign, which involved speaking to mass crowds in what passed as entertainment in pre-Downton days.Perhaps itrsquos a hangover from my school days that the name William Gladstone makes me come over all sleepy. You too  Well, wake up, readers, as I whisk us all forward to the year , which the same researchers say was, like, the worst year ever. This has caused a storm or mild breeze of protest from those who were there and loved it.There was the so-called Winter of Discontent, of course, industrial stre, rubbish piling up in the streets, yada and an additional helping of yada. On the plus side, a pint of beer cost less than p, England failed to qualy for the World Cup, and you could buy a hoose for, on average, pound,.Unfortunately, the following year saw the election of Margaret Thatcher and the ongoing triumph of the free market, with the result that the average cost of a house is now pound,. Mrs Thatcherrsquos election lted the national mood, it says here, and matters progressed merrily until, in the s, Britons were happily rioting in many towns and cities of Englandshire.I suspect that the trouble with a lot of such research is that the indices they analyse donrsquot stack up to a hill of beans ndash or reality, as I have also heard it described.One wonders what future researchers will make of , a year of fury and intolerance, caused by having no foreign wars to fight, a year in which the nation stood on the brink of enormous economic success after Brexit.Perhaps schoolchildren will start dozing over their books when the name Boris Johnson comes up.

No beans.However, we mustnrsquot titter. North Korea is a major nuclear player, and itrsquos thought the horse comes into the countryrsquos war plans, which involve First Minister Kim riding over to Canada then south to the American border, where he takes a nuclear bomb out of his saddle bag and flings it as far as his wee fat arms can manage.Then he says, ldquoHome, Fido!, and the horse s to NK, where terried officials reveal the disappointing news that his nuke was a damp squib.Still, itrsquos not every day you see a donkey on a horse.++++GOVERNMENT plans to make voters provide photo ID have caused consternation among me.Recently, Irsquod to shell out nearly  quid for a passport, when I havenrsquot been abroad for  years and have no intention of going. Been before. Ghastly place. You need to provide ID for so many things now, such as buying a wig oryou want brown sauce with your fish supper.I canrsquot think what help photo ID would be in stopping electoral fraud, which is already evident in the list of candidates. Who wants two votes anyway  British people find voting even once a terrible hindrance to their busy schedules.Yoursquod think wersquod have electronic voting now, but therersquos a risk of Kim Jong-un hacking the system so that we end up with him as Prime Minister.So, we trundle along to a church hall set up with trestle tables, from which hang stencilled posters with alphabetical directions. We take a pencil and mark a cross next to the least appalling candidate, fold the paper and put it into the slot of an old, scarred metal box.Itrsquos like stepping back into an episode of Dadrsquos Army. And thatrsquos how we like it. ++++DEATH has been in the papers again. This time, rioting erupted in several rural areas after Mr Motivator, the fitness personality off the telly, announced that he wants his ashes to be mixed into a fish paste, which would then be put into sandwiches for mourners to eat.Irsquoll be quite candid with you and confess that I cannot be bothered researchingMr M. actually said this or not. But it was on the front page of the Daily Star which, in a court of law, I would swear on before any bible.Mr Motivatorrsquos catchphrases include ldquoBe happy and ldquoGet wicked, which seem evidence of a confused mind. The latter is theologically dubious, while in reply to the former I would always say: ldquoNo.Still, there may be merit in this fish paste idea. At least nothing would go to waste. I suspect my ashes would probably give everyone appalling wind, and the sombre atmosphere I desire for commemorating my le would be ruined by raspberry sounds emanating from sundry nether regions.I wonderit would be possible to have my ashes inserted into Renniersquos tablets, which have been a great spiritual comfort to me over the years.Read more: Now thats what I call environ-mental"},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-snp-now-major-obstacle-independence","story":"At Westminster today, MPs will debate Boris Johnsonrsquos counterfeit deal to remove the UK from the European Union. The future direction of the UK, and with it the unavoidable consequences for our most disadvantaged communities, lie in their hands.Mr Johnson, at the behest of his puppet-master, Dominic Cummings, insisted on describing the Benn Act, which required him to seek an extension to the Brexit withdrawal date in the event of no deal, as the Surrender Act. The PM, though, has now produced the Surrender Deal, in which he has meekly relinquished the red lines of Theresa May, cheerfully defenestrated the Ulster Unionists, and coughed up a substantial orce settlement he once famously pledged never to contemplate.At any other time the SNP could put its feet up and enjoy the spectacle of Britainrsquos political establishment committing Seppuku. All that it would be required to do was nimbly avoid the ambuscades and dutully vote to reject the Johnson deal as being bad for the UK and Scotland. What should it matter to it whether Britain remains within the EU  It is pledged to leave the UK and the conduct of Britainrsquos most implacable Brexiters has helped its cause immeasurably. Independence having been secured, it could thereafter consult with the Scottish people about our future trading relationship with the EU. The SNP, though, seems intent on wasting the opportunities granted to its over the last three years and committing its own act of self-immolation.Its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has warned rebels within her own party of walking into a Unionist bear-trap. Perhaps she ought instead to be assessing the potential damage from the recent own goals contrived by her own party. The most lamentable of these has been the high-handed refusal by the party executive to entertain any semblance of a debate about an independence Plan B. This is exacerbated by its failure to produce a coherent tactical strategy for exploiting the Brexit convulsions of the British political establishment. It has also permitted a poisonous fringe of trans-gender activists to enter its bloodstream.The SNP womenrsquos group which emerged last week was formed partly as a response to the threats and intimidation many of them have recently encountered by trans-gender activists. Two of their guiding lights are Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry MP, committed feminists both and two of the brightest talents in the party. Simply for questioning the SNPrsquos official position on self-ID in the gender debate, they have been abused and bullied amidst moves to have them de-selected by a tiny but curiously influential group attached to the partyrsquos scarecrow youth wing.Entryism in the political sphere isnrsquot merely about pursuing a narrow agenda. It occurs when an unrepresentative group of people, in the face of overwhelming public rejection of their views, are happy to damage an entire cause and its chances of success in pursuit of these. In seeking to destroy the careers of some of the SNPrsquos brightest and best theyre doing much more damage to the prospects of independence than any Tory. They are enemies of the Yes movement.On Brexit, according to a rigorously scientic and wide-ranging Panelbase Poll conducted by the influential Yes website, Wings Over Scotland, a clear majority of the SNPrsquos own supporters oppose the partyrsquos Brexit strategy of outright opposition. This merely confirmed the wrinkles and nuances which the EU referendum produced among SNP voters in . The party needed to be adroit here, paying heed to the emerging view that Brexit will make independence more likely while not alienating the majority view among its own supporters who favour soft-Brexit above stopping it completely. Instead, the Holyrood leadership, where all power in the party resides, has performed a series of contortions to support a Peoplersquos Vote while also desperately seeking an early General Election for no other reason, it seems, than to avoid any collateral damage from the forthcoming trial of its former leader, Alex Salmond. The decision to crush all dissent over an independence Plan B is the culmination of three years of missed opportunities in the course of Brexit.The SNP commands all that it surveys in Scotland, an anointed position it continues to enjoy mainly because of the abject failures of leadership in the Labour Party in Scotland. Since , though, the main theatres of politics have been in Westminster and Brussels, places are populated by political royalty who can claim lineage to the English civil war and the origins of the Hapsburg Empire. They have been moving the pieces on Europersquos chessboard for centuries. To gain any idends for your cause you need to move among them and learn their ways. Mr Salmond was at home in this environment, making alliances and using Scotlandrsquos soft power ndash its scenery and natural produce ndash to make alliances and friends across nations and political boundaries.Itrsquos inconceivable that he would have allowed the Brexit chaos to pass without exploiting it in the cause of Scotlandrsquos independence. In this he would surely have deployed the considerable leverage of the SNPrsquos Westminster contingent to secure movement on a Section  order long before now. In these last three years though, the SNP has effectively split into two separate entities who barely acknowledge each other: Holyrood and Westminster. The Holyrood leadership are strangers to the men and women who control Europe and the UK, these shadowy puppet-masters who make things happen. Instead, shady chancers within the SNP ndash and known to the leadership ndash have been given licence to target Joanna Cherry, a politician who is widely respected in these circles. Misogyny and deep envy are at the root of this.After all of this the SNP is now, yet again ldquodemanding that a Section  order be granted. Just like that. Yet again it will be refused. And not for the first time you begin to wonder how sincerely it wants it. Twelve years in devolved government, with the virtual guarantee of another seven, is making some personal pension plans dance and stimulating the second-homes market on Scotlandrsquos wee bit hill and glen. Perhaps the partyrsquos new slogan ought to be: ldquoIndependence, but not just yet with a winking emoji.Read more: Sturgeon: SNP MPs will not back Brexit deal"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-wild-west","story":"BILLY Connollyrsquos latest book, a collection of his most popular stand-up material titled Tall Tales and Wee Stories, was released this week.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has issued a safety reminder after a number of maritime distress flares were dumped at St Margaret’s Hope household waste and recycling centre.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-. Of the ship#s  crew members — many of whom were very young men —  were lost.For more coverage of the events taking place around the anniversary of the sinking of the ship, see this Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They insisted they were just doing their job after years of training. President Donald Trump put in a congratulatory call from the White House to mark “this historic event ... truly historic.” “What you do is incredible. You’re very brave people,” Trump told them as they wrapped up their spacewalk. Meir replied: “We don’t want to take too much credit because there have been many others - female spacewalkers - before us. This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time ... For us, this is really just us doing our job.” NASA leaders, Girl Scouts and others also cheered Koch and Meir on. Parents also sent in messages of thanks and encouragement via social media. NASA included some in its TV coverage. “Go girls go,” two young sisters wrote on a sign in crayon. A group of pupils held a sign reading “The sky is not the limit!!”Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a three-time spacewalker who looked on from Mission Control in Houston, added: “Hopefully, this will now be considered normal.” America’s first female spacewalker from  years ago, Kathy Sullivan, said it’s good to finally have enough women in the astronaut corps and trained for spacewalking for this to happen. “We’ve got qualied women running the control, running space centers, commanding the station, commanding spaceships and doing spacewalks,” Sullivan said earlier this week. “And golly, gee whiz, every now and then there’s more than one woman in the same place.” NASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring, but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go until summer. Koch and Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week, but had to venture out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. It was the second such failure of a battery charger this year, puzzling engineers and putting a hold on future battery installations for the solar power system. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine watched the big event unfold from Washington headquarters. “We have the right people doing the right job at the right time,” he said. “They are an inspiration to people all over the world including me.” The world’s first spacewalker on March , , Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, died last week. NASA astronaut Ed White became the first US spacewalker less than three months after Leonov’s feat. Women did not follow out the hatch until .

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England.

Those without a passport or drivers# licence would be able to apply for a free #local electoral identity document#.But Mr Hughes said: #When millions of people lack ID, these mooted plans risk raising the drawbridge to huge numbers of marginalised voters – including many elderly and BAME [black and minority ethnic] voters.#The ERS estimates the scheme would cost £m at each national election and Mr Hughes believes there are bigger threats to democracy that should be tackled first.#The government have sat on their hands in the face of the actual threats to electoral integrity: anonymous #dark ads#, dodgy donations and disinformation. Instead of taking on the real issue, they are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.#Make no mistake – these plans will leave tens of thousands of legitimate voters voiceless. Ministers should focus on combating the real threats to our democracy, rather than suppressing voters’ rights. raquoI am shocked! Yes, shocked! By Alistair Carmichael‘s lack of understanding on why this piece of legislation has been put forward. The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in Europe, and in fact the world,that doesn’t require some form of identication when an election is taking place. However, in light of massive electoral fraud in the West Midlands and the South East of England, particularly in local government elections, the current administration has decided to tighten up the rules it is long overdue. Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Greece all require either a national ID card or a utility bill or bank statement as proof of residency which, especially in the case of Greece, have been necessary. Australia and Israel, and certain states within America have also tightened up the rules due to similar issues with fraud. None of the above measures have prevented honest citizens from exercising their democratic rights.The UK remains a country with low levels of voter fraud and the majority of the recent alleged voter fraud in the Midlands related to postal and proxy votes which voter ID at the ballot box will do nothing to solve.Carmichael an obstacle to democracy , says Anderson.#The government have sat on their hands in the face of the actual threats to electoral integrity: anonymous ‘dark ads’, dodgy donations and disinformation.

Typically dark , with intricate patterns, thebird is dficult to spot with the naked eye during the day. However, once aerial, with its buoyant but erratic flight, this bird is most conspicuous.One of those who had the opportunity to view the bird last week was RSPB site manager, Brad Robson.He said: “It really is a fantastic bird. It sits on branches during the day and then at night it flies about hunting insects.“To see a Common Nighthawk is very rare indeed in fact it is the first one recorded in Northern Ireland. There have been sightings in Ireland on just a couple of occasions.”Its appearance in Ballymena has generated huge interest with bird watchers coming over from the UK to see it.Brad went on to explain that the bird is likely to have ended up in Ballymena due to the recent Storm Lorenzo.He said: “The Common Nighthawk breeds across North America and then they migrate to warmer parts of South America.“During that migration some will fly out over the coast. However, when you get these big powerful weather systems which you see across the Atlantic at this time of year some of those birds can get caught up in the storms. They are then whisked off across the Atlantic and one of their first landing stops can be Ireland.“When a bird is travelling in a weather system it cannot feed so the faster the weather system is across the Atlantic the more chance of it surviving the journey. Some birds will often rest on ships, however, that is unlikely to be the case with this bird.”Brad said that whilst the sighting in Ballymena is “very rare” the storm did bring a some American birds to Europe, causing a lot of excitement among bird watchers.He added: “It was great to see the Common Nighthawk flying about hoovering up the insects and I think everyone there was pleased to be able to see it so easily.”According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The common nighthawk measures . to . inches long and displays a wing span of to  inches. During migration, common nighthawks may travel , to , kilometres . According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range is one of the North Americas longer migrations. The northbound journey commences at the end of February and the birds reach destinations as late as mid-June. The southbound migration commences mid-July and reaches a close in early October.While migrating, these birds have been reported travelling through middle America, Florida, the West Indies, Cuba, the Caribbean and Bermuda, finally completing their journey in the wintering grounds of South America, primarily Argentina.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"decision due on casement in month","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has said that a decision on the planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park could be reached in the next month.The £ million redevelopment plans had previously faced setbacks due to safety concerns linked to the size of the stadium.Planning permission was granted for a , capacity stadium in , but in  approval was quashed in a High Court legal challenge brought by Mooreland # Owenragh Residents’ Association .New plans to build a , capacity Casement Park were submitted by Ulster GAA in February .Mr Maskey, who recently met with planners at the Department for Infrastructure , said that, while some information regarding the decision was still outstanding, a decision on the application is imminent.“The department are still waiting on some information coming back to them from DFI roads,” he said.“Obviously when they get that back they’ll have to go through that with due diligence.“When they get that information, which should be within the next month, then hopefully they will be able to make a decision. I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided. So once they get that information from DfI Road they should make that decision without delay.”Meanwhile MORA has written to the DfI Planning to object to the new stadium proposals.The letter, which has been seen by the Andersonstown News, states that “Further Environemtal Information” provided by Ulster GAA in July “fails to allay” concerns about development of the stadium “to an oversized capacity”.The residents’ association insists that the redevelopment would have “unacceptable impacts” on people in the area including “excessive over-shadowing and loss of daylight”, air pollution, as well as “noise, disturbance and safety issues” should proposals for three major concerts a year at the stadium be given the green light.“In addition, the applicant has been unable to demonstrate that the road network can safely handle the extra vehicular traffic that would be generated by sporting and concert events,” the letter reads.“The applicant’s proposals for safe evacuation, which now extend to the Stockmans Lane roundabout, also give rise to serious concern and demand for more rigorous scrutiny.”A spokesperson for Ulster GAA said: “Within its planning application, including its Further Environmental Information submission, Ulster GAA has comprehensively addressed all factors relating to the stadium’s operations and impact, with the Safety Technical Group having unanimously supported the project plans.“As the stadium plans are currently under consideration by the Department for Infrastructure it would be inappropriate to comment further on the live planning application.”The Safety Technical Group comprises representatives from Sport NI Belfast City Council, the PSNI, the NI Ambulance Service the NI Fire and Rescue Service Sports Grounds Safety Authority and the GAA’s ground safety management."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"playboy as relevant today as it ever was","story":"One of the most iconic plays of Irish theatre has been reimagined for our times and received a standing ovation at the Lyric Theatre during its opening night.Running until November , JM Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World tells the story of Pegeen Mikewho is tired of her le, working in her father’s pub in a small village in rural Ireland, where she isbetrothed to the dull Shawn Keogh, only for stranger Christy Mahonto walk into her le with a story that sets the whole village talking.While all the women in the village have their heads turned by Christy, whose dark secret makes him all the more attractive, the playboy’s past threatens to catch up with him and it surely does.First performed in , the play is as fresh today as it was when it caused riots in Dublin on its opening night.

Previously on August , there was an arson attack at a tyre company owned by Tony Lunney in Ballyconnell.In the letter the QIH chairman was critical of the response to the continuing violence and warned of the boards fears that the escalating violence \"will result in serious injury and or loss of le\".In the letter, Mr Barden wrote: \"Minister, it would be a gross failure of the States justice systemdeath or serious injury were the yardstick for State intervention to protect its citizens against persistent criminality.\"One can only speculate that this situation would not be toleratedthese attacks were perpetrated against the senior executives of FDI led companies such as Microsoft or Apple.\"As a major employer the safety of our  staff in this border region remains our priority at a time when management time should be focused on the impact of Brexit for our operations on both sides of the border.\"The letter finishes with a request to meet the Commissioner: \"Given the serious issues involved the Board have requested me to arrange an urgent meeting with your office and the Garda Commissioner at your earliest convenience.\"The letter was sent by email cced to Irish enterprise minister Heather Humphries who represents the Cavan Monaghan constituency, as well as the Commissioner.

The publication was produced by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division .The report details how a “large enclosure” was uncovered within a housing development off the Skeoge Link Road in the Ballynagalliagh area of Derry. It was located on a relatively steep, south facing slope.The enclosure was constituted of  post holes with  posts forming a separate arc in the north-west corner of the site. The majority of the post holes were of considerable size, with half of them producing broken bits of pottery, also known as sherds, within their fills.Some of these have been identied as belonging to the Vase tradition of Bronze Age pottery and other sherds have been identied as coming from the Cordoned Urn tradition. The general date provided for the use of the site is – BC.A substantial rectangular Neolithic house was identied at Turmeel townland, Co. Derry during the archaeological investigation of the A road near Dungiven.It measured approximately m long and m wide and contained almost  sherds of Neolithic pottery. The building was constructed during the period when farming and agriculture were introduced almost , years ago.At the Glenshane Road near Claudy a Late Neolithic ritual site was discovered during a quarry extension. This consisted of a timber circle – large wooden posts with an outer fenced forecourt – which dated to circa  BC.Timber circles are likely to have been the focus of elaborate ritualised activities attended by large numbers of people.HED Senior Archaeologist Andrew Gault said: “These excavations have resulted in exciting and important new information about our past, from evidence of the homesteads of some of the first prehistoric farming communities in Northern Ireland to more recent urban archaeological remains and industrial heritage.“It is intended that ‘Unearthed’ will continue as a regular annual bulletin of the most signicant archaeological discoveries arising from development-led archaeology in Northern Ireland.”Discoveries in other parts of the country include a Bronze Age roundhouse at Rasharkin solar farm. It consisted of a post-ring, an internal heath, areas of stakeholes, and a segmented enclosure.Enclosed houses generally date to the Middle Bronze Age, c.  BC. Finds included a possible rubbing stone and several sherds of Late Bronze Age coarseware pottery.An th th-century tannery, a place where animal hides are tanned, was discovered within the centre of the site at Royal Exchange in Belfast. This site is located within what would have been the th-century core of the city, an urban industrial operation where leather would have been produced commercially.This was represented by a series of  tanning pits, the majority of which were constructed of wooden planks joined together by wooden dowels.Mr Gault concluded: “These new discoveries highlight the importance of archaeological mitigation in advance of development, as well as the signicant contributions made by developers and archaeologists in unearthing these new archaeological sites for the benefit of all in society.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Excavated Enclosure at Ballynagalliagh in Derry."},{"url":null,"title":"broomsticks ready spellbinding halloween fun foyleside shopping centre","story":"Feeling frightful about what to do this Halloween  Fear not, as Foyleside Shopping Centre has plenty of spellbinding family activities to keep you spooked from this Saturday th right through to the st October.To be sure to terry the whole family – there will be an array of ghoulish Halloween games, chilling treasure hunts and “‘”trick or treat’” challenges to sink your vampire teeth into.Or you can unleash your inner beast by mucking in for the monster soft clay workshop.Why not quench your bloodthirst with chocolate apple and pumpkin decorating  Oryou’d rather rise from the dead for the occasion, visit our professional Halloween makeover and face painting stalls!

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences. Online bullying and exam pressure have all contributed to rising levels of anxiety and stress.ldquoIt is important we equip and educate our young people to deal with these issues and to look after their mental health.ldquoThere is support and help available for young people and their families and I urge them to avail of these services.Following talks delivered by young key note speakers, pupils discussed their views on the stresses and anxieties faced by young people.Participants were facilitated in small groups to share their thoughts and generated ideas to help develop support within their schools.Among those taking part were Kori Colgan-Murphy, a GCSE student at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, who has been a member of the schoolrsquos Gender Sexuality Alliancegroup for a number of years.ldquoThe GSA is open to all students including LGBTQ students and their allies, she said. ldquoIt is a place where students can come together to socialise, discuss issues, and support one another.Paul Collins, campaign fundraiser with the Integrated Education Fund, said: ldquoSchools in Northern Ireland have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people with mental health issues.ldquoThese could be anxiety or panic attacks, stress and depression, eating disorders and even, as we sadly know suicidal thoughts.ldquoThe aim of this conference is to provide an open environment to listen to children and young people.ldquoTeachers and parents need to find out what mental health issues are affecting young people in order to provide them with access to the right type of support.ldquoOn the basis of the group discussions, we hope to develop and deliver a plan that can help to address the mental issues impacting on our young people and their wellbeing..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Dads.jpg","title":"Dads helping autistic children enjoy their favourite sports with new project  ","story":"FOOTBALL is often a rite of passage sport for many young boys and girls but for children with autism, taking part in mainstream clubs or school activities can be overwhelming.Two local fathers are trying to make participation a lot easier and stress-free for their children to enjoy this team sport.Gerard McCartan and Daniel Craig from Downpatrick are just two of the many fully involved members of Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.They have been taking a group of  local children aged between six and with autism for a specially adapted football course for the last three weeks at the Ballymote Sports and Wellbeing Centre.Devised by Gerard, who works for Disability Sport NI, the course aims to build skills in incremental levels in a way which focuses on enjoyment.Gerardrsquos eldest child Cahaacuten, , has autism and was diagnosed just before he went to primary school. He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials. One of the issues which has arisen is the number of classes it can host and the number of people who can be accommodated in each.Council officials are going to examine the issue, alongside extending the hugely popular leisure centrersquos opening hours.In addition, they are also going to focus on expanding the health referral service which enables GPs to refer people to the leisure centre to engage in fitness-related activities.Over recent months, the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Department has been liaising with the Public Health Agency and local health trusts to look at helping address key areas including diabetes prevention.New staff are to be appointed with the posts jointly funded by the health trusts and local authority.

To allow school use of the pool the running costs would jump from pound, to pound, and receipts would only normally be expected to rise by pound,, leaving an additional deficit of pound,.Negotiations are currently in progress with the South Eastern Education and Library Board but councillors are clearly determined not to allow school use unless the Board agree to pay the additional pound, deficit.If the Board agree to pay for school use the pool will open each morning, otherwise it will be open only in the afternoons and evenings.The councilrsquos recreation committee has already accepted a timetable for pool openings and have agreed to open doors from .pm to .pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursday and Fridays.On Wednesdays it will open from .pm to .pm for public use and will re-open between .pm and .pm for the use of recognised swimming clubs.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Business and Professional Womenrsquos Club have written to South Down MP Enoch Powell in connection with the proposed changes in immigration procedures.The club, having been informed through the United Kingdom Federation of B and P Clubs, who were told by Baroness Lockwood of the Equal Commission, want action taken before the proposals are passed by the government.The proposals, that British women wishing to marry foreigners will have to live abroad whilst British men will still be able to marry foreign girls and live in Britain with them, were discussed at greatby the meeting, before it was decided that the secretary should contact Mr Powell.The guest speaker at the clubrsquos recent meeting was Mrs A Nixon, who gave a talk on lsquoHow to be a Good Hostessrsquo.ARDGLASS mdash Ardglass Castle has been put on the market and the asking price is around pound,.The castle, which is believed to have been built in the th century, has  bedrooms and it is thought that one of its guests was the famous songwriter and painter Percy French.Many believe that the talented Frenchman painted several views of Ardglass harbour from the Castle.Other interesting guests, this time more recently were an order of monks who stayed in the castle in the late s and early s.The current landlords, Sean and Bernadette Tracey, and their three children are sorry to be leaving the castle. Sean had ideas to convert it into a hotel and restaurant and there is already planning permission for such a venture.The Fermanagh-born hotelier is moving his interest to another establishment although this time he is tight-lipped about its whereabouts.Sean is aware that most castles are expected to have at least one respectable ghost and he admits that there are many stories locally about ghosts in the castle but during his time living there he never heard had any experience of them.ldquoAlthough the premises are licensed for spirits mdash I think they are of a dferent kind, he

Ballygowan goat enthusiast Jim Gibson has begun a campaign to improve the standard of Irish goats.Jim has started his pedigree herd with the importation of British Alpines from the herds of Mr and Mrs AE Hall and Mrs AEW Hunter, of Norfolk.ldquoThere are no other Alpines in Northern Ireland at the moment, yet I believe them to be the best breed of goal, and I am making plans to import other early in the new year, said Jim.ldquoThese will again be dferent bloodlines as a follow up to the making of a small but very well bred herd.ldquoCrossed with our own native goals they will produce a very tough healthy race of goats capable of yields upwards of two gallons, which is certainly well worthwhile.Jimrsquos present stud goat, Swaffham Salvador, was a reserve champion out of an entry of  goals at the Royal Norfolk Show.Jim has also imported a Soanen male whose dam was a Q Star goat breed champion.His other stud is a British Soanen bred over a gallon of milk with a minimum fat content of % in less than  hours.ldquoOne of the big markets has come from the growth of health food shops who are creating a demand for goals milk, said Jim.In charging pound stud fees, Jim believes that it is a reasonable charge mdash when you take into consideration he is bringing in the animals at a cost of pound a goat, including quarantine fees.DUNDRUM mdash Outspoken Castlewellan councillor Ethel Smyth was involved in another head-on with local councillors this week over the controversial player fields at Dundrum.Mrs Smyth has raised the Dundrum site at numerous council meetings and has repeatedly attacked the attitude of councillors and of chief public health officer, Mr Frank Nixon.The site has been used for indiscriminate dumping and Mrs Smyth has called many times for council action because of a public health nuisance.On each occasion she has met with protest from a number of councillors, notably Dundrum councillor Mr Jarlath Carey, who has repeatedly defended Mr Nixonrsquos role and also that of Dundrum Sports Committee who own the site.Mondayrsquos debate dfered little with Mrs Smyth repeatedly her allegations and with councillor Carey, joined by councillor

The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

It was crazy. Amber was born in her whole sac, she continued.ldquoI did what the midwives told me to do because she was in the water [the sac]. I was already in early labour when I went for a hospital appointment but while they wanted me to stay, I said that I would rather go back home as I wanted to do everything as natural.ldquoThey advised me not to come back in until my waters broke but they didnrsquot break. I came back around .pm and Amber was born two hours later.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered.

Not content with being a part of an iconic Down team, Eamonn was a man who was committed to giving back.ldquoHis club in Bryansford benefited and in more recent times he was prepared to put himself forward to take charge of the county team for three years and pass on his knowledge to a new generation of Down players.ldquoOn and off the field he was a great ambassador for our Association and we join our Mourne County colleagues and Gaels in lamenting his loss.Tributes have also been paid by former Down GAA legend Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty who referred to the late Eamonn Burns as ldquoa true legend because of the person he was.Doherty said: ldquoWhat very, very few people know is that in the build-up to one of the All-Ireland finals mdash I wonrsquot say which one mdash Eamonn was quietly nursing an injury. But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him. He just cared about the county. Itrsquos hard to believe that we will never see him again.Bryansford GAC mdash the Down manrsquos home club mdash which flew its flags at half mast following his passing mdash described Eamonn as ldquoa true legend of both club and county while Down GAA described him as ldquotrue son of Down.They said: ldquoEamonn has been taken from us too soon, we will miss you Eamonn but we will smile in the memory of the days that you gave us.Last Sunday, Eamonn Burnsrsquo sons Cathal and Thomas led the Down  team onto pitch in memory of father ahead of senior football final between Warrenpoint and Kilcoo at Pairc Esler, Newry. The poignant moment the day after the Down GAA manrsquos funeral took place before throw-in on Sunday with rapturous applause for the boys and the Down team.In addition to his sons, Mr Burns is survived by his we Sinead, brothers Colm and Malachy, sister Mary and family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Twinning.jpg","title":"Twinning group visits French host town  ","story":"NINE members from the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group recently visited their host town of Lamorlaye in France to mark the st anniversary of the successful partnership.Lamorlaye mayor, Nicholas Moula and his deputy, Yasmine Chani, welcomed Newry Mourne and Down Council vice-chairman Terry Andrews and the visitors from Ballynahinch.A busy programme was organised by the French hosts over the weekend, which was centred around the annual ldquoFete Du Cheval or Festival of the Horse.The twinning arrangement between Lamorlaye, Chantilly and Gouvieux, was initiated mainly because of this equestrian link between the two regions.Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group chairwoman, Karen Patterson, said the group was given a guided visit of the race horse training tracks where animals the animals are exercised.ldquoWe were also welcomed by a leading race horse trainer at her stables in Lamorlaye, she continued. ldquoWhen we arrived at the castle and lake of Lamorlaye, we were given a welcome drink and treated to a performance of French accordion music.ldquoAfter a short lunch, the party was treated to a fantastic piece of street theatre, performed by the Horsemen ndash a group of three talented comedians, who delighted the audience in the town centre with their comedy act in Franglais, a mix of French and English.The twinning group chairwoman explained that when the official part of the evening ended, the visitors were introduced to their host families before an informal dinner in the White Horse restaurant.The living horse museum in Chantilly was the venue for the grouprsquos next excursion where they were teated to a dressage show in the Royal Stables and had time to visit some of the exhibits on display.ldquoAfter a busy day, we enjoyed a Moroccan Algerian meal before making our way to the castle at Lamorlaye to view an exceptional sound and light show. The acts included opera with performers on horseback.ldquoThe horses were retired race horses which had been re-trained to perform in this show. There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17944401.children-get-back-nature-convention-share/resources/images/10562870.jpg","title":"bandstand adam doherty","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whatrsquos the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Do you have any gigs coming up Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

For some reason I recall a middle aged woman in the packed crowd wearing a DUP , ,  sticker.The concept of giving Dublin a say in NI at a time when it was perceived to be doing little to stop a long terrorist campaign, was easy even for a teenager to understand.Yet I have only fully come to grasp the AIA’s signicance decades later, both the long-term intentions of the signatories, UK Ireland, and its impact.It also took a while to see what its signing said about the preceding failures of unionist leaders, and what the response to the AIA said about loyalism’s declining power.Not infrequently in  we report on developments that have their origins in , such as the recent episode in which the Taoiseach visited Hillsborough Castle without being hosted by a Secretary of State, days after the NIO advisor, Lord Caine, who had always insisted on such accompaniment, was not kept on his post.Despite the inappropriate circumstances of his visit, Leo Varadkar then used British state property to publicly attack a UK government that was not there to defend itself.As is the enduring pattern of NIO and British weakness in the face of such relentless Irish partisanship, London stayed politely silent in response to this subtle over reach.A well connected Westminster figure tells me that unionism, whatever its present dficulties, is in a better position than , when it had few friends in the House of Commons, hence why NI MPs were unaware of the coming Thatcher volte face.Kate Hoey: The Brexit plan ides the UK, so I will not be voting for it todayLord Empey: The Union is not safe in the DUP’s hands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"There are now younger Tory MPs who grew up through the Troubles, or older ones who served here, who instinctively view NI as British.Another dference between the AIA and Boris Johnson’s u-turn is that two years ago, in the  backstop, London made clear its determination to avoid an Irish land border, so we have had time to get used to the risk of a sudden, forced Irish Sea one.But even so, there are key similarities with .In both cases, the climbdown was by two Tory prime ministers who had used emphatic language in defence of their full support for Northern Ireland’s undiluted place in the UK .In both cases, the number of Conservative MPs who were prepared to support unionists in defiance of their own prime minister was miniscule. In , a mere  Tory backbenchers rebelled against the AIA, out of Mrs Thatcher’s vast parliamentary reserves of almost  Conservative MPs.Today, we do not know how many Tories will reject the Boris Johnson Brexit plan, but it is expected to , or fewer than that, and not even all of them will do so on the basis of their support for the Union.This does not mean that Conservative MPs in  or today have been disinterested in the Union. To an overwhelming extent, they support it. But, when under pressurethere is only so far they will go to the wire to protect it.Both votes,  and today, also reflect a fundamental truth that no unionist should ever forget: our numerical near insignicance within the United Kingdom.Even the derisory Tory rebellion of  MPs in  is greater in number than there have ever been Northern Ireland unionist MPs, in any one Parliamentary session.Unionists are around .% of the population of the UK, and about .%of the population of the EU.There was only so long that unionist concerns were going to be allowed to hold up the might of Europe in its desire to strike a deal with a major nation state, the UK. But this latest political abandonment of unionists involves a factor that was absent previously: the views of Middle England.Middle England’s view of Northern Ireland has, perhaps mercully, never been put to the test before.It had not been asked whether or not it wants Scotland or Northern Ireland until the Scottish independence referendum of . I was alarmed by polls that showed % of English people wanted Scotland to stay. It was cited to encourage Scots to vote to remain in the UK, but it was in fact quite a lowish level of southern solidarity.Recently there were surveys that found that in a choice between Brexit and the Union, more people in England would choose Brexit.Parliament is sitting today, and last sat on a Saturday in  for the Falklands war. A task force was sent halfway across the world to defend almost uninhabited islands.The Troubles then was ongoing, and had been for  years, and would persist for another decade. Around , British servicemen were killed in the Falklands and NI, yet the UK public never rebelled against that sacrice.Now the population of England, which makes up the great bulk of the UK, and its establishment Tories, seems willing to make constitutional concessions over UK territory, on a scale that was resisted for decades despite relentless violence, all on behalf of a cause — Brexit — that had little traction a few years ago outside a eurosceptic fringe.As to the merits of this deal, I am still trying to absorb it. Respected pro Union voices including Lord Trimble, Ruth Dudley Edwards and the Spectator magazine think it is a good compromise for NI. Perhaps so. But it is a massive turning point in British history that will take decades to assess. I think, overall, it is a bit better than Theresa May’s deal. Yet there is no disguising the fact that soon we are likely to have a major, and probably permanent, internal border in the Irish Sea, something no other nation on earth would allow to ide its territory.Five years ago most unionists would have found that prospect unthinkable and appalling.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"our single goal has been to secure the best possible brexit deal for agriculture ufu  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Our single goal has been to secure the best possible Brexit deal for agriculture: UFUUlster Farmers Union president Ivor Ferguson.

Claims to have uncovered conspiracies involving the UFU are just plain wrong. We are all aware of the consequences of political failure, but not only are we not the cause, we are not even a remote part of the equation.“Our interests are firmly focused on what is best for the future of farming families. We have no control over how others choose to use our position for their ends.Not to have spoken out about a no-deal outcome and the catastrophic impact it would have on family farm businesses would have been a huge disservice to our members.” Mr Ferguson continued: “Brexit was never going to be easy. Unpicking the UK’s  plus years relationship with the EU is a huge challenge.It demands compromise from both the UK and EU. Despite claims by some that are wholly wrong, we have always called for a solution that allows farmers here unfettered access to the GB market, while maintaining long-standing trading relationships between NI and ROI. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “We represent , farming families with erse views and political affiliations. It is unrealistic to expect our members to agree on everything. Brexit is a contentious issue, and people’s view are not based solely on whether or not the EU delivers for farming. “We were clear from the outset that we would not tell our members how to vote. But we also said we did not see a compelling argument that farming would fare better outside the EU. We have robust, logical, democratic processes to establish positions on issues, and Brexit has been extensively debated through those processes.“Since the referendum result our single goal has been to secure the best possible Brexit deal for agriculture.

Part of the street was bombed in World War Two and only these few old houses remain. We learnt that the house is going to be torn down in the near future.“We ended up sitting in the neighbours’ house having tea. The hospitality has been amazing. This trip was to make Dora May’s dream come true. It’s been even more.”Her eldest son Steven said: “As a family we’ve often done cruises in the past, but this is a very special trip because we’re going back to our roots. It’s been an emotional five days.”Unable to make the trip this week were Dora May’s daughters Susan and the late Janet and sons James and Andrew.Her son Mark commented: “Some of us have a really strong interest in coming back. The people here take great pride in their beautul country.” Given that Hannah Mary had a lot of brothers and sisters who stayed in Northern Ireland the family are hopeful they may have more relatives here.

The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
