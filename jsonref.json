Now lovers of contemporary art can join the fun by tracking down shimmering, thought-provoking sculptures in a London park.Frieze London art fair has installed its first augmented reality artwork. “No shipping, no installation costs,” said its director, Victoria Siddall. “It is interesting for us to be able to test the boundaries of what sculpture can be.”From Tuesday, visitors to Regent’s Park will be able to track down large hovering ice slabs that are artworks by the South Korean artist Koo Jeong A. They are only visible on mobile phones through an app.Daniel Birnbaum, the director of Acute Art, which commissioned the artist, said three editions of the work had been placed around the park. “It looks just as realistic as the sculpture next to it. If you take a photo of it or you send it your friends, they will not be able to tell whether it is real or virtual,” he said.The work, titled density, is both entertaining and philosophically interesting, he said. “I like the fact that we are introducing this object, this entity, into the most conventional and classical of environments – a royal park with statues.”Acute Art is like a contemporary version of the 1960s organisation Experiments in Art and Technology, which encouraged collaborations between artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and John Cage and engineers.“Their mission,” said Birnbaum, “was to see what happens if the most important artists of the era get access to new technological tools to make things they would not have been able to”.Acute Art gives artists access to virtual and augmented reality, an area still in “the stone age”, he added, but things are changing fast.The augmented reality artwork was announced before the Frieze London and Frieze Masters art fairs in Regent’s Park in the first week of October.The 2019 edition will be the most global fair yet, Siddall said. “We have galleries from 35 countries from all over the world, we are welcoming new galleries from the Philippines, from Latin America, from Asia, and really it feels like a celebration of London and how welcoming and international a city it is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9aca340e35037089039903801610276467c37ec/175_1370_2703_1621/master/2703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2deec75f97265cf07451487eb395e43","title":"the polaroids of linda mccartney in pictures","story":"Before her marriage to Paul McCartney, Linda McCartney (née Eastman) was known for her rock portraits: in 1968 she became the first woman to shoot the cover of Rolling Stone.

Sirius Minerals plans to grind polyhalite into a powder to produce pellets with the commercial name Poly4 - or K2SO4MgSO42CaSO42H2O for short.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat’s so good about it?Poly4 contains four of six key minerals that plants need to grow – potassium, sulphur, magnesium and calcium – making it ideal for use in agricultural fertiliser. Sirius says it is cheap to produce, certified for organic use and offers high crop yields.Sirius thinks it has a 290m tonnes of recoverable polyhalite, which it could start mining in 2021 and continue exploiting for 100 years, up to a maximum of 20m tonnes per year.The Woodsmith Mine project, which involves building a 23-mile-long underground conveyor belt to take the mineral to Teesside for export, could deliver £100bn of economic benefits to the UK over 50 years, according to Sirius.About 1,200 current employees are at risk if the project is cancelled, while Sirius estimates that once up and running, the mine would support around 2,500 high-earning jobs in an area suffering from economic deprivation, as well as benefiting hundreds of local people who bought shares in the company at an early stage.“We’ll continue to have an open dialogue with government and there may be a structure that they find acceptable that does balance the risk and reward to the taxpayer,” Fraser said.Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar, criticised the decision not to provide financial backing for a project she said would bring jobs to the region.A government spokesman said he could not comment on commercially sensitive matters but that “all requests for financial support must meet necessary lending criteria”.“When examining any request for financing, we have to assess the potential of a project against the need to protect taxpayers’ money,” he said.Fraser said lack of state support had exacerbated “soured” conditions in the bond markets caused by factors including uncertainty about investment in the UK amid the ongoing turmoil of Brexit.“The main factors related to the current status of the bond market, uncertainties around Brexit and the political situation in the UK,” he said.“Those are two very strong negative winds to go against when you’re trying to raise multi billions of dollars for a project like this.”Success in securing the extra money from new bond investors would have unlocked a conditional $2.5bn finance package agreed with Wall Street bank JP Morgan.Without it, the company now has approximately six months before it runs out of cash to fund its operations.Fraser said the company was now looking for alternative investors and could turn to a sovereign wealth fund, large fertiliser companies or a major mining group.However, he said he does not expect to receive any further funds from Australia’s richest woman Gina Rinehart, the mining magnate who has invested $250m in the Woodsmith Mine project via her Hancock Prospecting company.Graham Spooner, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: “With cash running out fast, investors will be fearing for the future of the mine and remain cognisant that the recent history of mining in the UK has been littered with failures.”Investors include tens of thousands of small shareholders, including local people in North Yorkshire who have been captivated by the ambitious plans and the prospect of huge returns on their investment.Sirius has agreements in place with potential customers to buy up to 13.3m tonnes of Poly4 a year over five to 10 years and claims the global market for it is more than 30 times that size."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/915707d4557705cfc6d55024204e222696e75cb0/0_416_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aa08ea9390c84c9e8654058d363c5c5","title":"the guardian view on worker ownership plans firms for the many not the few","story":"The French economist Thomas Piketty presented a simple explanation for rising inequality.

Media lab director Joi Ito resigned.Stallman’s emails came to light after an MIT graduate, Selam Jie Gano, published a Medium post calling for his removal.According to the Medium post, Stallman wrote in response to a student’s message about an event protesting the acceptance of Epstein’s money. The emails, which were published by Vice were sent to a CSail mailing list.Referring to Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who alleged in court papers she was sent to have sex with the late MIT cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, Stallman wrote: “We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing.“Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.”When a student on the email thread noted that Giuffre was allegedly forced into sex at 17, Stallman responded: “It is morally absurd to define ‘rape’ in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.”“We know that Giuffre was being coerced into sex – by Epstein. She was being harmed. But the details do affect whether, and to what extent, Minsky was responsible for that.”Minsky died in 2016, aged 88.Stallman, 66, has contributed to the . On Monday he posted a statement to his website before his resignations were made public. Reports about his views on Epstein were “misleading”, he said.“The coverage totally mischaracterised my statement. Headlines say that I defended Epstein. Nothing could be further from the truth.“I’ve called him a ‘serial rapist’, and said he deserved to be imprisoned. But many people now believe I defended him – and other inaccurate claims – and feel a real hurt because of what they believe I said.“I’m sorry for that hurt. I wish I could have prevented the misunderstanding.”On Monday MIT Media Lab academic Neri Oxman apologised for “having received funds from Epstein, and deeply apologize to my students for their inadvertent involvement in this mess”.Harvard received $9m from Epstein prior to his 2008 guilty plea to state-level prostitution charges in Florida.Epstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself in jail last month while awaiting federal sex trafficking charge.Prosecutors alleged that some of his victims were as young as 14."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56beb1b86231704aec32a52813936bfe85bd8145/0_22_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d27f5debf5ffa3984e7c1f8ed7e53c3","title":"parents spot toxic school headteacher nightmare workplace staff","story":"When choosing your child’s new school, consider whether it might be a nightmare workplace for the staffThe banners are up, the adverts are in local newspapers. No sooner has the autumn term begun than schools are recruiting the next cohort of students. If it sometimes seems that they all say the same things about their engaging curriculum, personalised pastoral care and professional ethos, how can you tell them apart?For some parents, it’s all about outcomes. Which school tops the league table for results? Which has been judged by Ofsted as outstanding? For others, it’s more about a culture that will suit their child. Is there a mobile phone ban? Does the school have the dreaded isolation booths?But there is also another consideration. In the same way that consumers are becoming more ethically driven when it comes to the working conditions of those making their clothes or harvesting their food, some are now wondering about how their child’s teachers are treated. So how can you tell whether a school is “toxic”?Just to reassure you, there are not many toxic schools out there. However, it is undeniable that a few have an ethos where staff are worked to the bone, made to complete unnecessary tasks, and are not treated with respect.Miserable and exhausted teachers are unlikely to be as effective as they could be. Teaching is tough but not every school seeks to improve conditions for staff. I wouldn’t want my children taught in such an environment, even if whipping their teachers leads to better GCSEs.I’ve known victims of toxic schools. If I could handpick a teacher for my children it would be my friend Sylvia every time. Sylvia ended up in a toxic school. Meetings were called for 7am as well as 7pm emails demanding immediate actions arrived at all hours, at weekends and during holidays. Her head of department came into her year 11 lesson and announced to the students that if they failed, it would be Sylvia she blamed. The principal never once spoke to her. When she spent hours putting up a beautiful display of student poetry, she was told she’d used the wrong colours and it had to be taken down immediately. Sylvia ended up having a breakdown and quit.It also happens to headteachers. When Rob’s mum died, within six hours of her death his chair of governors had emailed three times wanting to know when he’d be back and whether he could finish the report he was writing by the next day.By the time of his mum’s funeral a week later, the chair had phoned 17 times and sent 50 emails, not one offering condolences. It was the last straw after years in a toxic academy trust. Rob walked away from a school where he was dearly needed.Does this matter to you? And if it does, what are the signs?Look carefully when you visit. Are the senior leadership team visible? Are they talking to children and parents? Are they talking to teacher colleagues, or keeping to themselves in a huddle? How do the teachers interact with one another around the building – do they seem respectful, happy and positive? Don’t necessarily dismiss schools where teachers look tired – teachers are nearly always tired and the back-to-school bugs will have hit.I’ve heard that triple marking helps children. Do you do that here?Triple marking – or excessively remarking work – does not lead to better outcomes but is an indicator of excessive workload expectations.How often will I see marking in my child’s books? Although we are conditioned into thinking lots of marking will improve outcomes, it is not the case. Regular feedback, much of which is oral, makes a difference. Many schools trying to reduce workload and improve teacher wellbeing have ditched written marking altogether.How often will I find out how my child is doing? It is reasonable to expect updates a couple of times a year and one or two parents’ evenings any more is an indicator of excessive workload.Are there many new staff this year? Sometimes schools may need staff turnover to keep things fresh, and it is sometimes necessary to move on underperforming staff. However, a regular high turnover may indicate unhappy staff.What do you do on Inset days? This may provide an insight as to how valuable the staff find the professional development on offer. Are Inset days used to lecture them and berate them about results? Or do they get time simply to get themselves organised? With what kind of enthusiasm do they speak about their experiences?I work long hours so I might have to email you at about 8pm – when would you be able to respond? Don’t expect responses immediately – within 24 working hours is fine. Lots of schools are encouraging staff to remove work email from their devices and set time limits during evenings and weekends.What do you think about the head’s vision? Staff who feel involved in a shared mission tend to be happier. Teachers completely at odds with the direction of the school are unlikely to feel settled, involved and happy.How long have you worked here? Are you likely to stay for long? Whether a teacher has just joined or been employed for years, the way in which each inidual responds will give you an impression about whether they feel as if they belong and are looked after. The caveat is that even after 30 years of experience, I’m not sure I could walk through the door of a different school and be able to identify whether it was toxic or not. Adopting the air of a concerned but unknowledgable innocent can disarm those you speak to. Bear in mind, though, that even if their responses raise a red flag, the school may still be a happy place to work. You may never know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df0bf655a8e44bd0fcc3b86bfd8fa43445229a7f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ae3da88fc2d094cf40bcc69404d511","title":"us academic given two weeks pack up after eight years visa system researchers","story":"Visa system for researchers is hostile and costly and risks jamming a pipeline of talent, universities warnAfter eight years researching music history at Glasgow University, Elizabeth Ford hoped her request for a visa extension would sail through this summer. Instead, the Home Office gave the American academic two weeks to pack up her life and leave the country.Ford has held a research fellowship at Edinburgh University – which, like Glasgow is in the elite Russell Group – and is due to begin a new research fellowship at Oxford University. But this is in jeopardy after a letter from the Home Office in July, which said that her leave to remain, granted a year before, was erroneous, and that she must leave within two weeks.Ford, an expert on 18th century Scottish music history, who says she loved Scotland from the moment she first set foot there, says: “After eight years I had 14 days to get out. It was truly shocking. I have never felt so unwelcome or so offended.”Ford’s case adds to a growing storm over the visa system. While the government has announced plans to offer two-year work visas for international students, nothing similar has been offered to researchers from abroad, who say the process is hostile, cumbersome and punitively expensive. University leaders say the situation could block the talent pipeline to the UK.Ford is refusing to leave her home in Glasgow and has been strongly backed by Scottish MPs, including Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader. She has consulted immigration lawyers who say she has a case to appeal on human rights grounds.She came to Glasgow to do her PhD under a student visa, then obtained a doctoral extension visa for a year. The research fellowships she has won since do not come with a fixed employment contract, so a charity sponsored her last visa applications. “The visa system in the UK is completely arcane and arbitrary,” she says. “It is focused on high income and nothing else. But it is unrealistic to expect newly minted PhDs to find a permanent academic job with a high salary. It just doesn’t happen.”Prof Roibeard Ó Maolalaigh, vice-principal and head of the college of arts at Glasgow, says Ford is a “valued colleague” and the university is very supportive of her application for a visa extension. “This case has caused considerable distress to Dr Ford, especially as it would appear that the issue was caused by an error at the Home Office,” he says.However, it is not only academics who have had their visas refused who are unhappy. The cost of applying for a visa has increased considerably in recent years, and many young researchers are struggling to pay the fees. Dr Jana Bacevic, a sociology research associate on a part-time contract at Cambridge University, earns £1,200 a month. Last month she was horrified to hear that she had to pay £1,500 to cover the costs of extending her visa for a year while she looked for a permanent academic job. She tweeted: “You know what UK? Good night and good luck. I used to love this place with all its flaws, but hey, there are universities on the continent too.”Gareth Edwards, an Australian who is a senior lecturer in human geography at the University of East Anglia, says: “If I was arriving today as a fresh postdoc I couldn’t finance it, especially with a family.”He says junior academics are hit hardest as they are often on short-term contracts and have to reapply for their visa – and pay thousands again – every time their contract is extended or they move jobs.One young Indian academic, who asked not to be named in case it prejudices his future visa applications, says the costs felt overwhelming, coming to Liverpool University from Mumbai with his wife and baby. “I had visa costs of around £2,500. We had to use my father’s retirement savings,” he says.Shamit Shrivastava, a post-doctoral research associate at Oxford University’s Institute of Biomedical Engineering, has had to reapply for his visa every year since he arrived in 2015. He says he is lucky because Oxford, unlike many other universities, pays the fees. But he still usually ends up spending hundreds more on the premium service each year to speed things up, because, typically, applications take two and a half months to process, meaning he could not work.“When I first applied, the programme I was working for had the funding to employ me for at least three years but I was only given a one-year visa. It is very stressful to have to go through it all again every summer,” he says.Shrivastava adds that to take out a loan or rent a flat for 12 months you need a visa of at least a year. This means that even a month after his paperwork is finalised, he is ineligible. “I only manage because I have a wife who is employed, but colleagues have really struggled with this,” he says. “The system leaves you with a feeling of helplessness.”Martin Smith, policy manager at the Wellcome Trust, says UK visa costs for scientists are more expensive than competitor countries “by a long way”. The charity has also collected around 100 examples of cases where scientists wishing to come to the UK for conferences have had their visa declined unfairly. “These are disproportionately from lower-income countries, especially in Africa,” he says. “They are told they do not have sufficient finances, even if the trip is fully funded.”Smith adds that the suspension of parliament means that the immigration bill making its way through Westminster has died and will need to be reintroduced in a new session. The trust is worried that there is no clarity about what the government intends to do on immigration. “It’s not reassuring for researchers right now,” he says. “For people thinking about moving their lives to another country it is an enormous decision. “The current immigration system is so bad for science that unless we get some real clarity and improvement, talented people will drift away.” A spokesperson for the Home Office says: “We welcome international academics and recognise their contribution to the UK’s world-leading education sector. All immigration applications are considered on their inidual merits and on the basis of the evidence available.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de672eb5b32edd9076b19854e230af180dffef2b/0_169_5249_3153/master/5249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=909b7cd68a6473070848c52624498179","title":"air pollution particles found on foetal side of placentas study","story":"Research finds black carbon breathed by mothers can cross into unborn childrenAir pollution particles have been found on the foetal side of placentas, indicating that unborn babies are directly exposed to the black carbon produced by motor traffic and fuel burning.The research is the first study to show the placental barrier can be penetrated by particles breathed in by the mother. It found thousands of the tiny particles per cubic millimetre of tissue in every placenta analysed.Damage to foetuses has lifelong consequences and Prof Tim Nawrot at Hasselt University in Belgium, who led the study, said: “This is the most vulnerable period of life. All the organ systems are in development. For the protection of future generations, we have to reduce exposure.” He said governments had the responsibility of cutting air pollution but that people should avoid busy roads when possible.A comprehensive global review concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. Nanoparticles have also been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and billions have been found in the hearts of young city dwellers.The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, examined 25 placentas from non-smoking women in the town of Hasselt. It has particle pollution levels well below the EU limit, although above the WHO limit. Researchers used a laser technique to detect the black carbon particles, which have a unique light fingerprint.In each case, they found nanoparticles on the foetal side of the placenta and the number correlated with air pollution levels experienced by the mothers. There was an average of 20,000 nanoparticles per cubic millimetre in the placentas of mothers who lived near main roads. For those further away, the average was 10,000 per cubic millimetre.They also examined placentas from miscarriages and found the particles were present even in 12-week-old foetuses. The first report of possible pollution particles in placentas was presented at a conference in September 2018, though the composition of the particles had not been confirmed.The detection of the particles on the foetal side of the placental barrier means it was very likely the foetuses were exposed, Nawrot said. Work to analyse foetal blood for particles is now under way, as is research to see if the particles cause DNA damage.The team also found black carbon particles in the urine of primary school children. The study, published in 2017, found an average of 10 million particles per millilitre in hundreds of nine-to-12-year-olds tested. “It shows there is translocation of particles from the lungs to all organ systems,” said Nawrot.“It is really difficult to give people practical advice, because everyone has to breathe,” he said. “But what people can do is avoid busy roads as much as possible. There can be very high levels next to busy roads, but just a few metres away can be lower.”Children and babies’ developing bodies are most at risk from toxic air, with 300 million living in places where toxic fumes are six times above the international guidelines.\u0026nbspA comprehensive global review found that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. It causes issues from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body, and from ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream.In the UK, while deaths attributed to air pollution have halved in the last four decades, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution. One in 20 deaths in the UK is still attributable to small particle pollution alone.Prof Jonathan Grigg, whose group presented the first report of particles in five placentas in September, welcomed the research and said the group’s work had since been expanded and would be published soon.“We see evidence of particles in all women – it is not like it is a one-off,” said Grigg at Queen Mary University of London in the UK. “It implies that every day we have these very small particles moving around our bodies.”Air pollution research now shows full scale bodily harm, from heart and lung disease to diabetes and reduced intelligence to brittle bones and damaged skin. The WHO calls air pollution a “public health emergency” and recent analysis indicates 8.8 million early deaths each year, though scientists suspect even this may be “the tip of the iceberg”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/475632d16661eb15040149dbe270a9cd6b9e9948/0_342_5242_3146/master/5242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af217a807128e7eddb9e554673e119b5","title":"london fashion week springsummer 2020 20 key shows in pictures","story":"This season saw a heady mix of schedule regulars as well as up-and-coming stars – with a focus on sustainabilitySo hot it hurts: London fashion week in the age of climate activism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1000c67f642a8b0e49aedc486bc216ea9b264c95/210_116_1563_938/master/1563.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f84e85fb810f9aff48dd344bd494305","title":"mauricio pochettino tottenham champions league olympiakos","story":"Mauricio Pochettino has waited three and a half months for this moment. At various times, particularly in the weeks that followed Tottenham’s Champions League final defeat against Liverpool on 1 June, the club’s manager has been beset by frustration and regret.To many on the outside – and possibly even some of those on the inside of the squad that Pochettino has assembled – it was a once-in-a-lifetime shot. And it went begging. The hard truth was that Spurs never looked like winning in Madrid, even though Liverpool were below their best.The only way to forget is to rebuild, to enjoy fresh adventures, and Pochettino made the point that he could hardly have picked a better place to begin the healing process and his fourth Champions League campaign with Spurs than Olympiakos’s Karaiskakis Stadium – one of the wildest, most atmospheric venues on the continent. “I am Argentino,” Pochettino said, with a smile. “I love to play in this atmosphere, when the fans are tough.The run to the final last season came as a surprise, not least because they were on the brink of elimination numerous times, and there is the sense that few people fancy them to go all the way this time. Pochettino’s message is one of realism and yet, at the same time, he knows what is possible when everybody is pulling in the same direction.It was put to Pochettino that with three key players in the final year of their contracts – Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Christian Eriksen – it could be this team’s last hurrah. He does not doubt their commitment.Pochettino’s mood has improved since the closure of the European transfer window and there was a freedom of expression from his team in Saturday’s 4-0 home win over Crystal Palace. Previously, there was encouragement in the 2-2 draw at Arsenal and, piece by piece, momentum is being built, which Pochettino hopes to maintain against Olympiakos, even with a changed lineup. The manager feels compelled to rotate as he addresses the second of seven games in 21 days he has left Serge Aurier and Danny Rose in London.Olympiakos had to make it through three rounds of qualification to reach the group stage after finishing second in the Greek championship and their record in all competitions this season is eight wins out of nine, with one draw and only one goal conceded. They remain without their leading striker, Kostas Fortounis, who is injured, but Pochettino and the Spurs captain, Hugo Lloris, said they were wary of the threat posed by the French forward Mathieu Valbuena.It is about what Spurs do and a positive start would be welcome. Pochettino joked that he would sign for a repeat of last season, when they took one point from the first three group ties and still went on to make club history, but it is sometimes forgotten that they qualified for the last 16 only after Internazionale failed to beat PSV Eindhoven. Pochettino wants to leave nothing to chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c92f1dc99e1e34a0800f97963ccaa3263469e2b/0_0_2364_1418/master/2364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e02d2ed7548345d1ae28cc6e806a3d1e","title":"chelsea v valencia champions league live","story":"41 mins: What a ball from Kovacic! And a miss from Willian! Pedro passes to Kovacic on the left, with Abraham in the middle and Willian not properly marked behind him. Kovacic has to check back onto his right foot, a delay that seems to end their advantage, but then he makes up for it with a spectacularly good pass that loops over the defender and straight onto the Brazilian’s boot. He collects, but then blooters his shot over!40 mins: Willian goes on a lovely run from inside his own half into Valencia’s penalty area, but then he hits a poor pass to the overlapping Azpilicueta. Goal kick.37 mins: Now Alonso crosses from the left and Abraham, in his desperation to get on the end of it, accidentally volleys Gaya. Free kick.36 mins: Tomori gets into the area, tries to pass to Abraham, collects the rebound and finally shoots wide enough that it almost turns into a decent cross to Azpilicueta to the right of goal, but the bounce is unkind and the move ends with a goal kick.35 mins: Willian, Chelsea’s No10, skips past Parejo, Valencia’s No10, hares towards the area and then shoots low and hard, just beyond the left-hand post.33 mins: Jorginho is in the book, after launching himself at Kondogbia. It was almost the opposite of Coquelin’s caution, in that he hardly made any contact but the challenge was misguided enough to be worth a booking of its own.30 mins: Valencia have the best chance of the game so far! It ends with a very decent shooting chance for Rodrigo, just outside the area, but his effort hits Gameiro and bounces away.26 mins: Valencia meanwhile have awoken, having been dormant for the first quarter-hour. They ping the ball around the edge of Chelsea’s area, but as soon as they get inside it they lose control, and it rolls through to Kepa. 22 mins: Chelsea break, and Willian carries the ball forward on the right while Pedro sprints into acres of space over to the left. He goes unspotted, and the chance is wasted.20 mins: Valencia’s first attack ends with the ball being chipped through to Gaya, running from deep beyond the defence. His effort is saved by Kepa, and he was anyway offside.19 mins: Elsewhere in Group H, Ajax have taken the lead at home to Lille. Quincy Promes with it.17 mins: After Saturday’s wonderstrike there are cries of “shoot” whenever Tomori gets the ball, no matter how far from goal he is. He ignores them, and instead the ball is chipped up to Abraham, who handles it in trying to control. Free kick. 16 mins: Mount looks extremely unhappy to be leaving the field, but leave it he must. He walks off unaided, though, and Pedro replaces him.14 mins: Mount is still limping, but perhaps not for long: Pedro appears to be readying himself.12 mins: Chelsea are looking very comfortable here, with Willian particularly sprightly.11 mins: After lengthy treatment, Mount limps on. Willian takes an optimistic and pretty hopeless shot from the free kick.9 mins: Coquelin gets an early booking. I’m not sure it was intentional, but in following through after clearing the ball he planted his studs deep into Mount’s ankle. I don’t think he meant it, but the contact was pretty ugly.8 mins: Chelsea swing the ball into the area, again from the right. It’s a poor cross and goes straight to Wass, but he makes an absolute reeking howler of his clearance and very nearly tees up Abraham, forcing Kondogbia to throw a leg out to desperately intervene.6 mins: Chance for Chelsea! A nice move down the right ends with Azpilicueta bursting to the byline and crossing to the near post, where Abraham sidefoots into Cillessen from an unpromising angle. Then the resulting corner is headed goalwards, but it’s more easy work for the goalkeeper.4 mins: Jorginho hits the ball over the defence and into the path of Abraham, but it bounces through to Cillessen.3 mins: The ball enters a penalty area for the first time, though it’s a Chelsea back-pass so no danger. There might be soon, though, the home side having somehow converted it into a Valencia throw-in in short order.We’ve had anthems and handshakes, and are currently enjoying the coin toss. There’s very little now standing between us and kick-off.The players are in the tunnel, and football is about to be played!This year’s Champions League group stage ball (there’ll be another one for the knockout rounds) is extremely colourful. Apparently it’s “a bold multi-coloured design incorporating traditional colours from the Uefa Champions League as well as those seen across stadiums worldwide”. I think “colours seen across stadiums worldwide” pretty clearly means “whatever colours we fancied”.Frank Lampard speaks very quickly. Here’s what he’s got to say about tonight’s formation - he’s sticking with the back three that served him so well at Wolves at the weekend.I want us to be adaptable. I want us to be able to change. We did at the weekend. It doesn’t mean that’s the way we’re going to stay.This is the fourth time tonight’s referee, Cuneyt Cakir, has taken charge of a match at Stamford Bridge. In positive omen news, Chelsea have won two and drawn one of the previous three. It is his first Valencia away game, though he was in charge of their 3-2 home win over Genoa in the Europa League a couple of weeks shy of a decade ago.That’s just one change for Chelsea: Zouma is in, the injured Rudiger is out.Here are the teams again in text-based form, for anyone who can’t see embedded tweets:Team news is in, and it looks like this:And here are Sid Lowe’s reports on last week’s managerial axe-swingery in Valencia:Football club and all-round basket case Valencia are today’s visitors to Stamford Bridge, still reeling from the sacking of Marcelino García Toral less than a week ago for the crime of not-much-really. In came Albert Celades, former Spain Under-21 manager, with the club’s president, Anil Murthy, saying one of the reasons behind the switch was the fact that “Valencia must defend its philosophy of promoting young players who have come through the academy, and give them the opportunity to compete at the highest levels. The kind of player that has grown with the club since they were children and truly represent our values. They are the foundation of a team that must balance the club’s ambitions with a long-term sustainable model.”Well, that sounds familiar. And in his very first game Celades helped one brilliant young player to make the headlines, although unfortunately the player involved, Ansu Fati, played for the opposition. Valencia lost 5-2 at Barcelona, 16-year-old Fati scored one and assisted another, while the visitors fielded five players aged 30 or above and only three below 25. Some work to go with the whole young-player thing, then. On the very same day in Wolverhampton Chelsea were also involved in a 5-2 scoreline, although they had the best of it at Wolverhampton. It’s been a very promising start for Frank Lampard and his band of merry tykes, even if they are yet to keep a clean sheet, and this certainly has the potential to be another forward step even if there is strong anything-can-happen potential.Celades is a fan of the 4-3-3, though is widely expected to stick with his predecessor’s 4-4-2 until he’s had a bit more time on the training ground. Still, with Chelsea playing 4-3-3 for most of the season (albeit they went with a back three at Molineux) perhaps this would be a decent day to unveil the big switch.Anyway, and without further ado, hello! Here’s Jacob Steinberg’s pre-match preview:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/547f5b6f325bca32c2af50a77b96c17fc909a546/0_98_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ee862de5d6e2c9e81c8bcb2a29ecc50","title":"napoli v liverpool champions league live","story":"41 min: Koulibaly concedes a free-kick in the channel between the Napoli penalty area and the left touchline after catching Sadio Mane with a stray arm. Nothing comes of it.40 min: Fabian Ruiz sends a teasing cross into the Liverpool penalty area, where Virgil van Dijk does just enough to prevent Hirving Lozano sliding in and poking it goalwards.37 min: On Monday’s Football Weekly podcast (available free in all the usual pod places) I said that Liverpool’s front three are practically impossible to defend against, but Napoli are doing a very good job of keeping them at bay tonight. The Italian side’s goalkeeper, Alex Meret, has only had one save to make so far and must be mightily reassured by the sight of the two-man portcullis that is Kalidou Koulibaly and Kostas Manolas in front of him. 35 min: Liverpool go forward after a sustained spell of possession from Napoli, but once again the Italian side’s defending is stout and they fail to make much ground.33 min: Insigne gets the ball caught under his feet under pressure from Alexander-arnold in the Liverpool penalty area. With a better first touch he might have fashioned an excellent scoring chance in that position.32 min: After just over half an hour, its scoreless but excellent fun and I have Napoli winning very narrowly on points.31 min: The ball finds its way to the feet of Mertens on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area, but Sadio Mane gets in his way before he can pull the trigger.29 min: Hirving Lozano tries to pick out Mertens with a cross from the inside left, but his delivery is blocked and loops up into the air and into the warm embrace of Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian. Some very promising attacking play from both sides is being thwarted by some outstanding defending from both sides.28 min: Dries Mertens fouls Trent Alexander-Arnold as the pair of them sprint after a loose ball in the Liverpool penalty area.26 min: Good defending from Joel Matip, who stoops to head the ball behind for a corner, after Dries Mertens had whipped in a cross and Lozano was waiting to pounce from six or seven yards out. Nothing comes from the set piece. 24 min: Virgil van Dijk gets across to dispossess Dries Mertens, who’d been put into space by a pass from deep in behind Andy Robertson. Corner for Napoli, which Van Dijk clears.22 min: Mo Salah drives into the Napoli penalty area and gets goal side of Koulibaly, who resists the temptation to bring the Egyptian down. Running down a blind alley, Salah picks out James Milner on the edge of the area and the midfielder shoots high over the bar.20 min: Napoli are piling forward at every opportunity, giving Liverpool plenty of opportunities to attack on the break. The first quarter of this game is being quite some lick and Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret is pressed into action for the first time, getting down to save a Sadio Mane shot from a tight angle at his near post.16 min: At the other end, Virgil van Dijk is on hand to block an attempted cross to Hirving Lozano from Insigne on the left wing. Moments previously, Liverpool were forced to clear their lines as Ruiz squared the ball into their penalty area with Mertens lurking. Van Dijk it was, who cleared.15 min: A rock in the heart of Napoli’s defence, Koulibaly steps up again, this time to block an attempted cross by Trent Alexander-Arnold. 14 min: Napoli win a throw-in deep in Liverpool territory, then another. Now they win a corner, as Milner puts the ball out of play rather than let Giovanni Di Lorenzo get past him on the byline. Nothing comes of it.13 min: Another good tackle from Koulibaly, who gets back to dispossess Mo Salah as he tried to jink past the defender after being played into the Napoli penalty area by Fabinho.12 min: Kalidou Koulibaly es in to dispossess Roberto Firmino with a perfectly timed tackle in the Napoli penalty area and earns himself a loud roar of approval from the home fans.10 min: Lorenzo Insigne runs on to an excellent pass from deep into the penalty area by Allan, but Trent Alexander-Arnold reads his intention and is first to the ball. 8 min: Chance! Chance! Chance! Fabian Ruiz shoots twice in quick succession from about 15 yards out, his second effort a follow-up saved by Adrian after the goalkeeper had parried his first back into the midfielder’s path. Lozano nods home the second rebound but is correctly flagged for offside. That’s a fairly impressive double-save from Adrian, who is making his Champions League debut in goal for Liverpool.6 min: Dreis Mertens tries to pick out Hirving Solano with a curling cross from the right, but Joel Matip heads clear. 5 min: Liverpool break down the field on a counter-attack, which breaks down when Salah is unable to pick out Sadio Mane with a pass. Allan, one of Napoli’s central midfielders, intercepts with a crucial block. 3 min: Liverpool win a corner after good work down the right from Mo Salah. As the ball sails into the penalty area, Kostas Manolas catches Roberto Firmino with an elbow and the Brazilian goes to ground but the referee blows for an offside. That looked like it should have been a penalty to me, but the VAR officials don’t appear to agree. 2 min: The fans are a long way from the pitch in Napoli’s throwback of a stadium, which didn’t have functional dressing-rooms this time last week due to renovations that didn’t finish on time. They are, however, making plenty of noise. 1 min: There’s a slight delay as referee Felix Brych appears to deal with some technical issue with his ear-piece before play gets under way. Not long now: The teams line up in the tunnel and make their way out on to the pitch led by referee Felix Brych and his team of match officials. Napoli’s players wear light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue socks. Liverpool’s players wear red shirts, shorts and socks. Jurgen Klopp speaks: “The game plan?” he says to BT Sport’s dishy, debonair pitchside reporter Des Kelly. “The opponents line-up is very offensive. It will be tricky, it will be lively ... it will have to be very intense. We’ll have to be brave with the ball and first of all defend them. We have to adapt in the game, but the best way is if we have the ball and pass it around.” The Liverpool Echo report that a number of Liverpool fans were attacked in Naples this evening. Some had bottles thrown at them by home fans, while others were surrounded by men on mopeds and whipped with belts.“We were just trying to have a quiet drink before going to the apartment and had just paid our bar bill,” one supporter, who did not wish to be named, told the Echo.“Next minute we could see about 10 scooters flying down. They slowed right down and their faces were covered with scarves and helmets. Next second they are jumping off swinging belts towards us. Must have all happened in 90 seconds but some lad got hit by a belt. Twice I’ve had bother here now. I am never coming back.”Merseyside Police have since released a statement. “We can confirm two Liverpool fans were reported to have been assaulted in Naples earlier today” it read. “At around 6pm local time (5pm GMT), it was reported a number of males on scooters approached the fans at a bar in the city before assaulting them.“Two men from the UK, aged 26 and 46, sustained superficial cuts and grazes to the head and were treated at the scene before continuing to attend the match.“Local police are aware and Merseyside Police are working with police colleagues in Naples to assist in the policing of the Champions League fixture tonight.”Team news: Andy Robertson has been passed fit to play in a Liverpool side that features three changes from the side that started against Newcastle on Saturday. Jordan Henderson and James Milner come into midfield, with Gini Wijnaldum and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain making way. Roberto Firminho comes in for Divock Origi and will make his 200th appearance for the club.Carlo Ancelotti has picked a very attacking Napoli side, with Jose Callejon, Dries Mertens, Lorenzo Insigne and Hirving Lozano all starting. Defender Kostas Manolas and midfielder Allan are also drafted in as Nikola Maksimovic, Piotr Zielinski and Elif Elmas drop out. Despite fronting up for last night’s press conference, Fernando Llorente starts on the bench, as does Arkadiusz Milik, who can’t seem to decide whether or not he’s fit to play.Carlo Ancelotti speaks: “Liverpool have improved because winning the Champions League gives you belief,” said Napoli’s manager. “We have improved too though and we’ve bolstered our squad with the addition of some quality players. I think it will be a great game – hard fought and intense.“We want to play a starring role, first by reaching the knockout stage and cementing our place as one of Europe’s top clubs. We know how good we are and we want to prove it on the international stage.“We mustn’t alter the way we play, regardless of the team I pick. Of course you have to keep the opposition in mind and the defensive side is very important but if you want to win matches you have to impose your game by playing to the strengths of your players.”Jurgen Klopp speaks: “If you go nuts and start taking drugs and drinking and driving different cars or whatever, and leave your missus at home because you are now the Champions League winner then I can’t help you,” he joked, upon being asked if victory in the Champions League last season had gone to his players’ heads.“We don’t feel the burden of being champions,” said Liverpool’s manager. “It was long ago. Will teams play differently against us? I have no clue. I’ve never won the Champions League before. I hope we are prepared for that.“We are trying to reach the same level as last year, we want to be consistent, play our football, use or skills and our confidence. We will judge improvement at the end of the season. For now, we just have to do our best.”Left-winger Lorenzo Insigne returned from injury to come off the bench in Napoli’s 2-0 win over Sampdoria at the weekend. Arkadiusz Milik had been expected to be available for selection following a stomach injury, but this match seems to have come a day or two too soon for the striker. Albanian right-back Elseid Hysaj has been ruled out, while one of Hirving Lozano or Fernando Llorente are likely to start up front alongside Dries Mertens. Llorente sat alongside Carlo Ancelotti at last night’s press conference, in a state of affairs that suggests he might get the nod. Andy Robertson didn’t train yesterday for precautionary reasons, but Jurgen Klopp said it “is not a major thing” and the Scotsman seems likely to be passed fit. Divock Origi has been ruled out with the ankle injury he suffered against Newcastle on Saturday and did not travel to Italy. Alisson remains unavailable for selection following the calf injury he picked up during Liverpool’s first game of the season, against Norwich City.Napoli’s San Paolo Stadium is the venue for the beginning of Liverpool’s Champions League title defence, following their victory over Tottenham Hotspur in last season’s final in Atlético Madrid’s Wanda politano Stadium a little under four months ago.Liverpool last won consecutive European Cups in the mid-seventies, beginning a period of English dominance in the competition. Nottingham Forest emulated their feat in 1978-79 and 79-80, before Liverpool won their third final at the end of the 1980-81 campaign, before Aston Villa got in on the act in 1981-82.While both sides playing tonight should pass into the knockout stages with a minimum of fuss, retaining their title this season will be an extremely tall order for Liverpool. Since the European Cup morphed into the bloated, money-spinning behemoth that is the Champions League 27 years ago, only Real Madrid – with their trio of back-to-back-to-back titles earlier this decade – have managed to win more than one in a row. Kick-off tonight is at 8pm (BST), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5269d4e6090db0716f481ccd92a12462ccb283a7/532_14_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=440c242904ddf34f41bb6bc4f55cdc6b","title":"government declines to rule out fresh prorogation if it loses case","story":"Supreme court told PM will ‘abide’ by any ruling but minister declines to say if MPs could be sent away again immediatelyBoris Johnson has given an undertaking to the supreme court that he will “abide” by any ruling it makes about recalling parliament but a government minister declined to be drawn about whether MPs could be sent away again immediately.Addressing an emergency hearing of the UK’s highest court, Lord Keen QC, who is a justice minister and one of the two lawyers representing the prime minister, resisted judicial requests for further pledges guaranteeing parliament’s return.The sometimes testy exchanges between the government’s lawyer and a series of senior supreme court justices came on a day when the political row over Brexit focused on the minutiae of courtroom arguments about Johnson’s advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament for five weeks.The hearing opened on Tuesday with anti-Brexit protesters massing outside the supreme court, directly opposite parliament in Westminster, bearing signs declaring: “Don’t silence our MP”, “Reopen parliament” and “They misled the Queen”.Eleven supreme court justices are sitting for three days to consider appeals from the high court in London and the appeal court in Edinburgh, which reached diametrically opposed views on the lawfulness of Johnson’s actions. The English court ruled it did not have legal authority to examine the prime minister’s decision the Scottish judges declared he had acted illegally to stifle debate in the Commons.Before arguments formally opened, Lady Hale, the supreme court president, acknowledged that it had “serious and difficult questions” before it. That was evidenced, she said, “by the fact that three senior judges in Scotland have reached a different conclusion to three senior judges in England and Wales”.She continued: “The supreme court exists to decide such difficult questions of law and we shall do so in accordance with our judicial oath ...” which declares that the judges will reach their conclusion “without fear or favour, affection or ill will”.Keen, who is also the advocate general for Scotland, also told the supreme court that parliament could have resisted Boris Johnson’s advice to the Queen to prorogue the session and voted to resist the order to close it down for five weeks.His surprising assertion assumed that because parliament had chosen not to act, the courts should not be able to overrule what parliament itself had chosen not to do. If parliament could pass an act preventing a no-deal exit from the EU, Keen said, it could also have legislated, adopting mechanisms within the Northern Ireland Executive Formation Act 2019, to prevent itself being prorogued.Legal argument reached back as far as the often-cited 1610 Case of Proclamations, which imposed limits on the royal prerogative, and referred to William IV as the last monarch who in the 1830s exercised the royal right to prorogue parliament in person.There were robust exchanges over the political precedent set by the postwar Labour government’s decision to prorogue parliament twice in 1948. “It was a naked political use of the prerogative to force through its intended legislation notwithstanding it had no consent in the House of Lords,” Keen told the supreme court.Earlier Lord Pannick QC, who represents the businesswoman and legal campaigner Gina Miller, alleged that Johnson’s motive for introducing a Commons prorogation of five weeks was “to silence parliament for that period”.The prime minister’s extended suspension of MPs’ debate was carried out for an “improper purpose”, he added, to “avoid the risk of parliament undermining the policies of his executive”.“The prime minister’s advice to Her Majesty to prorogue parliament for a period of five weeks is an unlawful abuse of power,” Pannick told the court.A Northern Ireland prorogation claim, argued on behalf of Raymond McCord, a victims’ rights campaigner whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries, will be heard on Thursday. Permission has also been given for five other interveners. They are: the lord advocate for the Scottish government, the counsel general for Wales, Sir John Major, Lady Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, and the Public Law Project.The hearing, which is due to last three days, continues. The court, which is sitting for the first time ever outside its normal legal terms, is not expected to deliver to deliver its judgment before the end of Thursday at the earliest.

And there is little evidence that this billion-dollar industry is cleaning up its act. In February, crystals colonised Tucson. They spread out over carparks and gravel lots, motel courtyards and freeway footpaths, past strip malls and burger bars. Beneath tents and canopies, on block after block, rested every kind of stone imaginable: the opaque, soapy pastels of angeline dark, mossy-toned epidote tourmaline streaked with red and green. There were enormous, dining-table-sized pieces selling for tens of thousands of dollars, lumps of rose quartz for $100, crystal eggs for $1.50. Crystals were stacked upon crystals, filling plastic trays, carved into every possible shape: knives, penises, bathtubs, angels, birds of paradise.It was the month of the Tucson gem shows, a series of markets and exhibitions that collectively make up the largest crystal expo in the world. More than 4,000 crystal, mineral and gemstone vendors had come to sell their wares. They were expecting more than 50,000 customers to pass through, from new age enthusiasts with thick dreadlocks and tie-dye T-shirts, to gallery owners, suited businessmen and major wholesalers. Deals done here would determine the fate of tens of thousands of tonnes of crystals, dispatching them across the US and Europe into museums and galleries, crystal healing and yoga centres, wellness retailers and Etsy stores.Five years ago, crystals were not a big deal. Now, powered by the lucrative combination of social media-friendly aesthetics, cosmic spirituality and the apparently unstoppable wellness juggernaut, they have gone from a niche oddity associated with patchouli and crushed velvet to a global consumer phenomenon. On Instagram, hashtags for #crystals and #healingcrystals tick into the tens of millions. In 2017, the New York Times heralded “the great crystal boom” and in 2018 Hello! described them as the year’s biggest health and wellness trend. Sold as lamps, sex toys, facial massagers or “vaginal eggs” hawked by Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle empire Goop, there is now a crystal for every possible occasion. As Kim Kardashian was recovering from her robbery at gunpoint in 2016, she embraced healing crystals. The model Miranda Kerr has said that she filters all her skincare products through rose quartz “to give the vibration of self-love”.In the US, demand for overseas crystals and gemstones has doubled over the past three years, and quartz imports have doubled since 2014. (Those numbers capture raw stone, but not the crystals imported under many other categories: jewellery, home goods, decorations.) Daniel Trinchillo, owner of Fine Minerals International, a high-end crystal dealership, told me that his business makes between $30m and $40m in sales each year. Trinchillo caters to a growing cohort of celebrities, collectors and investment buyers who want rare and valuable crystals. The most expensive single piece he has sold went for $6m, but he knows of some that have sold for $10m. Trinchillo estimates that high-end dealers now account for about $500m in annual sales. Include the lower end, he said, and you are talking about a highly profitable, multi-billion dollar industry.Despite that explosive growth, the way the crystal industry operates has largely avoided close scrutiny. There is little in the way of fair-trade certification for crystals, and none of the industry-wide transparency schemes developed for commodities such as gold and diamonds. Tracing a crystal from the time it is dragged, dusty and cracked, from the earth, to the polished moment of final sale requires a journey backward down the supply chain: from shop, to exporter, to middleman, to mine, and finally to the men and women who work below the ground, on whose labour a billion-dollar industry has been built.If you want to know where the rose quartz on your shelves comes from, Anjoma Ramartina is a good place to begin. A collection of villages that sits atop some of Madagascar’s largest rose quartz deposits, it is a day’s drive from the capital city of Antananarivo. The further you travel from the capital, the greater the security risks. Large swathes of territory are described as “red zones”, considered unpoliceable by state forces. Rural villages often face raids from armed gangs known as dahalo, who steal cattle, sometimes killing, robbing or raping villagers. In January, the week we arrived in Anjoma Ramartina, three men armed with machetes were killed in a clash with village police. Do not travel or go out at night, people warned. Drive in convoy. Stay off the roads after 5pm.In a cool, dark room in the town council hall, Many Jean Rahandrinimaro, the deputy mayor of Anjoma Ramartina, sunk into a black vinyl couch. “Crystal, amethyst, rose quartz,” he said. “Everything except sapphires and rubies, we mine here.” He placed a few stones on the wooden table in front of him: polished clear quartz and purple amethyst. He estimated that from a population of about 10,000 people, up to a quarter of locals now depended on the mines for some income. Between two and four men died each year in the crystal pits surrounding this village, he said – only two last year, but often it was three or four. “Sometimes it’s very dangerous but they still mine, because they want money,” he said. “There’s the possibility of landslide, that happens a lot here. The soil falls on them and they die.”Landslides are not the only danger for miners. Smashed rocks create fine dust and quartz particles can penetrate deep into the lungs. There, they fester, inflaming surrounding cells, increasing the risk of lung cancer and silicosis. Child labour is also widespread: the US Department of Labor and the International Labour Organization estimate that about 85,000 children work in Madagascar’s mines.A few days after our first meeting, I returned to the town hall. In a ruled exercise book, Many Jean traced a finger over the town’s registry of deaths, tapping entries on the page: here and here, the two men who died in the mines last year, recorded in neat cursive handwriting. And here, Benoit Razafimahatratra, who had died two years earlier when he was looking for quartz at a quarry to the east. Many Jean knew where Benoit’s family lived, and offered to show the way on his motorbike.Bomber jacket flapping behind him, Many Jean took us to the next village. Sitting in a small shop that sold fritters and dried fish was Jean Gregoire Randrianarisoa. He looked tired. Yes, his older brother had died, he said. “What killed him was digging for stones, about 15 metres deep. He went into a tunnel and it collapsed from above and he was buried – someone called for help: ‘Help! Zafimahatratra is buried down there!’ That’s when I went with his children to dig him up,” he said.Benoit was about 55 when he died, said his widow, Josephine Rasondrina, a tiny woman, less than 5 feet tall, with hair neatly ided into braids. She brought out a photograph of him. His features had faded. Josephine gestured at her two granddaughters, about six or seven years old, sitting on the steps. “Since my husband died, they stopped going to school. Since my husband died I got really tired.” She raised her fingers to her temple. “I am really tired. Emotionally and physically – because I have to work the field to feed my children.”Common crystals, such as quartz, can form almost anywhere around the world, when water and steam carry mineral particles into fractures in the earth. Drawn together by the mutual attraction of their electrical charges, their molecules stack in orderly sequences, forming defined planes and repeating facets that can create the pleasing shapes – geodes, prisms – that they’re sought for. In the mineral-rich earth of central Madagascar, villagers often find quartz and citrine deposits by chance, when they are revealed by landslide or washed down to nearby riverbeds. The mines dug to meet growing demand are often improvised, operated off the books and without permits.One of these makeshift mines lies about an 18-mile hike from Anjoma Ramartina’s nearest road. Rakotondrasolo, the man who villagers called the mine owner, found the site about 20 years ago, and continues to work there, along with his family, to this day. One morning, he agreed to show me the mine. Rakotondrasolo is tall and very thin. His worn flannel shirt was buttoned over a T-shirt with the face of Andry Rajoelina, Madagascar’s newly elected president. (The T-shirts were everywhere, after being thrown from trucks and doled out at political rallies across the country during the 2018 election campaign.) The red dust of the landscape had worked its way into the weave of his clothing until every garment was infused with terracotta orange.As we made our way along the red dirt track to the mine, the sun was directly above, shimmeringly hot. Here and there was a sparkle among the scrubby grass: hunks of pink crystal, scattered at the path’s edge. Walking behind Rakotondrasolo, his wife pointed: “The stones are beautiful,” she said quietly, “but the work is very hard.” Then the grass of the track ended sharply and the deep red cavern of the mine fell away in front of us. “Keep away from the edge,” said Rakotondrasolo, gesturing to where the ground was cracked and unstable. The pit dropped 15 metres deep, narrowing as it deepened. On the sheer face of rock were cross-hatched marks of spades and pickaxes. At the far side of the cavern, a huge pile of rose-coloured stones caught the sunlight. At the bottom, a passage disappeared, curving out of the light.“Be careful,” he said, as we trod over the edge of the crater, “the rocks are sharp.” Rose quartz cracked underfoot: jagged, gleaming, a little translucent, shining like the flesh of a fresh-filleted tuna. Later, he lifted a worn trouser leg to show the scars he had acquired from a lifetime of mining: on the right leg, where falling stones crushed his shin, and on the left where a sharp edge split the skin, requiring six stitches.At other times, this crater would have been busy with the sound of men at work – his sons and nephews, who would come to dig and then split the cost of stone they sold – but today it was silent except for Rakotondrasolo’s careful footsteps. They had stopped work: rains had been heavy, and they worried that the water made the cavern less stable. “I was afraid, and was afraid for my children because of this soil. It can collapse on them. I asked them to stop working here,” Rakotondrasolo said.He threw in a handful of gravel and it tumbled to the bottom. Of his 10 children, seven worked with him in the mine. The boys started at the age of about 14. When they find a thick seam of quartz they smash it out of the rock, then chain the pieces together. Some blocks are small, but others are 100kg or even 200kg. The miners drag the boulders out of the hole, sometimes five people hauling together, up on to the grass embankment and toward the hill where lorries come to load them.I asked where the crystals went from there. “To the ports,” Rakotondrasolo shrugged. He did not know. Somewhere overseas. A long time ago a client brought him a rose orb, cut and polished into a sphere, to show him what eventually became of some of the stones he had mined. But the buyers mostly say little about what the crystals are used for or where they end up. They pay him and leave – about 800 ariary, or 23¢ a kilo, he said – 17¢ for lower quality. It is not much when the money is split between the men at work: 800 ariary buys a cup of rice at the village market.As Rakotondrasolo stepped away from the crater, a low hiss sounded behind him. We turned back to see a thin layer of red gravel, loosened from the wall, slide down into the hole.While some mines are large, open pits, others are claustrophobically small: networks of tunnels piercing the earth. About 120 miles east of Anjoma Ramartina lies Ibity, a small village surrounded by tourmaline mines, where you have to dig deep to find stones.“The deeper you go, the more difficult it is to breathe,” said Italy Miliama, a shopkeeper at the centre of the village, scooping coffee into enamel cups.“Once you see a stone, you follow it to find the other stones,” said one of his friends. “We dig, dig, dig. We call it the stone way, the way of stones.”The mines at Ibity spread out like an ochre moonscape. On the morning I visited, about 20 people were above ground sifting through the soil. Among them, a local miner named Jean Baptiste Rakotondravelo and his son stood barefoot, turning a large, improvised pulley. Their backs strained against the weight. A moment later, up came a large yellow jerrycan, full of red earth from below. Jean Baptiste’s son carried it to his mother and young siblings and dumped it on a pile of dirt that they sifted with their fingers. The day was hot, the sun nearing its peak. “It’s extremely hard work,” Jean Baptiste said. “It can’t be done by a few people. It has to be done by many.”At his feet was a hole about a metre in diameter, with sheer sides like a well. Shining my torch down the hole, I couldn’t see to the bottom. Every so often a faint shout echoed up from the darkness, and Jean Baptiste and his son put their backs again to pulling up the bucket. His other sons were working down there, Jean Baptiste told me, digging for tourmaline. He shrugged: “Go down if you like.”Near the top of the hole, it was possible to make out mosquitoes catching the light. As they turned the pulley and I descended, gripping the rope with both hands, the light retreated. The passage down was tight, the damp earth walls grazing my back, elbows and knees. Reaching the bottom, the air felt thin and it was a little harder to draw a full breath. On one side, there was a small horizontal tunnel with room only to crawl.I crouched and shouted into the darkness. “Salama!” two young voices called back, and deep in the tunnel, pair of dim headlamps turned to face me. Two boys blinked into the torchlight. The smallest wore a yellow cloth baseball cap, and his eyes were wide, mouth slightly open with surprise. Their names were Roland and Tavita: Jean Baptiste’s sons, who he says are about 14 and 17. They started working down here two years ago, spending hours digging underground, crouching in the dark, backs curved, calves aching.Deep underground, we looked mutely at each other for a moment. Ducking into the crawl-space, I was conscious of the weight of dirt resting above us: about 19 tonnes of soil and rock, suspended only by its own natural cohesion. Roland and Tavita squatted, jamming a spade or crowbar into the soil to dislodge it and pack it into the jerrycan. When it was full they would crawl back toward the light, shoving the heavy dirt bucket ahead of them, to be dragged up top.“When it’s too long they can have difficulty breathing, so they come out,” Jean Baptiste said, back at the top of the well. Above ground, the boys’ mother, Odette, sat working alongside two generations of children, the youngest a fat-cheeked six-month-old girl. Odette sifted through the dirt, searching for a rock shaped differently from the rest: the small, wine-red and green crystal, tourmaline. “Sometimes we go months without finding any,” she said. They had found just one today, about the size of a knuckle.Odette held it out to me, streaked with red dust, in the middle of her palm. At that moment, it was worth just a few cents. But in the months to come, it would slide along the global supply chain, its value multiplying with each stage of the journey.For the crystals mined in Anjoma Ramartina, the path out of the country is through a company called Madagascar Specimens, which exports about 65 tonnes of carved crystals a year. At its premises, a converted house in the outer suburbs of Antananarivo, boxes of crystals were stacked against the wall. A row of shining SUVs were parked outside the house. Samples stood on the disused fireplace: carved angels, pyramids, geodes, wands. The rose quartz had been trucked in rough from Anjoma Ramartina by a local middleman, the village’s former mayor, who bought large quantities from Rakotondrasolo’s mine.The owner of Madagascar Specimens, Liva Marc Rahdriaharisoa, a tall man in dark jeans, wire-rimmed glasses and a navy T-shirt, gestured to the stack of boxes to his left, packed for shipping. “This, for example, is going to Canada. This to Netherlands. This to the United States,” he said.He lifted the lid on a box of quartz massage wands. “These are very popular.” Then another box of rose quartz hearts: “Some of our best sellers,” he said. “Crystals are the most popular stones now – many customers are looking for it, because – I’m not sure of the English – the medicine with crystals is very popular now. Like therapy, the belief crystals have healing power, you know? It’s very – how do you say? – trendy.”The gem and mineral expo in Tucson was a key point in Liva Marc’s year. “That is where you’re looking for customers,” he said. “You see all customers from around the world: Chinese, Japanese, New Zealand, Australian. It is the biggest market in the world. We go there to exhibit, to sell, but most important is to find customers there.”Between the buyers in the US and the mines in Madagascar was a gulf of experience, which, sitting in the courtyard of Liva Marc’s small factory, he found hard to express. “It’s like two galaxies,” he said, grinning and shaking his head. “It’s a big difference. If I say to people at the mine what Tuscon is like, they will never understand. And if I say to the Tucson people to come here, they will never understand. It’s very different worlds.”Madagascar Specimens exports some crystals rough, but its workshop in Antananarivo also works the stones, cutting them into shapes, grinding and polishing the faces. From Liva Marc’s perspective, refining the stone in Madagascar means creating steady jobs and keeping more of the value of the crystals in the country. With stone that was exported rough and then carved in China or the US, almost none of the profit stayed in Madagascar.The plunder of Madagascar’s resources for profit is nothing new. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the country was a source of slaves, bought by Europeans and sent to work in brutal conditions, often on sugar plantations on the islands of Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues. When the French colonised Madagascar in 1895, they outlawed slavery, but ushered in a new era of forced labour and extraction, with tens of thousands of tonnes of rosewood and millions of francs’ worth of gold shipped offshore each year. More than a century later, the country’s riches still rarely benefit the Malagasy people, says Zo Andriamaro, a sociologist and human rights analyst. Gold, cobalt, sapphires, crystals: she sees them all as part of the same old story, resources siphoned out of the country for the benefit of foreign companies. “There has to be some more systematic way of controlling and regulating the market for all types of minerals coming from here,” she says. “It is totally unjust.”Mining also threatens Madagascar’s rainforest. When new mining sites are discovered, sometimes thousands of men migrate to mine, encroaching on protected environmental areas and threatening the survival of endangered species. Embracing mining on a larger scale is “intrinsically, fundamentally unsustainable and destructive”, Andriamaro says. “You can never pretend that you will restore the environment to its initial state.”The month after we spoke in Madagascar, Liva Marc and a shipping container full of his stones landed in Arizona, bound for the Tucson shows. I met him in a hotel lobby, one of three retail spots he had in the city. Business was good, he said. Buyers from all over the world had come.The stalls around him showcased towering display pieces: rose quartz boulders, massive amethyst geodes. They had been cleaned, polished and set on display, but he still looked at them and thought of their origins. “All these big pieces – imagine how they must dig it. How difficult it must be,” he said. “Imagine how it starts.”While the crystal business is booming, and largely among consumers who tend to be concerned with environmental impact, fair trade and good intentions, there is little sign of the kind of regulation that might improve conditions for those who mine them.Julia Schoen, co-founder of the crystal drink bottle company Glacce (tagline “Luxury Spiritual”) told me that ethical sourcing is “the No 1 priority” for her company. Schoen was speaking on the phone from her office in New Orleans, where she told me she was surrounded by crystals that had been unboxed and laid out, waiting to be blessed by staff, who would burn sage smudge sticks and pray to cleanse them before use.Glacce sells water bottles and metal straws embedded with rose quartz, amethyst and other crystals, which are supposed to transform ordinary water into a “crystal elixir”, where the water takes on the healing properties of the crystal. The bottles were touted by Vanity Fair as “2018’s Status Symbol” and are sold by bohemian-themed fashion retailer Free People, as well as Goop. Schoen said sales of the bottles, which retail for $60-$100, had increased exponentially since they started the business, and demand often outstripped supply.But even with a booming market, she said, the company didn’t yet have a budget to track their crystals to their source at the mines. Instead, Glacce depended on Chinese middlemen to select crystals, including those from Madagascar. Schoen told me that Glacce’s suppliers “know that we do not want to be having our money go towards a mine that’s using child labour. They know all these things.” At present, she said, they considered transparency a high priority and hoped to develop relationships with inidual mines by 2020, but could offer no concrete reassurances about the current conditions of their miners.“In an industry that has not been so regulated and maybe hasn’t had so many eyeballs on it, there are obviously practices that most people who are purchasing crystals would not want to know about,” Schoen acknowledged. “You know, at the end of the day it’s like, our intentions are – ” she paused. “I think we’re clear what our intentions are.”The challenge of sourcing crystals ethically is one faced by the industry as a whole: Glacce, Goop or any given Etsy vendor are no more culpable than the next crystal dealer. Every retailer I spoke to raised the question of price. Would crystal consumers really be willing to pay more to guarantee safer, child labour-free mines, or a fair wage for miners? Schoen compared it to the organic food movement: if enough people wanted assurance of their products’ provenance, the supply systems would develop.Bajoras visited Madagascar often, but rarely made it out to the mines, opting instead to deal with middlemen in the cities. But he knew the villages of Anjoma Ramartina and Ibity: “Yeah. All our rose quartz comes from that area. All the tourmaline comes from there,” he said.And if some of the conditions are truly awful? “Awful is relative, remember,” he shot back. The volume of his voice rose slightly, but he was still smiling. “Your job looks horrible to me. I feel for you. I’m glad that you’re willing to do it, because we need people like you to do it, but I ain’t fuckin’ doing it, no way. I would rather die in a mine, any day, no doubt. Holy shit. No. Not happening. Spell check? You’re out of your fucking mind.”Meanwhile, the $4.2tn wellness industry rolls on, bolstered by profits from cheap crystals and a generation looking for alternative modes of healing. Bajoras was confident his stones had healing power. After all, he said, if uranium could kill you, why shouldn’t lithium quartz be able to help cure your depression? And when you broke it down to an elemental level, he said, people are mostly minerals and water anyway. “You’re hydrated mineral powder,” he told me. “You are! You’re like Kool-Aid.”Beneath a tented canopy beside the Tucson freeway, his colleague Alexa Stamison was selling an array of Madagascan rose quartz, carnelian and amethyst. Stamison had a warm, open manner and an encyclopedic knowledge of their stones.A woman dressed all in white – crocheted shirt, maxi skirt and headscarf draped over her top-knot – approached the stall. “How much is this carnelian?” she asked. The stone was $30. A stone of empowerment, Stamison told me, great for women going out on their own or moving into a new home.“I think I need it, it was just calling to me and I couldn’t walk away,” the woman said. “I don’t need a bag, I’ll just carry it.” She walked away, cradling the stone.If anything, Stamison wonders if the circumstances of miners in Madagascar, “makes the pieces a lot more special. Because I know some person in a little baby hut was actually polishing it by hand, and they’re setting their intentions into it, too,” she said. “People’s intentions and people’s energy are put into the stones as they’re producing it.”“So the circumstances they’re mined in, they are embedded into the stone somehow?” I asked.“I think so. A little bit, it has to be. It has to be.”Additional research by Holifeno Hantanrinoro and Teddy Rahenintsoa• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69fb1c208e6c778249f0ffe8b7c24dc0f901a9ec/0_0_3500_2091/master/3500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f97792f783d4e154613165077242d70a 720w","title":"brexit weekly briefing plot twists galore but no progress","story":"PM said ‘huge progress’ was being made but the EU said there were no grounds for re-opening talksWelcome to the ’s weekly Brexit briefing. If you’d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our latest Brexit Means … podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.Plot twists galore, but – not for the first time – nothing you might describe as actual progress. A Scottish appeal court ruled that Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful – but did not order MPs to return.The government was forced to release its secret Operation Yellowhammer “planning assumptions” for a no-deal Brexit, which warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder on Britain’s streets.Johnson continued to insist “huge progress” was being made – although No 10 played down hopes of a breakthrough involving an all-Ireland regulatory regime for food and agriculture which it thinks could help replace the backstop, and Michel Barnier said there were “no grounds” for formally re-opening talks.Increasingly alarmed at the possibility that the PM might try to break the law by forcing a no deal, however, a cross-party group of MPs looked at bringing back a version of Theresa May’s deal, plus a vote on a second referendum, in late October.And the outgoing Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, warned that he was prepared to rip up the parliamentary rulebook to stop any illegal attempt by the prime minister to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October.Johnson did, at least, meet the outgoing president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. It did not go well. Before heading to Luxembourg, the PM compared himself to the Incredible Hulk, throwing off the shackles of the EU.Despite EU officials repeatedly insisting they had seen no concrete British proposals whatsoever on alternatives to the backstop, the foreign secretary, Domic Raab, said the bloc had heard enough and was indulging in “political posturing”.Johnson told Juncker the UK would not ask for a further Brexit extension and would not accept one if the EU offered it – nor would it request any extension to the EU transition period beyond December 2020 if he got a Brexit deal.Unfortunately, the PM was then humiliated by his Luxembourg counterpart, Xavier Bettel, who went ahead with a planned joint press conference that Johnson dodged because of protesters – and savaged Johnson’s Brexit approach.All eyes, meanwhile, are on 11 supreme court judges who this week will hear the politically charged claim that the PM acted unlawfully in advising the Queen to suspend parliament for five weeks in order to stifle debate over the Brexit crisis.Some people worry that if the government wins, Johnson may even decide to suspend parliament for a second time when it returns on 14 October.Who knows? But four main scenarios seem to present themselves:Unlikely as it may seem, Johnson could still get a deal, probably based around a border in the Irish sea. He would find getting it through parliament very hard, but perhaps not impossible, helped maybe by Labour MPs in leave-voting constituencies.He could decide to break his promise, request an extension and then immediately demand an election, counting on a fiercely anti-EU, people-versus-parliament campaign to see him through.He could, theoretically at least, go for no deal on 31 October, testing or even ignoring the law. Early elections would follow, with the PM trusting that with Brexit delivered, the Brexit party would be no more – and that no deal would not be too catastrophic.Or he could resign or be pushed out. Rather than the isive Jeremy Corbyn, a more neutral figure (Ken Clarke?) might then head up a temporary government whose sole purpose would be to ask the EU for an extension, with elections to follow.In the , Matthew d’Ancona says Boris Johnson’s invocation of the Incredible Hulk was apt – his behaviour is monstrous:During the leadership contest, Johnson said that the chances of no deal were a “million to one against”. Last month he said it was “touch and go”. Now, in advance of his meeting Jean-Claude Juncker, he claims that “we will get there”. Which Johnson to believe?Frankly, all this briefing about “breakthroughs” and diplomatic “movement” strikes me as mere preparatory work for the attribution of blame as 31 October approaches. Imagine Johnson and his acolytes raging as the deadline gets near, and how they will complain that the prime minister’s superhuman efforts have been undermined – by Brussels, by remainiacs, by disloyal Tories, by judges, by Larry the cat.It will all be someone else’s fault. That, at least, is what they will say. But don’t believe a word of it. Inside the Hulk, there is and has always been a small and fearful man, wondering, with good reason, what will become of him when he loses all his strength.A thread from a professor of EU law that is a wonder of clarity and concision:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be63f2dde43c1148396652730597ff0c4141b1ed/492_120_3742_2246/master/3742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e2bcc6811bd0a5189d02aff67e1879a","title":"corbyn vows to put sensible brexit deal to voters in referendum","story":"Labour leader says as PM he would ‘carry out whatever the people decide’ in second EU referendum with remain as an optionJeremy Corbyn has set out the four pillars of a “sensible” Brexit deal he would negotiate with the EU, as he pledged to carry out whatever the people decide in a second EU referendum as Labour prime minister.The Labour leader set out how he would go into an election offering to negotiate a Brexit deal involving a customs union, ahead of next week’s autumn conference where activists will launch a bid to shift the party’s position towards campaigning to remain in the EU.At the annual gathering in Brighton, some members will attempt to force a conference vote on the issue, with the aim of getting a promise to campaign for remain in the party’s next general election manifesto. Senior shadow cabinet figures - John McDonnell, Emily Thornberry, Tom Watson and Nick Brown –have all said they would want to campaign to stay in the bloc regardless of any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour.However, Corbyn’s statement is the strongest sign yet that he will resist demands to pick a side and would opt to stay out of campaigning in a second referendum on a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal, allowing him to pitch himself as the neutral referee who pledges to carry out whatever the public decides.This would help avoid the situation David Cameron found himself in as prime minister in 2016, when he resigned from No 10 after ending up on the losing side.In the article, Corbyn laid down a marker of his determination to seek a better Brexit deal from the EU, which the party believes it could negotiate quickly based on conversations already undertaken with Brussels.“A Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU a close single market relationship and guarantees of workers’ rights and environmental protections,” he said. “We would then put that to a public vote alongside remain, and I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.”This would form the basis of what Corbyn describes as a “credible leave option” which would be offered at a referendum against the option of remaining in the EU.“We would then put that to a public vote against remain, and I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister,” he said.Corbyn also positioned Labour as “the only UK-wide party ready to put our trust in the people of Britain to make the decision”, after the Liberal Democrats changed their position to campaigning for a revocation of article 50 in a bid to attract remain voters.He said: “Johnson wants to crash out with no deal. That is something opposed by business, industry, the trade unions and most of the public – and even by the Vote Leave campaign’s co-convener, Michael Gove, who said earlier this year: ‘We didn’t vote to leave without a deal.’“And now the Liberal Democrats want MPs to overturn the referendum result by revoking article 50 in a parliamentary stitch-up. It is simply undemocratic to override the decision of a majority of the voters without going back to the people.“Labour is the only party determined to bring people together. Only a vote for Labour will deliver a public vote on Brexit. Only a Labour government will put the power back into the hands of the people. Let’s stop a no-deal Brexit – and let the people decide.”Corbyn’s decision to set out his stall in favour of negotiating a Brexit deal and then putting that to a referendum presents a challenge to conference delegates over whether to back his stance or a more pro-remain position if it comes to a vote.An effort to change Labour’s Brexit position will start on Saturday in Brighton, where delegates will discuss 80 motions submitted by local parties in favour of campaigning to remain in a second referendum.After a process called “compositing”, one or two motions will emerge to be voted on by the wider conference later in the week. This may end up as a battle between largely remain-supporting activists and trade unions who favour Corbyn’s position, unless the two sides can agree on a compromise motion that avoids a public row.A majority of the Brexit motions submitted have been put forward either by Another Europe is Possible (AEP) or two other groups, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour.Last week, Watson, the party’s deputy leader, used a speech to argue that Labour should “unambiguously and unequivocally back remain”, and also seek a second Brexit referendum before a general election. The idea was swiftly rejected by Corbyn, who called it “Tom’s view”.In his article, Corbyn promised that he would back a general election as soon as Boris Johnson’s threat of a no deal Brexit is avoided through an extension to article 50.“As soon as no deal is off the table, and the prime minister has complied with the law, we need a general election to get rid of Johnson’s Tory government,” he said. “That election will be about much more than Brexit. It will be a choice between a Labour government that will put wealth and power in the hands of the many, and Johnson’s born-to-rule Conservatives who will look after the privileged few. It will be about who will truly end austerity and deliver the change Britain needs, invest in every region and nation of our country, and rebuild our public services, communities and industry.“The people of Britain deserve to have their say in a general election. Only a Labour government would end the Brexit crisis by taking the decision back to the people. We will give the people the final say on Brexit, with the choice of a credible leave offer and remain.”The issue of Brexit is likely to dominate Labour’s conference in Brighton but there will also be debate over the campaign pushing for the party to adopt a “Green New Deal”, involving a zero carbon target by 2030 and more green jobs.Separately, the party’s national executive committee met on Tuesday to agree rule changes to speed up expulsions from Labour in serious cases of wrongdoing, which will be put to a vote at conference. It also agreed to consider ways to speed up selections for parliamentary candidates in key seats. Some MPs believe this will lead to candidates being parachuted in from the centre rather than letting local parties decide in all circumstances – although proposals have not yet been worked up by party officials.There was also a row ahead of the NEC meeting over proposals by Jon Lansman, an ally of Corbyn and founder of Momentum, to replace Labour Students with another student body. Labour Students hit back against the move, saying it is legitimately affliated and had paid its fees, with MPs suggesting it was being targeted because it is not sufficiently supportive of Corbyn. Wes Streeting, a Labour MP, said: “The Labour party should be focusing all its energies on winning the next general election, not Jon Lansman’s factional vendettas against Labour Students. It is literally student politicking, when we’re in the fight our lives for the future of the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0da2e07bb13239463de9393dcb38ae2e788d572f/0_119_3560_2136/master/3560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0368ce36039a01fda4125ea5b2bfeb2f","title":"eu given brexit draft with backstop scrubbed out uk sources admit","story":"PM’s negotiators intent on waiting until last minute before sharing plan with BrusselsBoris Johnson’s Brexit negotiators have so far only presented the EU with a draft of the withdrawal agreement with the backstop scrubbed out, UK government sources have confirmed.In a move that has caused tensions with EU leaders, Johnson’s team are refusing to put forward a written proposal to Brussels at this stage for fear it will be rejected out of hand or publicly rubbished.Instead, they want to wait until almost the last minute before the October summit before presenting a plan to the EU, with just two weeks before the UK is due to leave the bloc.The UK government source said the two sides had debated alternatives to the backstop in written discussion documents – such as an all-Ireland regulatory zone and customs checks away from the border – but they would not be putting forward a legal text to the EU at this stage.There have been reports that David Frost, the UK’s lead negotiator, is keeping a plan locked safe in his briefcase but the wording has not been shared with Brussels.Frustration with the UK’s approach broke into the open on Monday as Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, gave a press conference next to an empty podium following a meeting with Johnson, who refused to take part because of loud protests nearby. Bettel said the UK government needed to put on paper an alternative to the Irish backstop, and appeared to suggest that party political considerations might be standing in the way.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspand the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May\u0027s withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.As the chaotic scenes were played out, the European commission issued a statement disclosing that its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had told the prime minister it was his responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions and that “such proposals have not yet been made”.Johnson has brushed off the Luxembourg incident with a claim that he is still working towards a deal and believes EU leaders will want to strike an agreement because they have had a “bellyful” of Brexit.He spoke to Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on Tuesday morning, agreeing to have further discussions with her in New York at the UN general assembly next week. There are only three days left until the end of the 30-day deadline Merkel gave Johnson last month to come up with alternative solutions to remove the need for a backstop, which Eurosceptics in parliament refuse to vote for because it could keep the UK indefinitely in a customs union.Johnson is also likely to meet Donald Tusk, the European council president, at the UN conference and No 10 hopes that some progress towards a deal could be made at that summit.However, many in Brussels are sceptical there is enough time left to do a deal. It is just one month before the crucial EU summit on 17 October, where Johnson hopes to secure a deal, and six weeks before the UK is due to leave on 31 October unless it requests an extension.Johnson is mandated by the UK parliament to seek a three-month extension if he does not strike a Brexit deal by then. He has insisted he will not do this but has not set out how he would avoid such an outcome.Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, refused on Tuesday to rule out a second prorogation as part of No 10’s tactics to achieve a no-deal Brexit.Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether the current suspension of parliament could happen again, Buckland said: “Harold Wilson said a week is a long time in politics. It seems like an hour is a long time in politics at the moment.“For me to sit here and imagine what might happen at the end of October, I think, is idle. What I do know, if we are able to, we will have a Queen’s speech in mid-October, there will be debate during that time and a vote as well, and perhaps a series of votes.“Parliament has already shown its power. It had a week in September where it made pretty significant legislation. I think the idea that somehow parliament has been prevented from having its voice doesn’t seem to be borne out by events, frankly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30e520a0db10bfb699691c439f9a1a4678d9b5bf/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=872716bd0100e1be85741322bb4a45a2","title":"how far can buoyant liberal democrats bounce back","story":"Activists at conference in Bournemouth speculated they could end up with 200 MPsAt what was a pre-election conference in all but name, any time a group of Liberal Democrat activists gathered the same question would arise: how far can a buoyant party with a bounce in its step, a clear Brexit position and a new leader rise from its current 18 MPs?However there was one point of consensus: amid so many political imponderables, a lot could change in the following few months.Nonetheless, most of the Lib Dem faithful will return home from a sunny few days in Bournemouth energised for an election which could very conceivably end with Jo Swinson cast as the powerbroker in a hung parliament.Quite what Swinson would do with that power was the great unanswered question, as she has categorically ruled out supporting either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn in office, informally or otherwise. Beyond Brexit there is still a feeling among the party faithful that policy is a little thin.The feelgood factor started early, as a pre-conference rally saw ex-Tory Sam Gyimah, unveiled as MP number 18, the sixth defector to cross from the Conservatives or Labour in recent months.By Monday night, a still slightly stunned-looking Gyimah was on stage at “Glee club”, a rowdy and drunken annual fringe event where activists and MPs sing satirical songs packed with Lib Dem in-jokes. Two other new arrivals, Sarah Wollaston and Luciana Berger, were also amid the throng.The one key policy change confirmed at the conference relates to Brexit, the party’s main election battleground. This is the notion that if Swinson’s party won an absolute majority in the Commons, admittedly an unlikely turn of events, she would immediately cancel Brexit, with no referendum.The plan was overwhelmingly supported by delegates as both a means of putting renewed distance between the Lib Dems and a Labour party increasingly warm on the idea of a so-called people’s vote, and of avoiding the paradox of fighting the election theoretically committing Swinson to finding a Brexit deal she would then disown.However, there were some quibbles, more or less the only ones on show at Swinson’s honeymoon conference. Several delegates took to the podium to warn this was, in effect, a narrow, core-vote strategy, tickling the fantasies of urban-based ardent remainers, but doing nothing to expand the party’s reach.Sir Norman Lamb, always something of a Brexit outlier among Lib Dem MPs, added another argument: such an absolutist position risked cementing ision over Brexit. It was, he said, “playing with fire”.But most senior party members seemed keen to endorse Swinson’s idea, or at the very least give her the benefit of the doubt. Sticking to the combustible theme, she warned a no-deal Brexit would be like “burning down the house”.Other election policies beyond the EU included an idea for a so-called wellbeing metric for future budgets, basing decisions on not just likely economic growth but also assessments of how they could affect people’s happiness and sense of purpose.It is not a new idea – it was borrowed from New Zealand, and was also adopted by Labour two months ago – but was warmly received, and is seemingly aimed at giving a slightly more cuddly economic face to a party still associated with its role in the savage austerity cuts of the David Cameron-led coalition.For the new recruits it was a great first conference. Berger and Wollaston spoke at length of the warm and positive reception they had been given from members. Chuka Umunna and Gymiah were spotted sitting next to each other, chatting away, on their train back to London.Whether the honeymoon period of a party effectively reinvigorated and reformulated can last though will be a test for Swinson’s leadership. When an election is called and the squabble for seats unfolds between long-standing activists and newer members, it will take some resolve to steer what could be quite a fragile ship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269f121e65f6d76958428d4eb0d98bf9d4c1e81a/182_375_3802_2281/master/3802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78f0f1791645b691433fbbe947688ff2","title":"ukip leader accused of insulting party over conference no show","story":"Richard Braine has pulled out of the conference in Newport after fewer than 450 tickets were soldThe leader of Ukip has been accused of a “complete insult” after he decided to boycott his own party conference due to low ticket sales.Richard Braine has pulled out of the conference after fewer than 450 tickets were sold for the two-day event. The party was hoping to attract double the amount of delegates to the event in Newport, south Wales, later this month.In the latest furore to engulf the party infamous for its public spats, the Ukip chair, Kirstan Herriot, wrote to all members stating new leader Braine had attempted to cancel the conference due to a potentially low turnout.In the email sent to all members, Herriot, backed by Ukip’s ruling national executive committee (NEC), said Braine’s stance had been a complete affront to “hard-working” party members. She confirmed the conference would go ahead despite Braine’s no-show.She wrote: “Both I and the NEC believe it is a complete insult to the membership to attempt to cancel conference because of a potentially low turn out. It is also a particular affront to hard-working regional, county and branch officers who have worked hard in encouraging members to attend conference to hear Richard lay out his vision for the future of Ukip. It is therefore a particular shame that he has decided not to do this.”In order to increase delegate numbers, the party said it had now decided to offer some free single-day tickets and those who had paid for their one-day ticket would be offered a refund.Herriot’s email added that Braine was still welcome to take his “rightful place” on the conference stage should he have a “change of heart”.Ukip has suffered a slump in the polls following the rise of the Brexit party, which was founded by Nigel Farage after he quit Ukip over the former leader Gerard Batten’s anti-Islam views and links to the far-right activist Tommy Robinson.Having previously been leader from September 2006 to November 2009 Farage regained control of Ukip for their last period of stability. He lead them to win almost\u0026nbsp4m votes in the 2015 general election, making them the third-biggest party by vote share.Things went awry shortly after the MEP succeeded Farage in the wake of the Brexit referendum. In\u0026nbspjust 18 days James was gone, saying splits at the top of the party made it impossible for her to do the job.Farage held the fort as interim leader ahead of a new election.The former deputy leader confidently\u0026nbsppredicted he would help Ukip replace Labour. But this ambition crumbled amid\u0026nbspquestions about his credibility\u0026nbspand a failed\u0026nbsptilt at the Stoke Central by-election. He\u0026nbspstepped down after\u0026nbspUkip slumped to below 600,000 votes in the 2017 election.The little-known former army officer\u0026nbspbeat off six challengers to win, positioning himself as the sensible candidate who would revamp the party structure. But an unexciting start to his tenure turned chaotic after he began a relationship with much younger activist Jo Marney, who turned out\u0026nbspto have sent deeply offensive messages.Took the party further to the right with a focus on Islam and appointing convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson as the party\u0027s \u0027grooming gangs adviser\u0027. A crushing defeat in the 2019 European Elections saw the party lose 24 percentage points as voters deserted for the Brexit party, and effectively ended Batten as leader.Ukip members elected Richard Braine as the new leader. Braine said he wanted to establish Ukip as the “far-moderate voice of common sense” in Britain, but within days was embroiled in controversy after footage emerged of him arguing it should be illegal to publicly distribute the Qur’an in the UK, and that some British towns are no-go areas for non-Muslims.When contacted by the , Braine said he would not be commenting, saying only that it was an internal decision by the chair to contact party members. However, in an email to Ukip members, Braine confirmed his decision, saying he had been informed by the party treasurer that it was facing a “very low turnout” for its conference.Braine said he had proposed moving the conference to a venue in north-east England and called for Batten to be reinstated to the party. He claimed the NEC had been misinformed about the number of attendees, with the real number being much lower.He wrote: “I have made clear to the chairman and NEC that I would not attend unless something drastic was done to increase ticket sales, namely returning Gerard Batten to good standing to heal the rift with the many members who are boycotting conference for that reason, and installing one of the two candidates I have put forward to be chairman.”Braine claims his advice was rejected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960e4106ea65db70231a275e234ba0904b5015d9/0_226_4194_2516/master/4194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138ff4e15ca006682efe1c0d921e96aa","title":"adil rashid cricket test yorkshire central contracts","story":"Adil Rashid is due to sit down with Yorkshire to discuss his future amid thoughts of a return to white-ball specialism in order to prolong his playing career.Rashid, 31, has not featured for club or country since the World Cup final in July because of the chronic right shoulder injury that required painkilling injections to nurse him throughout the victorious campaign.The leg-spinner sees a 12-month all-format contract at Headingley expire at the end of the season, one that sat under the Test deal he was handed by England last summer after being talked out of a break from first-class cricket to feature in the series against India. But with Ashley Giles, the director of England cricket, set to reveal his centrally contracted players for 2019-20 this Friday – and Rashid expected to feature only among the white‑ball cricketers – he faces another crossroads.Rashid’s injury is more serious than some have made out. When he tried to return in the T20 Blast in August, the pain-masking injections from the World Cup had worn off. With an impingement in the joint and ligament damage, two months of rest was prescribed in order to be ready for the winter tours.In contrast to the joyous scenes after the World Cup when, as a key member of Eoin Morgan’s one-day side, he received a hero’s welcome in his home city of Bradford, the reaction to his injury on social media was mixed.There were claims from supporters that Rashid had “no interest” in the club, he was “lazy”, had a “chronic attitude problem” and it was time to “get rid”. The club stating that he “declared himself unfit” before the full diagnosis did not help.“I was upset about that,” Rashid said. “They way it was phrased meant some people could perceive it as me not wanting to play for the club. But that’s not true. I was really looking forward to the T20s.There is history behind the scepticism, stemming back to the County Championship decider against Middlesex at Lord’s in 2016 and a defeat that denied Yorkshire three titles in a row. It is hard not to wonder whether, like recent events, the way this played out publicly was slightly unfair on the leg-spinner.Rashid was one of three England players who was down to rest before an epic tour to Bangladesh and India that departed the following week. Yet unlike Root, centrally contracted, and Jonny Bairstow, about to start one himself, he did not have England to absorb the blame for him.It was also the biggest opportunity of his Test career – seven near‑guaranteed matches on the spin-friendly tracks of the subcontinent – but when the club asked him to reconsider, a family illness was also unfolding in the buildup to his departure overseas and he felt unable to change tack.Rashid explained: “That decision was bigger than cricket – it was life or death. My grandma was on her death bed and I was going away on tour the next week. Looking back, I’m still happy I made that decision. All the decisions I make with Yorkshire and my career, I never regret.“For Yorkshire fans who still don’t accept that, that’s their problem. There are some for me, some against. Sometimes it can be upsetting and I think: ‘Why am I singled out?’ You have doubts in your head about the reasons.“But myself and Yorkshire, we’re on good terms at the moment. You can have a bit of bad engagement or disagreements over time but as long as you get back on the same page, that’s all that matters. I enjoy playing for Yorkshire and see myself representing Yorkshire in future.”Yorkshire have told the  they feel the same. Despite the outside noise, Rashid is highly regarded at the club – one senior club official described him as “low maintenance” – and they hope to sign him up for the Headingley 100‑ball team, too.The only question now is which formats he plays. Were he to sign a new white-ball-only deal, it would rule him out of England’s Test tour to Sri Lanka next March after last year’s call-up forced a change to the selection policy that sees players only eligible for formats they are contracted for domestically."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177266617a0ae7a61e0e28d82fad6c021fc5f8df/246_0_5115_3069/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4717188a9851af42bec1d834b7e18b15","title":"japan embrace rugby world cup shock","story":"There were six people in the bar, five friends and now one stranger too. I would have backed right out but then the barmaid said she wanted to practice her English. She’d been taking lessons, she explained, because she’s so excited about the Tokyo Olympics and is sure she will enjoy it more if she can talk to all the tourists who’ll be coming here next year. By the time I’d finished my drink we had established that no, this wasn’t my first time in Japan, that I have family in Sapporo, and, after I’d made a clumsy mime of typing on the bar, that I was here on business, working as a sports journalist. The one thing we got stuck on was exactly which sport I was here to cover.“Rugby,” I said. “Rugby?” she replied. “Yes, rug-by.” There didn’t seem to be any other syllables left to try and stress, so in the end I pulled out my phone and Googled a photo for her. “Ah, rugby,” she said. Yes, rugby, I replied, trying to copy the way she said it, the World Cup. “Oh yes,” she said, unimpressed. “When does that start?” You’ll hear a lot of spurious official statistics about the millions of Japanese people who have just discovered rugby in the next few weeks, less about the millions more who, like her, remain entirely oblivious to it.You notice them in Tokyo, though. They had 15,000 locals turn up to welcome the Welsh in Kitakyushu, but it feels like the World Cup has got a lot of competition here. The baseball is on, and the autumn sumo too. So it really seems a wildly brave and audacious move for World Rugby to bring their main event, one of the biggest tournaments on earth, to a country where their game is a minority sport.According to a recent white paper there are around 100,000 registered rugby players in Japan, which is around a third as many as badminton has, a quarter as many as volleyball, a tenth as many as football. The average match in the domestic rugby league pulls in a crowd of around 5,000.Big sport doesn’t usually work this way. There has been nothing quite like it since Fifa took the football World Cup to the USA in 1994. World Rugby is hoping the gamble will open up a new market. They need it to. There aren’t many hosts left among the top rugby nations who can guarantee them the kind of reliable financial return that has allowed them to spend £64m in four years developing the game in Japan and the other tier two nations. England is one, France is another, and it is no surprise that one of those hosted the World Cup before this, and the other will host the World Cup after it.Early the next morning the Japanese players who are going to be doing the missionary work were busy rehearsing their lineout drills at the Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium in central Tokyo. The Japanese may love a plucky underdog, back in 2003 a racehorse called Haru Urara (“the shining star of losers everywhere” ) became a national celebrity after it lost 100 races in a row, but rugby’s popularity rides on how well the national team are doing. The average league attendances almost doubled after Japan beat South Africa in 2015. And right now, it feels like there is an awful lot depending on whether or not they can do it again against Ireland or Scotland in the pool stages.The Prince Chichibu ground is the “spiritual home of Japanese rugby”– they have been playing here for 70 years, but won’t be during this tournament. There are plans to knock it down soon after the competition is over so it can be used as a car park for the impressive new Olympic Stadium which is being built just up the road.That was supposed to be ready in time to host the first and last matches of this tournament, but then the government scrapped the original plans and started over, so construction slowed down and now it is due to open a month after the World Cup finishes.Never mind the baseball, then, these games are very much in the shadow of those Games. The Olympics seem to get nine minutes of airtime for every one afforded the rugby, it’s the Olympic logo that is on the side of all the taxi cabs, the Olympic mascots mugging on all the billboards.So rugby has got to make every use of this little six-week window. The game has got to show the best side of itself, be fast, hard-fought, free-flowing. And that is how they are selling it on the fliers and adverts they have put up around the city. My favourite of them is the poster for the spectators’ village which has been set up out in Fuchu to the west of the city, with the slogan “Let’s watch the great power of live battle of men on the big screen!” Even an Ebisu barmaid might be tempted by an invitation like that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c4697fc6d09f920b219f9732f63b2867c4a237c/0_0_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e694a2f43a8759be356b7d5802b8626","title":"the 50 best theatre shows of the 21st century","story":"A hip-hop history lesson, a dizzy Dahl musical and a continent-hopping barbershop … we pick the finest new works of theatre since 2000by  Michael Billington,  Alexis Soloski,  Catherine Love,  Mark Fisher and  Chris WiegandFew productions this century have ided opinion like Three Kingdoms. Simon Stephens’ detective yarn took audiences on a thrilling and disorientating trip across Europe, in a trilingual collaboration with German director Sebastian Nübling and Estonian designer Ene-Liis Semper. Loathed and loved in equal measure, it has undoubtedly galvanised a new generation of directors inspired by continental European theatre. And in its pre-Brexit deconstruction of Britain’s relationship with Europe, it feels chillingly prescient. CL Read the review.Wild, scorching and gleefully profane, Young Jean Lee’s early play is an Asian-American identity-politics comedy. Lee, a Korean-American artist, populated the stage with three women in traditional Korean dress and a fourth woman, Korean-American, who despises them. (There’s also a very boring white couple.) An exquisitely uncomfortable exploration of bias, it also includes mimed suicides choreographed to Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas. Lee continued to explore themes of prejudice and stereotype in works such as The Shipment and Straight White Men, but this finds her at her most scurrilous and original.

Mission Drift’s heady mix of history, mythology and floor-shaking tunes skewered the American dream while recreating the giddy, greedy thrill it promises. In the age of Donald Trump, I’ve yet to see another play that quite so incisively captures the myth of the United States and all the ugliness it has bred. CL Read the review.Kwame Kwei-Armah’s play, which began life at the National before transferring, was one of the first by a black British dramatist to make it to the West End. Even if it eventually flirts with melodrama, Elmina’s Kitchen is a work of surging vitality that takes on board gun control, the battle between books and consumerism, and the maelstrom of life in a Hackney eatery.

Deprived of sight, you focus intensely on each stimulus. Then, vision restored, you see a face in front of you. A tear rolls down his cheek. Devastating. This was the first UK visit of Ontroerend Goed, the remarkable Belgian company skilled in generating heightened emotions by unconventional means. MF Read the review.Who would have thought that a TV interview would be the source of such gripping drama? Peter Morgan skilfully showed how David Frost’s 1977 encounter with Richard Nixon was more than an on-camera combat between a talkshow host and a disgraced president. It implied that the two men, in vastly different ways, needed each other. Frost, having lost his American and Australian programmes, was seeking to restore his dwindling fortunes, while Nixon craved public expiation of his Watergate sins. Morgan also made one nostalgic for a time when current affairs TV had theatrical power.

Its ostensible subject was the way a group of Ashington miners, from 1934 to 1947, were turned into formidably skilful painters. Hall’s play was fundamentally about the relationship between art and socialism and suggested that society had to be measured by its capacity for political change rather than by personal progress. MB Read the review.Initially seen as a slur against Irish patriotism, Martin McDonagh’s black comedy has gained even more resonance with time. Mad Padraic, a gunman deemed too extreme for the IRA, returns to his native village to avenge himself on the killers of his beloved cat. While still hair-raising, the play now seems like a potent satire on terrorist violence. MB Read the review.A tidy two-hander that somehow encompasses much of US history in its brief scenes, Suzan-Lori Parks’ lively and cerebral comedy centres on two brothers, one named Lincoln and the other Booth, locked in love and deadly rivalry. No prizes for guessing how this one ends. Lincoln works at a shooting gallery, dressing up, in whiteface and stovepipe, as the president he is named for. Booth hopes to master three-card monte, a sidewalk con game. TopdogUnderdog enjoy its pretences and con games, but it is Parks’ language – vibrant, poetic, jazz-inflected – that makes this play the real deal. AS Read the review.Goldoni’s 18th century comedy, Il Servitore di Due Padroni, has had many makeovers but few funnier than this one by Richard Bean. The action was shifted from Venice to 1960s Brighton, the hero became a failed skiffle player and the masterstroke was the addition to the dinner-serving scene of an octogenarian waiter with a tremulous hand and a remarkable capacity to rebound after falling backwards down the stairs. MB Read the review.With a score by Jeanine Tesori and book and lyrics by Tony Kushner, this was a genuine musical game-changer. Dealing with the relationship between an African-American housemaid and her Jewish employers, it exposed the racial, social and economic tensions in 1960s America and the vivacious score even animated washing machines and hairdryers. MB Read the review.An act of theatrical bad faith, this brilliant and subversive piece by the devised theatre company Forced Entertainment shreds the social contract between performers and audience. Structured as a smarmy seaside variety entertainment, the show begins badly and gets much worse. There’s a balloon-clad ecdysiast who runs off in tears, a doll who tortures his ventriloquist, a mentalist who predicts the death of most everyone watching. The performers’ smiles contort into a rictus the sequins sparkle menacingly. Cruel, unsettling and often very funny, it attacks its spectators directly, upheaving dramatic expectations and disrupting audience complacency. AS Read the review.The concept behind Tim Crouch’s An Oak Tree is simple but brilliant: each night, a new, unrehearsed actor performs the show alongside Crouch, thus exposing the transformation that lies at the heart of all theatre. While it might sound like a cold intellectual exercise, the use of an unprepared and often slightly baffled performer poignantly speaks to the show’s themes of loss and grief, making it one of the century’s best marriages of form and content. CL Read the review.In random, debbie tucker green reinvigorated the monologue form, testing how many voices can be channelled through one performer. Each of the characters in this story of a family shattered by a random act of violence has a distinct way of speaking, yet they all cohere in one female figure who holds together their collective grief. Sadly, with violent crime on the rise, the play is as powerful and relevant as ever. CL Read the review.In Yasmina Reza’s play, two ostensibly civilised couples meet to sort out a playground punch-up by their respective offspring. Its beauty is that the pales and forts of reason quickly break down and bourgeois hypocrisy is exposed. Underrated because of her commercial success (Art, Life x 3), Reza is a razor-sharp analyst of middle-class manners whose work reveals a satirist’s savage indignation. MB Read the review.Roy Williams’ play still offers one of the most vivid accounts of the variety and depth of Anglicised racism. That racism may take the form of reflex bigotry, skin-deep liberalism or, since the play is set in a pub on the day England are playing Germany in a World Cup qualifier, barbaric tribalism. Football, for Williams, becomes a way of exposing the ugly face of the nation. MB Read the review.Loosely based on Bertolt Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children, Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer prize-winning play unfurls at Mama Nadi’s, a brothel and bar in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Here Mama Nadi and her “girls”, each an orphan of war, entertain soldiers on both sides, flirting for their lives. Never indulgent or exploitative, this shattering play explores how women assert themselves in a world ruled by men who use rape and mutilation as weapons. Nottage’s play never sanitises this violence, but it argues, via beautifully complicated characters, that survival, compassion and even love remain possible. AS Read the review.Much was made of Anne Washburn’s decision to imagine The Simpsons surviving the collapse of human civilisation, but really Mr Burns is about how cultures evolve and reinvent. Almost regardless of whether it’s Homer Simpson or the Homer of The Iliad who manages to escape apocalypse, the play wittily explores how these stories morph, mutate and lend meaning to human lives. And it’s theatrically audacious, concluding with an elaborate pop-culture opera. CL Read the review.This sweet and bitter musical, based on Alison Bechdel’s graphic novel memoir, tells twinned stories, one comic, one tragic. Alison – seen at three ages: Small, Medium and Big – describes her sexual awakening while trying to understand why her gay father, an English teacher and a funeral director, committed suicide. Jeanine Tesori’s delectable melodies and Lisa Kron’s lyrics, just on the elegant side of conversational, give the show a remarkable intimacy. The piece thrums with empathy for all its characters and the songs in which Alison discovers her lesbianism, the poignant Ring of Keys and the giddy Changing My Major, are pure joy. AS Read the review.Theatre history is a rich subject. Lolita Chakrabarti seized on the stunning story of the passions aroused by the London debut in 1833 of the African-American actor Ira Aldridge as Othello. His presence provoked professional bitchery, press venom and popular prejudice. But this was also a play about the nature of performance and a reminder that Aldridge was resented because, like all great actors, he was seen as a pioneering realist. MB Read the review.Can one still champion a play whose main character, Hector, likes copping a feel of boys’ balls? Absolutely, because Alan Bennett’s point is that an inspirational teacher may also be morally imperfect. But that is only one aspect of a richly erse comedy that deals with the covert eroticism of the teacher-pupil relationship, the overt elitism of the educational system and the debasement of culture by flashy presentation. MB Read the review.Rona Munro’s seven-and-a-half hour trilogy covered Scotland’s history from 1421-88. The overwhelming impression was of a kingdom beset by feudal infighting and of the inescapable solitude of monarchy. Presented by the national theatres of Scotland and Great Britain, Munro’s timely trilogy also raised serious questions about the huge potential and possible hazards of independence. MB Read the review.Inspired by Euripides’s tragedy Iphigenia in Aulis, Gary Owen delivered a blistering dispatch from modern-day Cardiff, capturing just one of the many British communities on the brink, ripped by isions and badly wounded by austerity. In the sacrificial Effie, who lives at a million miles an hour and gives the audience the finger, but hides a heart-bursting benevolence, he created one of the most enduring heroines of the century so far. Owen’s monologue starts with the rush of a boozy night out then stings with a hangover from hell. CW Read the review.David Ireland’s blackly comic play showed how a Protestant loyalist’s devotion to the unionist cause led him to murderously lunatic extremes. The play was almost a mirror image of McDonagh’s The Lieutenant of Inishmore in that it exposed the destructive absurdity of sectarian hatred. It also yielded a truly great performance by Stephen Rea, who unforgettably captured the melancholia behind the hero’s mania. MB Read the review.Punchdrunk’s beguiling show, based on several short stories of Edgar Allen Poe, occupied the Victorian-era Battersea Arts Centre. Sexy, scary, often hallucinatory and wholly immersive, it left masked ticket holders free to wander its atmospheric, lavishly decorated rooms or to chase after incestuous siblings and black cats (sometimes those characters chased back) before gathering everyone together for an orgiastic masquerade. At times, upon discovering a secret passage tucked inside a wardrobe, say, or suddenly hearing music issuing from a hidden music hall, The Masque of the Red Death could conjure the feeling of walking through one’s own dreams. AS Read the review.Kate Tempest has mastered and blurred an impressive range of forms: written poetry, spoken word, theatre, hip-hop and fiction. Brand New Ancients thrillingly mashed together poetry, drama and music, bringing an epic spirit to stories about ordinary people. The show throbbed with energy and compassion, placing audiences firmly in the shoes of its characters. Bold, lyrical and compelling, Brand New Ancients showcased a virtuosic storyteller at her best. CL Read the review.This pioneering verbatim musical showed how an Ipswich community reconstituted itself after the gruesome murder of five sex workers on a single street. Adam Cork’s score, deploying the everyday phrases of London Road residents collated by Alecky Blythe, acquired a fugal delicacy and opened up new possibilities for musical theatre: the savour of actuality, one felt, might one day supplant the narcissism of showbiz. MB Read the review.Florian Zeller’s plays, translated by Christopher Hampton, have captivated British audiences through their cryptic portrayals of personal crisis. This was his best yet because it explored love, loss, dementia and the difficulty of coming to terms with the death of a lifelong partner. As played by Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, it moved one to tears but also left one pleasantly perplexed about its ultimate meaning. MB Read the review.The heart often shrinks at the prospect of yet another adaptation of a novel, but Laura Wade’s take on a piece of unfinished Jane Austen juvenilia shone like a gem. Having summarised Austen’s plot in under a half-hour, Wade brilliantly turned the play into an argument between herself and the characters about their destiny. Like a heady mix of Luigi Pirandello and Tom Stoppard, the play opened up fascinating questions about the capacity of fictional figures to escape their author’s control. MB Read the review.David Harrower’s disturbing play offers a riveting study of sexual obsession. It deals with a fraught confrontation between a 28-year-old woman and a 56-year-old man who, 15 years earlier, had enjoyed a criminally transgressive relationship. Harrower suspends moral judgment to question our knee-jerk assumptions about the nature of adult guilt and adolescent innocence. MB Read the review.Switching between six establishments in two continents on a single day, Inua Ellams’s invigorating play showed how, for African men, barber shops are both pub and political platform. Soccer, social issues and the difficulties of father-son relationships were recurring themes. But the abiding image of Bijan Sheibani’s production, which incorporated uplifting music and dance, was of the barber shop as a place where you shed your locks but discover your identity. MB Read the review.Katori Hall (The Mountaintop) turns the story of the Marian apparitions that visited a trio of Rwandan schoolgirls in 1981 into a religious and political drama with echoes of George Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan and Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. Hall’s great achievement is that, without necessarily validating the visions, she shows how they reflected the country’s existing Tutsi-Hutu tensions and foresaw the horrific genocide to come. MB Read the review.Lucy Prebble’s was the first in a number of plays skewering corporate corruption following the financial crash. Dealing with the rise and fall of an overextended Texan energy company that started trading in the internet and even the weather, Prebble’s play was an exhilarating mix of political satire, modern morality and – in Rupert Goold’s production – Citizen Kane-like spectacle. MB Read the review.Playwriting debuts don’t come much better than this. Natasha Gordon took a theme explored by many other writers: what it means to lead a bicultural existence in which you are caught between immigrant tradition and the insistent present. Gordon gave it fizz and bounce by showing a London family’s ided reaction to the Jamaican custom of a nine-night funeral wake. Nothing was more touching than the sight of the family’s graduate daughter suspending her natural scepticism to acknowledge the power of her spiritual inheritance. MB Read the review.Joe Penhall’s compassion for those marginalised by society was seen at its best in this extraordinary play. It showed a young black man, who believed oranges are blue and Idi Amin was his father, being used as a ping-pong ball by two warring, white medical practitioners. Penhall nailed several issues: the myth of a tolerant community ready to receive people with a personality disorder, the high incidence of mental illness among members of the African-Caribbean population and the idea that all professions are a conspiracy against the laity. MB Read the review.Modern drama seems to oscillate between the minimal and the maximal. Matthew Lopez’s two-part, seven-hour play was emphatically in the latter camp. Dealing with the bitter inheritance of Aids and the spiritual qualities of a house, it was like a cross between Angels in America and Howards End. It teemed with narrative incident and impassioned debate. However, Paul Hilton’s portrayal of Morgan Forster’s quiet humanity is what sticks in the mind. MB Read the review.Set on a 50-acre farm in County Armagh in 1981, Jez Butterworth’s play had the richness and density of a good novel. It was partly about a reformed IRA gunman whose violent past is catching up with him, partly about the power of unspoken love and partly about the Hardy-esque rituals that give a rhythm to rural life. In an age of theatrical nouvelle cuisine, Butterworth’s play felt like a five-course feast. MB Read the review.It wasn’t the first show to put the audience in headphones, but it was the first to make such extraordinary use of binaural sound. The Complicité production matched the hallucinatory nature of Petru Popescu’s Amazon Beaming, a biography of the explorer Loren McIntyre, with a soundscape that got inside your head. Loops and vocal distortions turned an empty stage into a dense forest where Simon McBurney could ask questions about the ephemeral, the material and the telepathic. MF Read the review.What would happen if the UK’s future monarch refused to give royal assent to a bill he strongly opposed? Constitutional crisis, civil war and palace plotting, according to Mike Bartlett’s fascinating blank-verse play. The Shakespearean echoes, which embraced Macbeth and Richard II, were made even more evident by Tim Pigott-Smith’s deeply moving portrayal of the isolated and unloved insomniac king. MB Read the review.This is a confounding comedy of race. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s script eviscerates Dion Boucicault’s The Octoroon, an 1859 melodrama about forbidden love on a slave plantation. Clever and dangerous, the play is designed to unsettle its audience – and it does. Using blackface, whiteface, redface and an anarchic humour, it blows up conventional notions of identity. It also blows up a steamship. Woven through the script is an anguished meditation on how a black artist should live and work in a white world. “Hi, everyone,” a character known as BJJ says at the beginning. “I’m a ‘black playwright’. I don’t know exactly what that means.” AS Read the review.Lucy Kirkwood can do both intimate and epic. This was her most expansive play to date, charting the parallels and differences between the world’s two rival superpowers. In inidualist US, we saw a photographer garlanded for his pursuit of an exiled Tiananmen Square demonstrator in collectivist China, we watched a man punished for protesting about the smog-induced death of a neighbour. Today, as a trade war between the two nations accelerates, Kirkwood’s play looks ever more pertinent. MB Read the review.Charged with bringing the National Theatre of Scotland into being, Vicky Featherstone reckoned there might be a story to tell about the Black Watch regiment before it was subsumed into the Royal Regiment of Scotland. She asked playwright Gregory Burke and director John Tiffany to devise a soldier’s eye view of the battalion’s history right up to the still topical war in Iraq. Epic, hard-bitten and tender, this landmark production put the NTS on the map. MF Read the review.Caryl Churchill’s play hinged on a powerful juxtaposition. Four elderly women sit in a sunlit garden dwelling on times past, at one point even breaking into a version of Da Doo Ron Ron. Meanwhile, one periodically cuts through the chat to offer a vision, in seven monologues, of a world of flood, fire, thirst and starvation. This was no routine road to dystopia, but a wryly compassionate play about life’s soon-to-be-lost daily beauty. MB Read the review.Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin’s dizzily enjoyable musical about Roald Dahl’s telekinetic bookworm sings the importance of two invaluable resources: public libraries and arts subsidy. Produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company, it became a global sensation thanks to its sweetly spiky songs, empowering celebration of the imagination and brilliantly rebellious heroine who puts the “revolt” into revolting rhymes. While her mum is at the bingo, Dahl’s Matilda spends “two glorious hours” at the library. This gives the same pleasure in the theatre. CW Read the review.Class and sex intertwine beautifully in Peter Gill’s play, reminding us that, as a director, he rediscovered the forgotten dramas of DH Lawrence. Gill shows a Yorkshire farm-worker enjoying an affair with a London-based theatre man working on the medieval mystery plays. Ultimately, however, the two men are ided by geography and the historic assumption that, in England, art is the property of the middle classes. MB Read the review.Angry and ecstatic, this piece – first performed in eight three-hour chunks and finally assembled into one all-day, all-night, sleep-optional extravaganza – explores the fraught history of America, from the revolutionary war onwards, by revisiting the music these United States have loved. Taylor Mac, backed by a live band and joined by many guests, allots one hour for each decade, changing into new and increasingly jaw-dropping costumes (Machine Dazzle is the designer) as each segment concludes. A thrilling playwright and performer who identifies as queer and prefers the pronoun judy, Mac is no patriot, but the show’s scepticism is interleaved with joy. AS Read the review.If drama is a study in human desperation, then Annie Baker’s play was intensely dramatic. Not everyone, especially in New York, responded warmly to its more than three-hour running time. Others, though, were overwhelmed by Baker’s portrait of three loners working in a rundown Massachusetts movie house. Apart from its touching evocation of frustrated desire, the play also offered a passionate defence of movies shot on 35mm film stock in a digitised age. MB Read the review.Lucy Kirkwood’s probing, thoughtful play showed three nuclear physicists reunited in the wake of a disaster at a local power station. This opened up huge questions about the poisoned legacy we are handing on to future generations and about whether having children heightens or diminishes one’s sense of responsibility. It was an impressive, slow-burning work that confirmed Kirkwood’s status in the front rank of British dramatists. MB Read the review.Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hip-hop musical about the birth of a nation and the rise to power of “a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman” was hyped to the skies. It justified the drum-beating through its pulsating energy, dexterous lyrics and celebration of America’s overwhelming debt to immigrants. Only time will tell if it has a major impact on the musical form but, in performance, it proved an exhilarating rollercoaster of a show. MB Read the review.Jez Butterworth’s mesmerising study of a changing England was built around the figure of Johnny “Rooster” Byron, a Wiltshire Falstaff unforgettably played by Mark Rylance. Like Falstaff, Johnny was both a charismatic storyteller and a disturber of the piece, and that ambivalence was the key to Butterworth’s play. It lamented the loss of local customs but pinpointed the absurdity of seeking to preserve them in a modern, corporate age where even the morris dancers are brewery-sponsored. That double vision ran right through the play. We were spellbound by Johnny’s outrageous stories of meeting a giant on the A14 or being kidnapped by traffic wardens in Marlborough. At the same time, we saw that the folkloric heroes he sought to emulate were a thing of the past in our modern, mechanised world.

Questions remain as to whether it’s worth upgrading at all, however, if your iPhone is less than five years old. will have its own reviews of the new iPhones in the next week or so once they have gone on sale, but in the meantime here’s what those given early access by Apple had to say.Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 has a 6.1in LCD screen, two cameras on the back but the same processor and storage sizes as the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max.In our tests, the iPhone 11 easily lasted a full day at a time and then some. It’s possible you could manage to kill this battery in less than a day, but you’d have to really try. The battery life is great, just like the iPhone XR’s battery life was great.What’s less great is the fact that Apple is still putting its ancient 5W charger in the box, even though the iPhone 11 Pro has an 18W USB-C fast charger. If Apple isn’t going to update the entire line to a fast charger, it should just do the environment a favour and stop putting the 5W charger in the box entirely there are literally billions of them in the world, and odds are, you have more than one in a drawer already.In reality, the iPhone 11 has a display that will more than satisfy most users. It’s not as sharp in resolution as the likes of the iPhone 11 Pro, or the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 for example, and it doesn’t offer mobile HDR compatibility like these other devices either, but the iPhone 11 still offers a decent screen with ample brightness and arguably more realistic colours than the Pro models and other OLED smartphones.The omission of HDR on the iPhone 11 means that while it tries to deliver a HDR-like experience for compatible content, it’s not the real deal. Smart HDR pictures don’t pop as much when viewing on screen as they do on the iPhone 11 Pro, and you can’t see as much detail on a dark TV show or movie that’s available in HDR, as you can on the 11 Pro – but it’s also one of the few compromises the iPhone 11 makes to the Pro models.The wider-angled front-facing camera is welcome, and digitally zooms in or out to accommodate a wider view that fits in more people and background. The 12-megapixel front-facing camera looks better, and I was happy with the results, but you have to be artful with the wider camera. Sometimes I ended up looking like a little face in a mountain of shirt.My kids instantly started messing around with slow-motion selfie feature. Yes, that’s the Slofie. It’s not a Live Photo, though. It’s just a video mode. That makes it hard to do much with, because the file sizes get large. I do, however, have a lot of extended 240-fps slow-motion scenes of my kids sticking out their tongues.This year’s iPhone 11 has two rear lenses, a wide-angle lens and an ultrawide lens with a 120-degree field of view. Last year’s iPhone XR had a single lens, and any depth effects added to photos were done computationally. This means the iPhone 11 now captures enough information to take better photos from the start – and especially portrait photos.Case in point: last year’s iPhone XR could capture a portrait photo of a person but not a pet or object. The iPhone 11 now takes portrait photos of my cat, which he is pleased about. Just kidding: he is indifferent, per usual.The iPhone 11 is a very good camera, and in a lot of situations it even performed better than last year’s top-of-the-line iPhone XS. But the iPhone 11 Pro takes noticeably better photos, whether standard photos, portrait images, or night mode pics.Like the XR and 5c series before it, a large part of the iPhone 11’s appeal lies in its range of six shades: red, black, white, yellow, green and purple. This is the first ever purple iPhone, and Apple has chosen the Instagram-baiting shade of lilac popularised by the likes of Ariana Grande and South Korean pop sensations BTS – Generation Z’s equivalent of millennial pink.It’s pretty – a stylish splash of lavender Apple knows will have aesthetically-minded iPhone owners clamouring to upgrade (as evidenced by its new range of transparent cases). These are phones to be shown off, not hidden behind rubber or leather sheaths, and even if you do cover it up with a case, Apple is banking on the satisfaction of owning a phone in a colour you’re attached to.Overall the iPhone 11 is a triumph for Apple – if, for nothing else, the fact it’s managed to lower the price year-on-year. We feel enough people are going to be won over by the hard-working camera … and the safety that buying a modern smartphone gives you.You should be able to achieve years of use from this phone, and sure, you could also consider the iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want more power and higher spec, but we found the iPhone 11 to be fun to use and often outperformed what we would expect given the price – and that’s a feat some wouldn’t have expected from Apple.Based on my tests of the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, the answer is no. Don’t get me wrong: the newest models are nice. Apple has made them speedier, improved the cameras and lengthened their battery life. The new lineup also starts at a lower price of $700, down from $750 a year ago, which is a relief in an era of skyrocketing smartphone costs.But none of this is enough to warrant an immediate upgrade if you have had your smartphone for only two years. The latest iPhones just aren’t a big leap forward from last year’s iPhones or even the iPhone X from 2017.So here’s what I ultimately suggest: you should definitely upgrade if your current device is at least five years old. The iPhone 11 models are all a significant step up from those introduced in 2014. But for everyone else with smartphones from 2015 or later, there is no rush to buy. Instead, there is more mileage and value to be had out of the excellent smartphone you already own.The £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro and £1,149 11 Pro Max top the iPhone 11 with higher resolution 5.8in and 6.5in OLED screens respectively. They also have a new triple camera system on the back – their main differentiator over the significantly cheaper model.The iPhone 11 Pro Max I’ve been using every day for a week has consistently run for 12 to 14 hours on a single charge, with over 10 hours of screen-on time reported in the battery settings per 24-hour period.That’s compared to eight to 10 hours of battery life at most for my iPhone XS Max, which is a marked improvement. It’s not enough to make me stop charging at my desk throughout the day, and I’ll definitely still carry a battery pack on trips.Apple has chosen to stick to the same resolution as last year’s handsets but has spruced them up with a new OLED panel with a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio called Super Retina XDR. In practice, this means the displays are both bolder and brighter and display colours more accurately.I found this was best exemplified when examining skin tones in the same pictures side-by-side with the iPhone XS Max. Caucasian skin on the XS Max appears pinker and more flushed, whereas the same picture looks truer-to-life. Likewise, the 11 Pro Max picks out facial highlights and hair undertones not as apparent in the same picture over on the XS Max. It’s a small difference, but an impressive one.This year’s most expensive iPhone is the $1,449 (£1,499) iPhone Pro Max with 512GB of storage. Even with 256GB of storage – the minimum you’ll likely want for a high-end phone like this – it will set you back $1,249 (£1,299). There are two main reasons to go for this year’s most extreme iPhone: either you want that larger OLED display (2,688×1,242 versus 2,436×1,125 for the Pro) or you want that extra hour of battery life.I wouldn’t want to spend this much. But if you really are using your phone as a professional camera and you want to see every pixel, you want the best viewfinder and editing display you can get. And, well, this would be that phone. It’s also more fun for movies and games, but at these prices, I’d just buy a separate iPad for that.Overall, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is a real step forward, and the most advanced iPhone yet. However, when thinking about what’s truly new here, we weren’t able to single out much beyond the improved camera (especially night mode) and the slightly upgraded cinematic experience.If you want to save some money, we’d suggest checking out the iPhone 11 – while we constantly found little nuggets of impressive performance throughout our testing of the 11 Pro Max, we couldn’t shake the feeling that this is really only a phone for the Apple fan who wants the best of everything, with no compromises.While Apple says frequently that its integrated hardware and software enable it to do magical things with cameras – and in some cases, that’s true – that doesn’t mean every shot taken on the iPhone 11 Pro phones was the best photo.In some cases, the photos I took on the iPhone 11 Pro Max were clearly sharper, brighter, and even more (you hate to say it) professional-looking than the iPhone 11 photos of the same scenes or subjects. The iPhone 11 Pro Max captured the best portrait mode photo of my colleague Lydia, showing accurate colours, picking up on details like wisps of hair and freckles, and handling highlights and sunlight well. A beach sunset photo captured on the same phone expertly captured the contrast between dark rocks, a glassy ocean and the sunburnt sky. A photo of yaki onigiri captured in harsh overhead light showed excellent detail, right down to the charred rice.But when pitted against other leading smartphones, the iPhone 11 Pro Max wasn’t always the standout. The Google Pixel 3, a less expensive and soon-to-be-outdated phone, took better, crisper photos of a floral arrangement in a very dark bar. An iPhone 11 Pro Max photo of my friend Kayla, captured in a dark sushi restaurant, showed a lot of detail in easy-to-miss spots like her hands, or the slight wrinkles of her shirt. But Kayla, a video producer, and I both agreed that the colour and temperature of the photo was off, whereas the Pixel 3’s photo was more true-to-life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca904f27648161836d90eecaf7ff58ca860ceeb/0_200_6095_3658/master/6095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0b7e7e4f04b9f681984a3f3776a5ae5","title":"revealed catastrophic effects working facebook moderator","story":"Exclusive: Job has left some ‘addicted’ to extreme material and pushed others to far rightThe task of moderating Facebook continues to leave psychological scars on the company’s employees, months after efforts to improve conditions for the company’s thousands of contractors, the  has learned.A group of current and former contractors who worked for years at the social network’s Berlin-based moderation centres has reported witnessing colleagues become “addicted” to graphic content and hoarding ever more extreme examples for a personal collection. They also said others were pushed towards the far right by the amount of hate speech and fake news they read every day.They describe being ground down by the volume of the work, numbed by the graphic violence, nudity and bullying they have to view for eight hours a day, working nights and weekends, for “practically minimum pay”.A little-discussed aspect of Facebook’s moderation was particularly distressing to the contractors: vetting private conversations between adults and minors that have been flagged by algorithms as likely sexual exploitation.Gina, a contractor, said: “I think it’s a breach of human rights. You cannot ask someone to work fast, to work well and to see graphic content. The things that we saw are just not right.”The workers, whose names have been changed, were speaking on condition of anonymity because they had signed non-disclosure agreements with Facebook. Daniel, a former moderator, said: “We are a sort of vanguard in this field … It’s a completely new job, and everything about it is basically an experiment.”John, his former colleague, said: “I’m here today because I would like to avoid other people falling into this hole. As a contemporary society, we are running into this new thing – the internet – and we have to find some rules to deal with it.“It’s important to create a team, for example in a social network, aiming to protect users from abusers, hate speech, racial prejudice, better pornographic software, etc. But I think it’s important to open a debate about this job. We need to share our stories, because people don’t know anything about us, about our job, about what we do to earn a living.”Some of the moderators’ stories were similar to the problems experienced in other countries. Daniel said: “Once, I found a colleague of ours checking online, looking to purchase a Taser, because he started to feel scared about others. He confessed he was really concerned about walking through the streets at night, for example, or being surrounded by foreign people.“Maybe because all this hate speech we have to face every day affects our political view somehow. So a normal person, a liberal person, maybe also a progressive person, can get more conservative, more concerned about issues like migrants for example. Indeed, many of the hate speech contents we receive on a daily basis are fake news … which aim to share very particular political views.”In February, the technology site the Verge produced one of the first behind-the-scenes reports from a US Facebook contractor. Similar to their Berlin colleagues, the Americans reported that “the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually led them to embrace fringe views”, and that a former moderator “now sleeps with a gun at his side” after he was traumatised by a video of a stabbing.Others were dealing with trauma by self-medicating. Just as the Arizona moderators were reportedly turning to drugs and alcohol, so were those in Germany. “I saw a lot of big consumer drugs in the company,” Daniel said. “We don’t have any way to destress. The company, technically, is against drugs.”When trying to go down a more legitimate route of self-help, the American moderators complained about the psychological help that was provided. “The on-site counsellors were largely passive,” the Verge reporter Casey Newton wrote, “relying on workers to recognise the signs of anxiety and depression and seek help.”Berlin moderators were also critical of the counselling services provided and suggested they leaned too heavily on the state’s universal healthcare.The Verge report appeared to trigger reforms. Moderators in Berlin said after the article was published there had been immediate interest from Facebook’s head office in their workload. Previously, they had been required to moderate 1,000 pieces of content a day – more than one every 30 seconds over an eight-hour shift.In February, an official from Facebook’s Dublin office visited, John said. “This person after this meeting decided to take off the limit of 1,000. We didn’t have any limit for a while, but now they have re-established another limit. The limit now is between 400 and 500 tickets.” The new cap – or number of tickets – was half that of the previous one but still required workers achieve about a ticket a minute. However, that volume of work was what their American colleagues had faced before the reforms.Berlin moderators have discussed whether to seek help from the unions, but say the nature of the work makes it difficult. Gina said: “I wouldn’t say no one is interested, but no one has the possibility to do something for real.”John added: “They are so tired.”While the moderators agreed such work was necessary they said the problems were fixable. Daniel said: “I think it’s important to open a debate about this job,” adding that the solution was simple – “hire more people”.In a statement, Facebook said: “Content moderators do vital work to keep our community safe, and we take our responsibility to ensure their wellbeing incredibly seriously. We work closely with our partners to ensure they provide the support people need, including training, psychological support and technology to limit their exposure to graphic content.“Content moderation is a new and challenging industry, so we are always learning and looking to improve how it is managed. We take any reports that our high standards are not being met seriously and are working with our partner to look into these concerns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2af98ec957ceb1bfedc3cc93f7a83d564a068f4/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=157409f857f85a08300ec63385d0e56b","title":"japan rugby world cup host city guide tokyo osaka yokohama","story":"With the Rugby World Cup about to kick off, Olivia Lee asks locals from the nine cities hosting home nations matches for top places to eat and drink, and the must-see sightsBy Manami Miura, award-winning sake sommelier at the Ginza Kimijimaya liquor store, instagramsakephygramMy city in a nutshellTokyo is a city of gigantic proportions: 47 neighbourhoods slotting together like parts of an elaborate puzzle, home to more than 4,000 shrines and temples, 6,000 parks, and 300,000 restaurants (10 times as many as New York). Quiet shrines stand near neon-lit electronics shops, and serene parks edge up against alleyways lined with late-night ramen bars. But it wasn’t always this way: in the 1600s, when Tokyo was still called Edo, it was nothing but a tiny fishing village, until the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu decided to build a castle here. In 1868, it was made the capital, and it is now among the largest cities in the world.If you do one thingAsk 100 people what to do in Tokyo and you’ll probably get 100 different answers. I tell people to walk around Ginza. This central neighbourhood is one of Japan’s wealthiest postcodes, where glossy department stores and high-end brands are housed in many of Tokyo’s prettiest buildings, blending the best of Japanese fashion, design and cuisine – it’s also the heart of Tokyo’s sushi culture. Some of the greatest sushi restaurants on Earth are here, including the immortalised shop of Jiro Ono, star of the Jiro Dreams of Sushi documentary.While in Ginza, also visit Sony Park – a quirky urban space that often hosts live music – as well as the tiny shrine of Toyoiwa Inari, hidden down a very narrow alley. Also stop for a drink at Nissan Crossing, a cafe where you can have your face etched on top of your latte in macchi-art for ¥400 (£3).My favourite place to eatA small restaurant in Tokyo’s Ebisu neighbourhood called GEM by Moto. Diners squeeze in on stools around the hardwood counter as they watch owner and sake sommelier Marie Chiba at work. This year, Marie was awarded the Sake Samurai award – one of the most prestigious achievements in the sake industry – for her unique pairings at GEM, selecting sake for each customer based on their food choices from the regularly changing blackboard menu. Her most famous pairing, which you can ask for, is that of milky-white doburoku (unfiltered homebrew sake) with a blue cheese and ham cutlet. On the restaurant’s white walls, you’ll find scrawled messages from Marie’s many sake brewers, who travel from across the country to become customers themselves.• Small plates from £3.80, 1 Chome-30-9 Ebisu, Shibuya City, on FacebookWhere to stayA trip to Tokyo wouldn’t be complete without dipping a toe into the city’s slightly stranger side. A stay at a Henn-na Hotel (meaning strangeweird hotel) will certainly allow you to do that. This chain, of which there are several branches across Tokyo, is almost solely run by robots: some in the shape of people, some in the shape of dinosaurs. You are generally checked in by a robot at reception, with a porter robot to carry your things to your room (plus robotic fish in the fish tank). The latest Henn-na Hotel, which opened on 1 September in Asakusa, even has holographic robot staff who flicker in front of you on the walls. You probably wouldn’t want to spend more than a night or two there, but the rooms are affordable and are in great locations, from Ginza to Maihama (by Tokyo Disneyland). If the robot novelty doesn’t appeal, I also recommend Remm in Hibiya (doubles from £85), a modern hotel that provides a quiet, comfortable night’s sleep in the heart of the city, with rooms featuring rain showers and massage chairs.• h-n-h.jpen,doubles from £55What the guidebooks overlookTokyo is often said to be the foodie capital of the world, with more Michelin stars than any other city on Earth. But less appreciation is given to the city’s creative brewers, of which there are hundreds. My favourites include Brewin’ Bar in Ginza, where you can try home-brewed craft beers (£6) an amazing urban winery called Fujimaru in Kiyosumi-Shirakawa, with both a restaurant and a wine tasting room and Wakaze, a brewery that does pop-ups around the city, serving deliciously sour oak barrel-aged sake.Head north to nearby Ibaraki prefecture, where nature is in abundance. This is where you’ll find the beautiful Tsukimachi waterfall, one of Japan’s 88 ancient power spots. Here people practise a Buddhist ritual called Takigyo, known as “waterfall meditation”, a cleansing of the mind and soul achieved by standing under the powerful – and very cold – water for anything from several minutes to several hours (something only committed monks achieve). You can rent a traditional shiro shozoku karate-style outfit and try it for yourself (I did it in August), warming up after at Momiji-en, a soba (buckwheat noodle) restaurant that overlooks the maple tree valley. About 12 miles away, you’ll find Japan’s highest bungee jump, which sees visitors throw themselves off a 100-metre-high suspension bridge above colourful Ryujin Gorge. To get to Ibaraki, take the 90-minute Limited Express train from Tokyo to Mito, then the 90-minute local Suigun Line train to Shimonomiya station. Tsukimachi waterfall is a 1½-mile walk from there. Alternatively, hire a car in Mito for easy access to Ibaraki’s more rural reaches.Inspiration There are plenty of great Instagram accounts to follow for tips on Tokyo, including photographer @tokyo_one, who shares beautiful imagery, and @bunnytokyo who shares interesting stories. If you can get your hands on a copy, I also recommend the book series Tokyo Artrip. The books, written in Japanese on one side and English on the other, highlight great places to experience everything in Tokyo from sake and green tea to architecture and antiques.By Emma Sato, photographer living in Yokohama, @gomphotographyMy city in a nutshell Yokohama is Japan’s second-largest city: it has one of the largest expat communities in the country – and the largest Chinatown. It may be less than an hour by train from the capital Tokyo (it is actually part of the Greater Tokyo area), but feels far more laid-back – the streets are uncrowded, easy to walk through and dotted with street art and cool cafes. The growing number of microbreweries in the city add to this youthful spirit, and there are beer festivals throughout the year, including an annual Oktoberfest.If you do one thingSpend the evening in Minato Mirai 21, Yokohama’s harbour area. At night, the sea reflects the city lights like a kaleidoscope. To see the skyline in full, jump on the ferris wheel (£5.30), a 15-minute loop that scoops you up among the skyscrapers. It’s also worth viewing the ferris wheel from afar – it lights up in five-minute displays on each quarter-hour. The best spots to watch from are either Osanbashi Pier, which juts 50 metres into the water, or Manyo Club (£19), an onsen (hot-spring) facility that has skyline views from the baths. Manyo also has footbaths outside, so you can roll up your jeans and sit back to watch the show.My favourite place to eat I love a yakitori restaurant called Sumibi Yakitori Azume, where chicken is grilled on skewers over charcoal (yaki: cooked over heat tori: chicken). There are several tables, but sit at the 10-seater bar if you want a front-row view of the chef turning each skewer on the flames. Almost every part of the chicken is available, from the crispy skin to the liver. Wash it down with a local sake or sweet plum wine – the bar is lined with bottles.Where to stayProstyle Ryokan is a Japanese-Western fusion hotel that celebrates the fact that Yokohama was the first city in Japan to open its port to the outside world, back in 1859. The hotel’s design reflects this blending of cultures, from the sunken earth floors of traditional Japanese homes to the Western-style bedrooms, with corridors lit by refurbished gas lamps brought to Japan from the west in 1872. In the lobby, you can listen to curated playlists made by the hotel staff, using headphones plugged into record players. They also offer free smartphones for guests to use out and about during their stay. • prostyleryokan, doubles from £76 room-onlyWhat the guidebooks overlook Yokohama’s Koganecho neighbourhood was the city’s red-light district until the government set about gutting the local brothels in 2006, turning them into creative studios and workspaces. Today, the neighbourhood, which lines the northern banks of the Ooka River, is a great place to stroll around, stopping in at the art shops and galleries, or admiring the bright murals painted on the walls.Catch the Shinkansen (bullet train) to Hakone, a striking onsen town less than an hour away with a great open-air museum, home to an enormous collection of artwork from the likes of Picasso and Henry Moore, as well as more than 1,000 statues in the sprawling grounds. Hakone’s real lure, though, is its Mount Fuji views. To take in all the sights (including designated “Fuji-viewing” spots), follow the “Hakone loop” – a day-long route that winds gently through the mountains and lakes via train, tram, cable car, enormous pirate-styled ship and bus. Don’t leave without trying the famous black eggs of Owakudani, cooked in sulphur water. Locals believe eating one will add seven years to your life. The Hakone Free Pass (£39) allows for unlimited travel in the Hakone area for two consecutive days.Inspiration Follow: @in_suke_gram, who posts artistic photographs of the city.

The cold Sea of Okhotsk, to the north, has some of the world’s richest fishing waters, and Sapporo is known for its seafood – especially crab, served at all-you-can-eat crab buffets across the city. It was also the birthplace of the eponymous beer in 1876, one of the four big beer companies in Japan (alongside Asahi, Kirin and Suntory). The red-brick Sapporo Beer Museum (free) is a popular spot. The best thing about Sapporo though is the weather: heavy snowfall in winter, when the city hosts Japan’s largest snow festival (4-11 February 2020), then a balmy climate in summer, far from the sweltering heat further south. But Hokkaido is perhaps at its best in autumn, when the trees turn bright red and yellow. And unlike further south, where the maples often stay green until late November, the transformation generally begins in late October.If you do one thingWalk down Ganso Ramen Yokocho, a narrow, lantern-lit alleyway home to 17 traditional hole-in-the-wall ramen shops. It’s Sapporo’s “original” ramen street, where miso ramen – Hokkaido’s famed noodle dish, often topped with “butter corn” – is said to have originated, spurred on by the need for a heartier broth in cold winters. The street looks almost the same as it did in the 1950s – except now there are ticket machines where you choose your order and pay. Most of the shops are tiny, seating around six people, so it’s not uncommon to queue.• 3 Chome Minami 5 Jonishi, Chuo WardMy favourite place to eatHokkaido is one of the few places in Japan where you’ll find lamb on the menu (or see sheep in a field): the animals were introduced to Hokkaido in 1857. Now, one of the island’s staple dishes is Genghis Khan (pronounced jingisukan) – grilled lamb or mutton in a sticky marinade. In Sapporo, there are plenty of Genghis Khan restaurants, but the tiny Sapporo Genghis Khan Main Branch is my favourite. It’s a real locals’ bar, with 18 seats crammed inside, and grills set up to cook in front of you. A 130g plate of lamb costs £7.50 English menus available on request.• 6 Chome Minami 5 Jonishi, Chuo WardWhat the guide books overlook Sapporo Art Park, about 15km south of the city centre, has nearly 100 acres of landscaped gardens, outdoor museums and craft studios offering workshops such as woodworking or weaving. The Sculpture Garden, with its 74 striking works of art from 64 artists, is a real highlight its unusual statues stand in contrast to the park’s colourful foliage.• artpark.or.jp, Open 9.45am-5pm, free entry (workshops are chargeable).Where to stay Nakamuraya Ryokan is a charming inn about 10 minutes’ walk from JR Sapporo train station. It’s not five-star luxury, but it’s rare to find accommodation as traditional as this close to the city centre. The ryokan was founded in 1903 and has been in the same family ever since. The guest rooms have tatami mats, with roll-out futons in place of western-style beds, and there’s an on-site 24-hour public bathhouse. It also offers a “hairy crab experience”, where visitors can learn how to eat this Hokkaido speciality the local way (600g crab plus instruction, £41).• nakamurayaryokan, rooms sleeping up to four from £60 Shikotsu-Toya national park is only an hour’s drive from Sapporo city, but a true Japanese wilderness. There’s nearly 1,000 square kilometres to explore, dotted with steaming volcanos, caldera lakes and forest-covered mountains. Make a beeline for Lake Shikotsu, one of the deepest in Japan, ringed by three volcanoes: Eniwa, Fuppushi and Tarumae. In autumn, the trees around the lake turn a brilliant burnt orange, intensified by the lake’s mirror-smooth surface. After a day of hiking, stop to soak at Marukoma Onsen (£7.50 public bath, £19 private) on the north shore. The open-air hot-spring baths come down almost to the lake’s edge.Inspiration Read: The Rurubu Omotenashi Travel Guide to Hokkaido – a chaotically colourful but compelling book detailing what to see, eat, buy and do in Hokkaido’s various regions. Follow: @raamen_jyoshis, an account dedicated to finding the best bowls of ramen in Sapporo.

Before it moved there, the city was called Koromo but in 1959 – as an acknowledgement of the economic prosperity the motor chain had brought to this otherwise agricultural community – it was renamed Toyota. Many visitors skip Toyota in favour of nearby Nagoya, but that is doing the city a disservice. It has art galleries, gardens, historic temples and an interesting local craft culture, not to mention scenic mountains and valleys on the doorstep.If you do one thing Korankei valley is a pretty ravine carved by the gushing Tomoe River, and a riverside footpath leads from one end of the valley to the other, past the 254-metre peak of Mount Inari. The route winds over the scarlet Taigetsukyo Bridge (a great spot for photos) and past Kojakuji Temple, part-way up the slope under a canopy of maples. There are over 4,000 maple trees in the valley, each turning like traffic lights from green to orange to red as the year progresses. It’s an explosion of colour so dramatic that thousands of visitors from across Japan come each year to witness it.My favourite place to eatUnachu is a traditional restaurant that serves the most delicious hitsumabushi – a regional speciality of grilled eel on white rice. We love eel in Japan (the Japanese consume three-quarters of the total global eel catch) and Toyota’s prefecture, Aichi, is one of the main eel-producing regions in the country. The eel is grilled on skewers over charcoal and dipped in a soy-based glaze, making it crispy on the outside and delicately soft inside. It’s served with a variety of bowls and condiments (£26). The idea is to ide the eel into three portions: the first is to be eaten alone with rice the second with the accompaniments (nori, spring onions and wasabi) and the third with a green tea-based dashi sauce, poured out of a teapot. The restaurant itself is very pretty, with timber frames, tatami mats and sliding shoji doors.• unachu, around £26 a headWhere to stayToyota’s accommodation is dominated by “business hotels”, aimed at travellers who visit for work. For a place with a little more character, try Sanage Onsen Hotel Kinsenkaku in the countryside about seven miles north of the city. In Japan, traditional rooms are typically measured by the number of tatami mats they can fit (as opposed to square metres): here, all rooms consist of eight mats, suitable for up to four guests sleeping on roll-out futons. The hotel is particularly proud of its onsen: the natural water contains radon, which is said to promote healing. You can bathe in it, but also drink it to absorb the minerals – it’s the first resort water in Aichi prefecture designated safe to drink by the local government. • doubles from £212 with breakfast and dinnerWhat the guidebooks overlook A small mountain on the outskirts of the city called Mount Sanage. It’s only 30 minutes by bus, but it’s like a different world, with shaded forests, tiny mountain shrines and far-reaching views over Aichi prefecture. I love to come here to run or hike, far from the noise of the city.Moving on Take a 90-minute train and ferry trip to the tiny art island of Sakushima – one of three islands in the Aichi archipelago, with a population of just 300. In 2000, Sakushima began a regeneration project to attract visitors, displaying over 20 modern art installations in the wilderness. There’s no public transport on the 1½-mile-long island, but it’s easy to walk or cycle the looping roads and footpaths, following an art map from the information centre. Circling the entire island on foot will take around two hours. In places, it’s as if you’ve walked into a Japanese video game, exploring fantastical art structures in the pretty island scenery.Inspiration Follow: @88mercury, based in neighbouring city Nagoya, takes beautiful images of Aichi prefecture, with lots of pictures shot in Toyota.By Ami Takemoto, contortionist and performing artist in circus and dance shows across Japan, @ami_takemotoMy city in a nutshell In a country not known for its cultural ersity, Kobe stands out. After Yokohama, it was one of the first ports to open up to the outside world (in 1868) and it has worn its multiculturalism as a badge of honour ever since. Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of this is the number of Western-style patisserie shops – I recommend L’Avenue – and the sprawling Nankinmachi, or Chinatown. But Kobe also has strong Japanese traditions: most notably the production of nihonshu, or sake as it’s known in the west (sake in fact just means alcohol in Japanese). Kobe’s Nada district is the top nihonshu-producing region in the country, with many breweries open for tours and samples.If you do one thing The view from the top of Mount Maya, just north of the city, is incredible – especially at night, earning it the nickname “the $10m view”. The most rewarding way to reach the peak is to hike, setting off mid-afternoon. The easy-to-follow route begins just behind Shin-Kobe station and takes around three hours. On the way up, you’ll pass the Nunobiki waterfalls – their misty white water a cooling refresher on the steep slope. Finally, you’ll reach the Kikuseidai observation platform, where the view unfolds. Catch the 20-minute Maya Viewline cable car back down – or up, if you don’t fancy the hike (£3.30 one-way).My favourite place to eatKobe beef is a variety of wagyu – the highly prized beef known for its succulent, buttery texture. If you’re looking to splash out, there are lots of restaurants offering tasting courses – the two-Michelin-starred Aragawa, for example, will set you back £270 a head. Wanto Burger is one place to try the city’s namesake meat for a fraction of the cost. It’s an American-style diner and serves a Super Wanto burger, with sliced Kobe beef steaks, in a huge bun for £28.• wantoburgerWhere to stayNegiya Ryofukaku is a ryokan in Arima, one of Japan’s better-known onsen towns, around 30 minutes from Kobe. Though it doesn’t have the city-centre convenience, it makes up for it with traditional Japanese charm. Rooms are quintessential Japan, with neat tatami mats, low chabudai tables and sliding paper shoji doors. You can don a traditional yukata (Japanese robe) and shuffle between the steaming open-air baths – one of which has “golden” water thanks to its rich iron content – and the dining room, where an impeccably presented multi-course kaiseki-style dinner is served. In autumn, the entire resort is enveloped in orange maple trees. • Doubles from £150, half-board available, negiyaryokanWhat the guidebooks overlook Kikusui-Sarou – a traditional Japanese dessert shop beside Kobe’s iconic Minatogawa Shrine. When the shrine was built in 1872, Kikusui-Sarou’s shopkeeper donated a tile for the roof as a gesture of goodwill. Today, the shop’s signature treat is their “gilded rice cracker”, baked in the shape of that roof tile. It’s a nice place to sip green tea and sample a range of Japanese sweets.3-15 -3, Tamondori, Chuo-ku Kobe, HyogoTake a 40-minute train ride west to the city of Himeji, with its 400-year-old castle – Japan’s only Unesco-protected castle. This wooden structure on a hill above the city, tiered like an elegant white wedding cake, is one of Japan’s 12 original castles – and, unlike most others, never had to be rebuilt after a natural disaster or war. From the top there are sweeping views across the labyrinth of defences below and out over Himeji. The castle gardens reach their peak during the spring cherry blossom season, when queues form outside the grounds, but they’re an enchanting place to stroll the rest of the year as you peer up at the majestic “White Heron”, as the castle is also known. • japan-guide, tickets from £7.50Inspiration Follow: @kobe_style, showcasing the city’s best food and drink spots. Also check out @kobe_cafe, introducing Kobe’s best cafes, with each post featuring detailed information on pricing, opening hours and location.My city in a nutshell Shizuoka City, which sits on Sugura Bay, is often overlooked by tourists rushing from Tokyo to Kyoto or Osaka. But it’s a great place to spend a few days, visiting tourist-free temples, wandering the coastline and staring up at Mount Fuji whenever the clouds clear. In the surrounding countryside, the hills are covered with green tea bushes, strawberry fields and wasabi farms – the land is fertile because of the mountain spring water and cool coastal climate.If you do one thing Kunozan Toshogu shrine, on the edge of the city, is an ornate complex overlooking Suruga Bay from the side of Mount Kuno. The scarlet buildings of the shrine, dedicated to the powerful Edo leader Tokugawa Ieyasu, stand under a thick tree covering, with colourful paintings, copper lanterns and gold carvings. The ascent to the shrine zigzags over 1,000 stone steps, but for those who don’t want to sweat, there’s the Nihondaira Ropeway (£8 return), a cable car that dangles you above the forested slopes. On clear days, the views sweep across the tea fields and ocean to Mount Fuji.My favourite place to eatHug Hop, a craft beer bar five minutes’ walk from Shizuoka station, serves predominantly Shizuoka-brewed beer, from makers such as Baird Beer. There is also a regularly changing menu of pub dishes, like Japanese curry and pork belly (from £3). Beer names are written on a large blackboard in English, and there are often live music events. • On Facebook, @hughopWhat the guidebooks overlook Ethicus Coffee Roaster – a really cool coffee shop in the centre of Shizuoka. The owner, Yoshiya Yamazaki, is passionate about coffee, selecting the beans before roasting them himself. The shop is chic and minimalist, with an enormous open-plan kitchen where you can watch the coffee experiments take place.• 2-21-12 Takajo Aoi-ku @ethicus.jpWhere to stay Hotel Garden Square, a few minutes’ walk from Shizuoka central station, is smart and modern, with spacious rooms looking out on to the city. But it is the neighbouring garden and kaiseki restaurant, Fugetsuro, owned by the same family, that make it stand out. The garden, with its waterfall-fed pond and bamboo groves, was created at the end of the Edo period (in the 18th century). The restaurant serves seasonal dishes so pretty they look like they’ve been painted on the plate (eight items from £45). Hotel guests have access to the garden, which is otherwise off-limits.• doubles from £62 room-onlyFujikawaguchiko is a lakeside town in the northern foothills of Mount Fuji, and there are few places in Japan that offer such a close-up view of the famous peak. There are bikes to hire for a ride around Lake Kawaguchi, and plenty of boat trips. Still days see the phenomenon of sakasa Fuji, or “upside-down Fuji”, where the lake creates a perfect mirror image. The Mount Kachi Kachi cable car runs 400 metres up to an opposing peak for panoramic views (£6 return). Fuji Q Highland (£43) is Japan’s premier adrenaline theme park, with some of the most spine-tingling rides on the planet, including a rollercoaster with the world’s fastest acceleration and largest loop.

It’s not a pretty city – more a blur of concrete tower blocks and wide-laned roads – but its proximity to some of Kyushu’s wildest landscapes makes it a great base to explore the island’s wider reaches and go hiking, canyoning and wild swimming. And thanks to the same geothermal activity that carved these landscapes, Oita has another very tempting reason to visit: hot springs. It’s Japan’s top onsen spot, with more hot-spring facilities than anywhere else in the country.If you do one thing Go to an onsen: my favourite is Hyotan, just north of the city in Beppu. There are eight different onsen under one roof, from steaming open-air baths to sunamushi, where you’re buried up to your neck in hot sand. But onsen culture doesn’t just mean bathing: this area also has onsen jigoku or “hot spring hells” – places where hot sulphurous water (definitely not for swimming in) spills through cracks in the earth to create the most vibrant (and smelly) coloured lakes, from cobalt to deep red. They’re also hot enough to cook with. At Jigoku Mushi Kobo Kannawa, you can order (or take your own) vegetables and meat to steam in the water, which reaches temperatures of 98C (20 minutes’ use from £2.50).My favourite place to eat Usuki Fugu Yamadaya restaurant in Oita’s Miyakomachi area has a sister branch in nearby Usuki (the original store) and two in Tokyo, one of which has three Michelin stars (and, unsurprisingly, prices to match). The Usuki one is known for fugu, the pufferfish banned from consumption through the Edo period due to the number of fatalities from its ovaries and liver, which contain a poison 13 times stronger than arsenic. Even now, the Japanese emperor is forbidden by law from eating it. It’s only served at restaurants with a special licence (taking around three years to earn), which verifies the chef’s ability to prepare it safely. Its fugu course (from £72) includes the fish in its many forms.• 4-11-14, Nishiazabu, OitaWhat the guidebooks overlookA little restaurant called Okamotoya on a hill above Beppu. Outside, you can walk around the exposed sulphuric jigoku – bubbling and steaming like a giant witch’s cauldron – or stop to soak in their huge onsen, with views across Beppu Bay. My favourite reason to visit is the custard puddings, cooked using jigoku mushi (“hell steaming”) in the potent natural steam.• 4 Kumi, Myoban, BeppuA 60-minute train ride away is Yufuin, a small town at the foot of the twin-peaked Mount Yufu that’s consistently ranked as one of the top onsen towns in Japan. Yufuin’s architecture is traditional, from old stone farmhouses to elegant ryokans, but the boutique shops and trendy cafes give the town a bohemian flair. It’s a great place to explore on foot, dipping into the many craft shops and studios, where you can see people practise everything from pottery to washi (Japanese paper-making). Spend an hour crafting chopsticks at Hashiya Ichizen (£20), then have lunch at Izumi Soba, a traditional soba noodle shop by Lake Kinrinko on the edge of town.Inspiration Follow: @foodies_oita – a great Instagram page if you’re interested in finding restaurants that aren’t in the guidebooks. Each post includes the name of the cafe or restaurant in English, as well as a detailed description about the place and food (written in Japanese but translatable via the Instagram app).My city in a nutshell Fukuoka is the largest city on the southerly island of Kyushu – a five-hour Shinkansen (bullet train) ride south of Tokyo. Despite the city’s size (it’s home to 1.6 million people), it’s very compact: if you are flying there from Tokyo, you can get from the airport to the centre in less than 15 minutes, and most of Fukuoka’s key sights – such as Shofukuji, the oldest Zen shrine in Japan – are within easy walking distance.Make sure that you come with an empty stomach: Fukuoka is known for its food, from rich bowls of pork-broth hakata ramen to bright pink karashi mentaiko (pollock or cod roe in the shape of a sausage). Fukuoka Now is a website in four languages and a monthly magazine in both Japanese in English, which was founded by Canadian Nick Szasz and is packed with local news and upcoming events.If you do one thingRide the lift to the top of Fukuoka Tower (£5), which stands an imposing 234 metres high beside the sea. On a clear day, you get a snapshot of the real Fukuoka: Hakata Bay and the sea beyond dotted with small islands, the sandy shore, the mirror-like high-rise buildings and the hazy mountains marking the edge of the prefecture. Dusk is a great time to visit, so you catch the last of the sunset over Hakata Bay, before the city lights flick on to reveal one of Japan’s most amazing nightscapes. My favourite place to eat Despite Tokyo’s thousands of ramen shops, Fukuoka has a good claim to be the ramen capital of Japan. My favourite ramen bar is Hakata Isso, known for its rich tonkotsu ramen, served with soft chashu (pork belly slices) and a sticky soy egg. You’ll usually have to queue to get in, especially as it only seats around 10 people. As with most Japanese ramen shops, you select and pay for your food using the ticket machine on arrival (the words are written in Japanese characters, but ask which one is the standard tonkotsu ramen, £5), then hand your ticket to the server. Ramen is technically fast food, so don’t linger long after you’ve finished eating.• 3 Chome-1-6 HakataekihigashiWhere to stay Stand By Me is a “standing bar where you can also stay”. In Japan, standing bars or tachinomiya – tiny bars where the only option is to stand – took off in the 1980s as an inexpensive and quick place to grab a drink, and have become popular as fun places to hang out. Stand By Me has a standing bar downstairs and a hostel upstairs, with shared and private rooms that are simple, but clean and comfortable. A £7.50 ticket for the standing bar lets you pick any four things off the menu, including beer, sake and lots of delicious local food: it’s a good “sightseeing sampler” if you’re new to Japanese cuisine and aren’t sure where to eat. The bar is also a great space to meet other like-minded travellers. • dorm beds from £34, private rooms from £102What the guidebooks overlook Palm Beach The Gardens: even a lot of Fukuoka locals don’t know about this place. It’s a small dining and shopping complex on a golden beach, about 30km from the city centre. There are surfer-style cafes and bars serving Hawaiian favourites such as loco moco and garlic shrimp, as well as Italian gelatarias and cool surf shops. It’s one of my favourite places in Japan to watch the sunset, especially after a day of surfing.• 285 Nishi-ku Nishiura, Fukuoka-shi, FukuokaAfter a couple of days in Fukuoka, catch the bus or train to Dazaifu, nine miles south-east of the city. This seventh-century settlement was Kyushu’s administration centre for more than 500 years, from the year 663. The main tourist sight is Tenmangu Shrine, which was built in 903 on the grave of the scholar and politician Sugawara Michizane. The ornate red-and-gold shrine is large by Japanese standards – 250 metres wide – and set beside an enormous pond in the shape of the kanji character for “heart”.You approach along a cobbled street that is lined with vendors selling everything from wooden trinkets said to bring good luck to the umegae mochi unique to Dazaifu, rice balls filled with azuki bean paste and grilled with plum blossoms – a nod to the 6,000 or so plum trees that surround the shrine.Inspiration Follow: @fukuokadeeps on Instagram, an account showcasing the rare sites of the city, from forgotten statues to little-known temples.By Noriyuki Yamashita, shochu enthusiast and owner of Glocal Bar Vibes, @glocal_bar_vibesMy city in a nutshell Kumamoto city is built around the 17th-century Kumamoto Castle – considered one of the “top three castles” of Japan. In 1877, it successfully withstood a 20,000-strong samurai attack for nearly two months. In 2016, it faced another attack: a magnitude 7.3 earthquake. Although parts of the building were damaged, it stills stands on its grassy mount as a symbol of Kumamoto’s resilience. To the west lie the islands of Amakusa, and to the east, the volcanic mountains of Aso, making Kumamoto a great base for exploring Kyushu island’s wild side. But don’t rush to leave the city too quickly: after dark, the side streets around Shimotori and Kamitori (Kumamoto’s two main strips) come to life, packed with hundreds of tiny izakayas (bars) that deserve at least a few nights of your attention.If you do one thingSuizenji Jojuen is a 17th-century garden considered one of the most beautiful in Japan, full of arched stone bridges, plum trees and herons standing stoically at the water’s edge. It was designed in the kaiyu-shiki-teien style, leading visitors clockwise around a pond. The various elements of the garden are meant to reflect the 53 stops or post stations of the Tokaido – a road that connected Tokyo (then named Edo) with Kyoto. You’ll head across a replica of Tokyo’s Nihonbashi Bridge, pass a miniature Mount Fuji and finish at the Kokin Denju No Ma teahouse, transported to Suizenji in 1912 from Kyoto’s Imperial Palace. Stop for tea on the tatami mats (£4, including a sweet treat), watching the koi carp and turtles swim in the pond.My favourite place to eat Hero Umi izakaya specialises in seafood, getting its catch fresh each day from the Amakusa islands – the archipelago is just an hour away and is known for its high-quality hauls. At lunchtime, the fisherman’s bowl (ryoshi no makanai donburi, £7.50) is an assortment of sashimi caught that morning, served with rice and soup. In the evening, large sashimi platters come paired with a 120-minute nomihodai (all-you-can-drink) menu (from £30, call ahead to book). Don’t leave without ordering a side of basashi (raw horse meat) – a popular Kumamoto delicacy. • hero-umi Where to stayMaruko Hotel, a 120-year-old establishment just off the Kamitori, has the charm of an old-style ryokan but with the convenience of a sleek city centre hotel. You’ll find tatami rooms with roll-out futons, as well as western-style bedrooms. There are male and female hot-springs baths, a private bath you can reserve for your group, and a tiny outside tub so you can soak in the open air. Dinner is served in traditional ryokan style, with lots of colourful small plates of pickles, fish, tofu and endless bowls of rice.• doubles from £170 room only, set meals from £15What the guidebooks overlook My own shochu bar, Glocal Bar Vibes (a “local” bar for “global” people). As the bar owner I’m biased, but you can seriously feel Kumamoto. We sell over 120 different kinds of shochu – a distilled spirit made from barley, potato or rice. It’s the most popular alcoholic drink in southern Japan (not sakenihonshu, as most people think). On Tuesdays we do an all-English night – no Japanese speaking allowed. It’s a great chance to drink with the locals.• Arita BLD 3F, Chūō-kuHead to the southern city of Hitoyoshi – a 90-minute drive through 24 tunnels, or a 150-minute steam train along the Kuma River (£20 one-way). Even for Japanese tourists, this is about as inaka (rural) as it gets. The city is sometimes called Little Kyoto because of its red-lacquered shrine gates, Edo-style teahouses and hot-spring baths. But there’s also another reason to visit: shochu, the distinctively Japanese liquor made since the 16th century. There are 28 distilleries in the Hitoyoshi-Kuma valley, and the “Kuma shochu” name has World Trade Organisation protection. Distillery tours always end with a generous shochu tasting, so you may want to stay the night: I recommend Nabeya Honkan, beside the rushing Kuma River.Inspiration Follow: @kumalikecom on instagram (or visit their website: kumalike) for tips on the best restaurants, bars and attractions, as decided by the locals.Read: asianwanderlustenkumamoto-japan – a great blog giving you and in-depth account of the top things to do and places to stay in Kumamoto This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

If only the same could be said for the viewing publicSean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, shimmied his way on to Dancing with the Stars on Monday night in a shiny fluorescent green ruffled shirt and white trousers, brushing off criticism of his casting in the reality TV show by saying it was “finally time to enjoy myself”.In his attempt to dance the salsa to the Spice Girls hit Spice Up Your Life – highlights of which included some out-of-time clapping and a jubilant knee-slide finale – it was clear that the controversial former Trump aide was not holding back.Spicer’s inclusion has prompted criticism, with the show’s own host, Tom Bergeron, saying the competition is meant to offer “joyful respite from our exhausting political climate” free from “party affiliations”.But when the judges’ comments came, there were no bushes for Spicer, 47, to take cover in.Bruno Tonioli said Spicer looked like he was being “attacked by a swarm of wasps” on the bongos and that his hips “looked like they were set in cement”. But, he conceded, “I have to say it was strangely entertaining.”Carrie Ann Inaba said: “You were off beat most of the dance, but you had fun.” Len Goodman commended his “courage coming on this show”.Each judge gave him four points, leaving him with an overall score of 12 out of 30.But online, critics were not so kind:Many mocked his costume, suggesting it was the work of a Democrat.Some were already looking forward to the response of Melissa McCarthy, who has parodied Spicer on Saturday Night Live.At least he could take comfort in the kindness of former colleagues. The former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus posted a photo and the comment: “Fantastic time cheering on Sean Spicer live from #DWTS!”The former Republican governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee also tweeted his support, encouraging viewers to vote for Spicer.Huckabee’s tweet elicited a self-pitying response from Spicer, who appeared to take aim at the judges.“Clearly the judges aren’t going to be with me. Let’s send a message to #Hollywood that those of us who stand for #Christ won’t be discounted. May God bless you,” he tweeted.During Spicer’s tenure in the White House, he was criticized over a number of misleading statements, including the size of Trump’s inauguration crowd. He was also condemned for claiming that Hitler did not use chemical weapons against the German people.After he resigned in July 2017, he made a cameo at the Emmy awards and wrote a book called The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President, in which he referred to Trump as “unicorn riding a unicorn across a rainbow”.Spicer follows in the post-White House reality show footsteps of fellow Trump staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother after working for the president.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e135ee2f3678b50060b607f24e36e9baa4227a48/457_196_1106_664/master/1106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3041b5ee6c98096583f24248d5bfa2a5","title":"simple tips for blitzing your work to do list","story":"You don’t need to master mindfulness or download a complicated productivity app to stay on top of your adminEver get to that stage where you seem to be spending all your time and energy just putting things off? You know you should get stuff done but you find yourself weighed down by the tyranny of your to-do list.And, of course, the more you put something off, the larger the looming shadow it casts. This is particularly insidious when it comes to dull-but-essential tasks, such as admin.And if you’re running a small business, it can be even harder to discipline yourself, especially if you’re working on your own or from home. Moreover, the burden of business admin can feel particularly oppressive, sapping your ability to focus on growing your company.The internet is full of life hacks and tips to help you break this cycle of inertia. But all-too-often the suggestions feel like just another thing to add to your to-do list. Likewise, techniques for improving your time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming.Happily, however, there are a number of quick-and-easy tips that you can implement immediately – whether it’s advice for beating procrastination, resisting unhelpful impulses or countering your phobia of finances.For instance, when it comes to tackling the urge to check your social media, try thinking about how bad you’d feel in the near future having failed to complete the task at hand.Or if you’re trying to avoid procrastinating, tell someone else your intended goals for that particular day. This will make you feel more accountable – after all, it’s harder to break an intention that you’ve declared to others than it is to break a promise that you’ve made to yourself.There are also practical techniques for tackling some of the peskier admin tasks that tend to linger on people’s to-do lists – such as nailing your tax return, managing your web presence, and getting the correct kind of business insurance.1. Beat procrastinationProcrastinating doesn’t mean you’re workshy. It’s more likely to mean you’re just trying to stop yourself from feeling bad – either because you have to do something you’d rather not, or you’re worried you won’t be able to complete the task. So, try to focus on the positive outcome instead.2. Control your impulsesIn a world increasingly governed by instant gratification and the addictiveness of our smartphones, the ability to control our impulses is essential to getting things done. But try to think of this as a two-stage process: first, resist the temptation by making it harder to act on that initial urge – for instance by locking your phone in a drawer so you can’t check social media. And, second, maintain that resistance by consciously forming new positive habits.3. Overcome your financial phobiaAdmin avoidance can stem from a general anxiety about financial literacy. According to Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist and author, one way to combat this is to find yourself a financial mentor: “A great way to challenge your beliefs is to find someone who’s a step or two ahead, pick their brains, and become a student of their money mindset.”4. Tackle time managementOne simple trick is to try to become more aware of the value of each moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says podcaster and author Ellen Hendriksen. “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on, because that is time not doing other tasks.”5. Find your flowBeing “in the zone” or achieving a “flow state” can give us the focus and energy to perform at our best. One trick is to insulate yourself from tasks that might otherwise distract you by scheduling time in the week to do all the bits of admin that would otherwise intrude.6. Tooling yourself upThe popular idiom holds that a bad worker always blames their tools, but perhaps the opposite is also true: a good worker will always give them credit. Having the right kit helps you signal to yourself your intention to do a job well. In short, if we have good tools, we’re more likely to look forward to using them.7. Nail your tax returnAdopt so-called “microproductivity” methods by breaking this annual round of torture into a series of smaller tasks. These can then fit into those little moments of spare time we occasionally find ourselves with. For instance, try to view each figure that you need to obtain as a distinct task to be completed on its own.8. Manage your web presenceOne byproduct of ramping up your web presence is you can be inundated with demand that you can’t meet. “You turn your advertising off then,” says Jimmy McCann, head of digital strategy at Search Laboratory, which helps clients with online advertising. “It would also be worth having an overflow network to pass stuff on to and get a kickback.”9. Prepare a loan pitchSometimes a business needs a cash injection – whether it’s for upgrading equipment or premises, or just a bridging loan to help with a short-term cashflow problem. However, asking for money and demonstrating an ability to repay it can be stressful and time-consuming. Try to minimise the anxiety and avoid the possible pitfalls by being realistic about your projections – that way you can give a solid timeframe for repayments.10. Get insuredIt can be tempting to put off taking out business insurance. It can linger at the bottom of your to-do list because of the complacent attitude that “it won’t happen to us”. Part of the problem is that many people don’t appreciate the sheer number of possible hazards that exist in the workplace and their potential fallout – whether from accidental damage, disruption or injury. Often, it’s the anticipated complexity of sorting out cover, rather than the cost, that puts people off. But getting the right cover can be simpler than you’d think.For expanded advice on how to overcome common obstacles to getting things done, go to thewhats-stopping-you"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6e60efd3bde0befbcb8b0a95a42bf4c2624e017/57_296_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11b1b5df449ab3fcc72ad6c7439ce0f7","title":"israeli election close result expected as netanyahu seeks fifth term live news","story":"The Times of Israel is reporting a sombre atmosphere at the headquarters of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party – Jewish Power, in English.The paper says exit polls suggest the party, which opposes marriage between Jews and Arabs and with which Netanyahu entered a pact prior to the previous election, has not met the threshold. It quotes a prominent member, Benzi Gopstein, as saying:What is as clear as ever is that we were right all along when we said that without Otzma Yehudit there is no right wing government. Apparently, Bibi wants to make a leftist government with Gantz.According to Reuters, Netanyahu spent much of Tuesday engaged in a last-gasp pitch for votes via live video feeds on social media.At times, according to real-time viewership data at the bottom of the screen, fewer than 400 people were watching on a warm, sunny day when many Israelis were at the beach or shopping before the polls closed in the evening.Sticking to the same campaign playbook for the past week, Netanyahu repeated a relentless message to supporters of his right-wing Likud party as if his political life depended on it: “Get out and vote.”The alternative, he told them, claiming a strong turnout for left-leaning parties before any official statistics were in, would be a “disaster” – an end to his 10 consecutive years in power and a “leftist” government in charge.Political commentators dubbed it Netanyahu’s “oy gevalt” strategy, Yiddish slang for warnings of impending doom.Dressed in dark suit and tie, Netanyahu, 69, sat at a desk, a map of the Middle East in the background, and made his appeal in a rapid and imploring cadence worthy of fast-talking, “infomercial” pitchmen.As aides off-camera handed him cellular phones, he fielded calls from Likud activists across Israel, grasping the devices in one hand while holding up a prop – an oversized ballot emblazoned with his party’s name – in the other.“I am losing,” he told one supporter as a caption went up giving the man’s hometown as Nes Ziona, near Tel Aviv. Then it was onto the next call.“What’s happening in Rosh Ha’ayin?” Netanyahu asked, mentioning the town where his strongest challenger, former armed Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, lives. “Gantz’s neighbourhood voted at 7am,” Netanyahu, answering his own question, told the caller.Netanyahu’s battle for political survival looks set to continue for days or weeks, with the exit polls showing the race too close to call.The surveys by Israeli television stations showed Netanyahu’s Likud with 31-33 of the seats, compared with 32-34 for the centrist Blue and White. The exit polls indicated that Netanyahu’s ally-turned-rival, ex-defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, could be the kingmaker, with the backing of his far-right Yisrael Beitenu party critical to the formation of any ruling coalition.The ballot followed the inconclusive election in April, in which Netanyahu showed rare political weakness and failed to put together a government. Likud and Blue and White were tied at 35 seats in that election and would need to enlist support from smaller parties with a wide range of agendas for a coalition government.According to Channel 12 TV’s poll, Netanyahu’s Likud is on course to win 33 of the 120 parliamentary seats, with Blue and White likely to take 34.Israel’s election was too close to call, exit polls indicated, with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party virtually level with Benny Gantz’s centrist Blue and White. According to the Reuters news agency, the exit polls by three Israeli broadcasters had Gantz slightly ahead or tying with Netanyahu, likely meaning days or weeks of wrangling over which candidate might form the next coalition government. Jerusalem correspondent Oliver Holmes was earlier at the polling station where Netanyahu voted.Hannah, 36, a government employee who refused to give last name, said she chose Avigdor Lieberman, as a tactical vote “to defeat Bibi” – as Netanyahu is widely known. The secularist has largely abandoned Netanyahu, accusing him of allying with ultra-Orthodox parties and leading the country towards a religious state.“When I grew in Jerusalem, most neighbourhoods were secular. Now mostare religious,” she said. “We feel it every day in Jerusalem.” She said she was “more of a leftist” but was voting for the right-wing candidate to take down Netanyahu and make a stand against ultra-Orthodox power.Shay, 54, said: “I voted for Bibi. He’s not perfect.”Asked about the corruption allegations and if he believed them, he said: “Maybe a bit. I’ve voted for Likud for 30 years.”His wife, who asked for anonymity, said there may be some truth in theallegations but she was not concerned. She said she supports Netanyahu too, but voted for a political alliance of pro-settlement right-wing parties in the hopes of a coalitiongovernment firmly on the right.Gantz is a security hawk who who describes himself as a centrist but also supports annexing Palestinian land. He has promised he would employ “disproportionate force” to fight off frequent rocket attacks from Gaza. As with every Israeli election, security has been a key issue, with Netanyahu’s opponents attempting to paint him as indecisive and conflict-averse. When the prime minister was whisked away by his security team at a campaign event during a Palestinian militant rocket attack from Gaza, Netanyahu’s political foes jumped on the incident to portray him as weak.He focused his campaign on Netanyahu’s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves and outside his polling station on Tuesday, said his Blue and White party “will bring hope, we will be bring change, without corruption, without extremism”.Results are due shortly in Israel’s second election this year, following a campaign dominated by Benjamin Netanyahu and his vows to implement a far-right, ultranationalist agenda in exchange for a record fifth term as leader. His main rival is former army head Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party, who is neck and neck in polling with Netanyahu.More than 6.3 million people are eligible to vote at polling stations that will close at 10pm (8pm BST), after which exit polls will be reported.Facing the prospect of criminal corruption indictments and hoping to extend his unmatched stint in the prime minister’s office, Netanyahu has promised to declare up to a third of the occupied Palestinian territories as part of Israel if he is re-elected.His campaign has also demonised Israel’s large Arab minority as a fifth column that endangers the country, allied itself with the extremist Jewish Power faction, and warned that the election could be stolen by fraud in Arab areas.With a razor-thin margin expected between Netanyahu and Gantz, an inconclusive result where neither has a clear path to forming a coalition government is a potential outcome. That deadlock could plunge Israel into another political crisis, with the prospect of weeks of tense deal-making or even a third election.A third key figure is Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu’s former right-hand man, whose refusal to join a coalition government with Jewish ultra-Orthodox parties in May resulted in the second vote. His staunchly secular stance against religious politicians appears to have drawn support from the nonreligious right wing, and he could come out as the kingmaker who decides Israel’s next prime minister."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4021402.1568742115!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"archbishop shocked that food banks used by some schools","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArchbishop Diarmuid Martin:  Food banks are called by schools to help children who return after school holidays “visibly thinner”. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillFood banks are being regularly contacted by schools to help children who come back after the summer holidays visibly thinner and in need of nourishment, the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin has said.He said he was shocked to hear of this first-hand and added that it was a sign of how Irish education remains “marked by inequality”.Archbishop Martin made the comments during a Mass to mark the beginning of the new school year at St Patrick’s campus of DCU in Drumcondra on Tuesday evening.“Schools and students live within a fractured culture. Schools cannot do everything. However, schools are aware of the difficulties their children experience. “I was shocked to hear from our Crosscare Food Banks how they are regularly called by schools to help children who come back after school holidays visibly thinner and clearly in need of additional nourishment. “The school cannot do everything but the school is a vital part of the educational village and is very often the barometer of the physical and emotional needs and deficiencies of children and their challenges.”Community rootsIn relation to inequality in education, he said he regularly sees wonderful schools as well as those under-resourced and in poor condition. “The best schools are those really rooted in their community. I am especially concerned when I find schools in poorer communities with poor facilities. I am concerned about certain groups who experience educational disadvantage. “I think of the situation of children with autism. Their educational needs require an injection of new resources. Traveller children are still at a disadvantage.”He also paid tribute to young teachers whose first choice was to teach in the most deprived areas of the Dublin archdiocese. “They have understood what education in a fractured and an unequal culture is about,” he said.‘Fractured world’Archbishop Martin said the culture of education must be one that embraces and loves and offers an atmosphere of peace that is distinctive. “A fractured world requires a culture that integrates, which welcomes each inidual to find a critical path of peace and serenity and hope for himself or herself within all the ersity of our world,” he said.A Catholic school is not just an “archive of baptismal certificates and admission certs”, he said, but one which should reflect what the “wonderful reality of what Baptism means”. “Through Baptism, all are recognised as children of the one God, with the same opportunities and aspirations and hopes to realise the unique dignity that belongs to each of them,” he said.“That is what education is about and for a Catholic school to do less would be a betrayal of the work of the Spirit.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4018942.1568574872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools misusing special needs teachers say parents","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResource teachers and special needs assistants should be used only for supporting vulnerable pupils with additional needs. Photograph: iStockThe Department of Education is investigating more than 50 cases in which schools are alleged to be “misusing” special needs teachers by using them to teach mainstream classes.Under official rules, resource teachers and special needs assistants should be used only for supporting vulnerable pupils with additional needs.Parents and special needs campaigners, however, say they are aware of many cases where resource teachers assigned to help their children have ended up being used to plug gaps in the classroom.This, they say, is depriving vulnerable children of vital supports in the classroom.Adam Harris, chief executive of the autism support group AsIAm, said: “It’s concerning to see so many cases where it appears additional teaching time is being misused. These are only the cases documented by the department. We’re aware of many more allegations.”He said the issue was all the more concerning given the number of special needs children on reduced hours timetables or being suspended, often on the basis that schools lacked expertise to support these children.Some school teachers and principals, however, say that a combination of teacher shortages and underfunding means they are sometimes left with little other option.The department confirmed to The  that it has received 88 reports of “potentially inappropriate use of special education teaching resource” across both primary and secondary schools since September 2017. The majority of these reports arose from school inspections.It said it had written to all the schools – 71 primary, 17 secondary – to request they review their provision and confirm the school is utilising its allocation in accordance with guidelines, and provide copies of timetables.Of the 88 schools, it said 34 schools had confirmed they were now utilising their allocation in accordance with the guidelines.Of the 50-plus remaining cases, a further 29 schools had replied and their responses were being reviewed, while replies are awaited from 20 schools.The department said it was “continuing to engage” with five schools which had not yet been in a position to demonstrate compliance.“Further follow-up action may then take place with schools, including an inspection visit, if necessary,” the department said in a statement.Mainstream teachingSome of the initial inspection reports indicate that some schools have been using resource teachers for mainstream class teaching, or reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in mainstream classes.There have also been reports of using special needs staff to provide additional subjects for pupils who do not have special educational needs.A new model for allocating special education teachers to schools was introduced in September 2017.The department said, in advance of this, that a circular was sent to schools stating that schools should ensure that additional special needs teaching supports should be used “in their entirety” to support pupils identified with special educational needs, learning support needs, and additional literacy needs such as English as an additional language.SNA roleIt said the criteria under which special needs assistants (SNAs) were allocated to schools to provide for the additional care needs of children was also set down in a circular sent to all schools.This notes that SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context.“SNAs, therefore, do not have a teaching-pedagogical role and it would not be appropriate for pupils with special needs to be taught by an SNA,” it said in a statement.The department added that the Education Act (1998) outlined the primacy of the teacher in the education and personal development of students in schools.“Many children with significant special educational needs also receive additional teaching support from a special education teacher, who supports the classroom teacher.“When a pupil with significant and complex care needs has access to support from an SNA, the classroom teacher and the special education teacher will work closely with the SNA.“However, the class teacher continues to have primary responsibility for teaching and learning, and for the social and emotional development and progress of the pupil,” the department said.Mr Harris, meanwhile, called for increased inspections to ensure misuse of resources is spotted.He also said that plans to develop an alternative model of support to replace the current SNA scheme should be paused until there is confidence that the current system is being appropriately managed."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"More than 100

as ireland s coolest neighbourhood","story":"Dublin’s Stoneybatter has been named the coolest place in Ireland and among the top 50 most exciting neighbourhoods in the world by Time Out, which has just published its annual hit list of happening places.The magazine draws on both a survey of more than 27,000 people globally who were asked to name the best and most underrated neighbourhoods in their city and the knowledge of local Time Out editors and writers.Stoneybatter comes in at number 42 on the new list having leap-frogged its formerly cool neighbour Phibsborough which featured prominently on last year’s list.“There’s nothing new about Stoneybatter itself with its red-brick terraced houses and the regular clop of a horse and cart still heard on the road, this village-in-the-city has long been one of Dublin’s favourite districts,” says Time Out.This is something of an understatement given that the village was among the first places settled by the Vikings more than 1,000 years ago.The guide says that the past year has seen “a string of great new openings, from vegan cafes to hot new bars, challenging other neighbourhoods vying for the crown”.Over the last two years, two sushi bars and three vegan restaurants have opened in the village as well as several cafes, gift shops and pubs.The guide hails Stoneybatter for having “stood the test of time” and says it is “one of the most central places where young people can still afford to live (just), and the neighbourhood pride is strong - visit during the village festival and you’ll see what we mean”.The fairly recently opened Italian restaurant Grano is praised for its “top-notch Calabrian cuisine with pasta made right in front of your eyes”, while the also fairly recently re-opened Belfry pub is described as a place where “you’ll always find a crowd, most of whom spill out into the yard with a glass of the bar’s own barrel-aged cocktails”.Visitors are encouraged to check out the nearby Collins Barracks museum and advised to stay in the - also recently opened - Hendrick Smithfield hotel.When locals were asked to give their view of their neighbourhood, one is quoted as saying Stoneybatter is “the go-to spot for new eateries, and its local pubs and rock bars are the city’s hidden gems. Plus it’s not very touristy, which is nice”.In the international league table, Arroios in Lisbon was revealed as the world’s coolest neighbourhood followed by Shimokitazawa in Tokyo, Onikan in Lagos, Wedding in Berlin and Filipinotown in Los Angeles.Arroios is described as a “multicultural hub where street art meets food from around the world”.“With a legacy of countercultural cool and a whole lot of underground cred, Shimokitazawais known for its vintage and consignment shops, independent restaurants, cafés and bars, often frequented by Tokyo’s creative set,” the guide says.And when describing Onikan it says “creatives have been flocking to the historic district of Lagos in search of authentic surroundings, adding workspaces, galleries and bars to its eclectic mix of architecture.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4021263.1568735469!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney in informal talks over alternatives to brexit backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney speaking to media at Government Buildings: ‘Of course there are conversations, as you would expect, exploring concepts, what might work, what won’t work.’ Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has had informal discussions with British ministers about possible alternatives to the backstop, he said on Tuesday, but the EU is still awaiting formal proposals from the UK.“We await written proposals from the UK side. We simply haven’t seen any written proposals to date,” Mr Coveney said this afternoon. However, he also revealed that there are significant informal contacts on the shape of a possible new deal.“So of course there are conversations, as you would expect, exploring concepts, what might work, what won’t work,” he said.The Government insists that it will not negotiate with the British government on Brexit, as negotiations can only take place between the UK and the EU task force led by Michel Barnier.However, Mr Coveney’s remarks reveal an intensification of contacts between Dublin and London as the clock ticks down towards a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. Mr Coveney said that he had “an obligation to be both truthful and consistent” in his talks with British ministers.“If the current position from the UK side is that the backstop needs to be removed from the withdrawal agreement, well then it is perfectly reasonable request by us to say, well, that creates huge problems, how are you going to solve them?” he said.“Just because Boris Johnson says the backstop needs to go, doesn’t mean that everybody else will respond positively to that . . . There is an obligation on the party that is looking for change to come up with solutions that can deal with the consequences of what they’re asking for.“And if that question can’t be answered, we won’t have a deal,” he said.Border checksMr Coveney said the Government would not agree to a new deal that requires permanent checks at or near the Border. “We won’t sign up to any agreement that requires checks,” he said.In a no-deal situation, he said, there will be “checks somewhere” but contrary to what the Taoiseach suggested recently, Mr Coveney said “I don’t they’ll be near the Border actually”.Discussions are continuing with the European Commission, he said, about where and when checks would need to be implemented. He said some checks would be a “temporary and emergency response” to a no-deal Brexit.He said the Government would be “completely up front an honest” about the changes that Brexit would bring. However, he said that the Government would not reveal where checks would take place until “a few weeks” before the Brexit date.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves.

By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”The Welsh singer, whose other hits include “Holding Out for a Hero” and “Heartache”, will travel to the Vatican to perform at a Christmas concert for the Pope later this year.She told The Mirror: “I’ve been told the Pope wants me to sing \u0027Total Eclipse of the Heart\u0027 and I am more than happy to sing it for him.Yesterdays GMB guest was Irish singer Sinead O’Connor who, after performing “Nothing Compares 2U”, accused the song’s writer, Prince, of trying to punch her and “beating up” multiple women.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If I don’t earn the money, I won’t be investing.“If I’m not investing, that has a cumulative impact on jobs, on buying parts from suppliers, on the success of the company, on taxes we pay on everything.”Mr Flewitt also said he “hates the idea of a no-deal Brexit” due to the lack of clarity anyone can offer, describing it as “no deal with no understanding of the consequences of no deal”.He also said: “The politicians need to lead us. Fine, if the country has mandated that we leave, and that’s what we decide to do, but then their job is to make sure the rules, the guidelines, the processes are in place to manage that exit in an orderly way –\u0026nbspnot to damage, not to undermine the country because we didn’t manage it well.“If the outcome isn’t a great one that’s a consequence of the fact we had a referendum and we voted to leave.“But for the consequence to be a damaging one because we don’t manage it properly, that’s downright irresponsible – and it won’t just be supercars.“Your headlines won’t be ‘McLaren can’t build supercars’ on 4 November.“It’ll be: we can’t get medicines, we can’t get food, we can’t get clothes the chaos that could ensue – because there won’t be a differentiation between this component and that component coming in, cross-border trade – that’s the bit I think is irresponsible, to lead us into that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The company needed the additional funding from investors to complete work on the mine to extract polyhalite potash, a type of fertilizer, in North Yorkshire, as well as on a transportation tunnel to Teesside.The company originally expected to obtain loans guaranteed by Britain’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority. After postponing the bond sale last month, Sirius went back to the government asking for help with raising money from investors, but the government declined, the firm said.\u0026nbspIt added that it will now slow the development of the project – which includes boring a mine more than a mile deep – as it looks for alternative sources of funding.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

The promise has helped it win support from local residents in a region with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.The project is already a vital source of jobs in the area, directly employing 1,200 people.A government spokesman said: “We cannot comment on commercially sensitive matters. All requests for financial support must meet necessary lending criteria.

The 5 per cent share of short-changed workers is equivalent to about 1.5 million people.\u0026nbspA government report last year noted that there is effectively no state agency enforcing holiday pay regulations and cited evidence suggesting that the unpaid amount is equal to losses from violations of minimum wage rules.Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market – from maximum hours to minimum pay. But these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.“Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a pay slip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Europe celebrate winning the Solheim Cup at Gleneagles in Auchterarder, Scotland.

Workers must be paid the higher National Living Wage if they are 25 or over. The current rate is £8.21 per hour.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the risk of being short-changed on pay or holiday is closely linked to the worker’s personal characteristics, the type of their contract and their industry.For example, workers aged 25 and under are almost twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage as any other age group.\u0026nbspOne in seven workers in the hotels and restaurants sector say they receive no paid holiday entitlement, while one in six workers aged 65 or over report the same violation – more than any other age group.Workers in firms that employ fewer than 25 people are most likely to miss out on paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts.The scale of labour law breaches may be even bigger as the Resolution Foundation points out gaps in available data.\u0026nbspSurveys miss out some important questions and workers are often unaware their employer is breaking the law or they may be reluctant or too frightened to report the truth, the think tank says.Meanwhile, the HMRC findings on minimum wage underpayments are based on the number of firms that were caught and so also understate the true picture, the foundation added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rival taxi app Lyft, which floated in March, is about 40 per cent down.Beyond tech stocks, SmileDirectClub, which sells alternatives to orthodontic braces, managed to raise $1.35bn (£1bn) from investors before its shares plummeted 28 per cent in their first day’s trading last week.WeWork has been criticised in some quarters as an extreme example of hype over substance, having already racked up losses in excess of $3bn\u0026nbsp(£2.4bn) while spending freely on expansion. The firm leases offices on long-term contracts before renting them out on short-term contracts to companies and freelancers.That leaves it potentially vulnerable in a downturn when its customers seek to cut costs by ending their tenancy. Despite the simple business model, WeWork markets itself as a technology company that is changing the way people work and has attempted to value itself accordingly.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up a widely held view: “It would appear that WeWork has missed the boat when it comes to getting investors to buy into an idea that has yet to prove profitable.”With the company losing $2 for every $1 it makes, even a valuation as low as $15bn\u0026nbsp(£12bn) and $18bn (£14.4bn)\u0026nbsphasn’t been enough to whet investor appetite, particularly since a number of this year’s unicorns are now languishing below their IPO launch prices.“As Uber can attest, a popular business model doesn’t always translate into a realistic valuation and looking at WeWork’s numbers it is hard to make a case for the type of valuation being asked for now, let alone the one we saw at the beginning of the year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They helped researchers confirm what kind of object the mysterious rock was – and that it was unlike anything we had ever seen before.The images show the clear tail streaming out the back of the comet, which is what identifies it as such. The tail is the result of outgassing, caused by material being spewed out the back of the object and propelling it through the universe.It is the first time any visitor to our solar system has shown such a behaviour. The only other known interstellar tourist was the object known as \u0027Oumuamua, which did not show any tail – a fact that continues to perplex astronomers to this day.The picture was nearly missed, researchers said, but was the result of astronomers rushing to take the picture soon after the msterious object was identified.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build.

However, Libra differs from many cryptocurrencies as it is centralised in its nature against the founding member companies, in a similar way that fiat currencies are centralised against a central bank,” Ana\u0026nbspBencic, president of digital exchange\u0026nbspNexthash, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“Due to the ... circle of multi-billion dollar companies essentially managing their own currency, it is not surprising that central banks are cautious of money moving in this direction. It will be interesting to see the result of these talks and whether governments or Libra will make any adjustments to accommodate it within the online global economy.”The meeting in Basel, Switzerland, will involve representatives from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, according to officials who spoke with the\u0026nbspFinancial Times.Facebook previously said that it welcomes feedback from global regulators, claiming that it announced Libra long before its intended release date in order to address any potential issues.“In the nearly three months since the intent to launch the Libra project was announced, we have become the world’s most scrutinised fintech effort,” a spokesperson for Libra told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast week.“We welcome this scrutiny and have deliberately designed a long launch runway to have these conversations, educate stakeholders and incorporate their feedback in our design.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the past, Google has used its Pixel launch events to show off new smart speakers, Chromecasts, and other products.Google will almost certainly show off two versions of the new phone: the Pixel 4 and the bigger Pixel 4 XL, in line with recent years. It might also launch a special 5G version, it said.The company tends to hold its launch events in October, soon after the release of the iPhone, and so the rough schedule for the launch event had long been expected.

David Phelan has been testing the iPhone 11 for the\u0026nbsplast weekThree iPhones go on sale in a matter of days, promising improved photography, tweaked design, faster speed and something which may mean more than all of those to many: improved battery life.The new phones are the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max, replacing the iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max respectively.There’s a new naming system, then. Last year, it was the iPhone XS that was the standard iPhone, with the XR seen as a cut-price alternative. Now, the successor to the XR is the definitive iPhone, simply called iPhone 11, with the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max being presented as upscale versions. It’s a subtle repositioning.All of which is fine, if the iPhone itself earns its consideration as the mainstream phone.The iPhone 11 is a direct successor to the iPhone XR in design terms. From the front, it looks identical to last year’s models, with a 6.1-inch LCD screen that goes to the edges all the way around. This is a significant achievement in itself – most LCD screens require wide bezels at top and bottom at least. Apple found a way to reach the edges with what it calls a Liquid Retina display on last year’s iPhone XR and it’s the same here. The screen looks great, though at 326 pixels per inch, it’s much less detailed than the Pro models. Sometimes text can look a little less sharp than you’d like but Apple’s new software design, such as the gleaming wallpapers, for instance, emphasise the strengths of the LCD so well, so it’s rarely an issue.The newness in the design becomes apparent when you turn the iPhone 11 so you can see the sides. The XR was available in multiple colourful finishes and that’s the same here. This is visible from the edge because the aluminium antenna band which wraps around the phone is colour-matched to what’s on the rear of the phone.The colours this time are all new. Four of the six are gently updated from last year’s black, white, yellow and red, all of which are slightly different from the iPhone XR. The other two are completely new: a green that has a minty vibrancy and a striking purple. It’s nothing like purple, in my book, but is a mouth-wateringly appealing lavender shade that looks great. It’s the standout among this year’s colours, I’d say.The other changes to the design are on the back of the phone. First, the colours shine out brilliantly, with a polished-glass finish. Gloss all over apart from the camera bump which has a matte finish.How Apple’s new iPhones compare to the competitionThe camera bump had leaked in advance, or so we thought. But it turns out it’s very different from what was expected. The general belief was that it would be a deep, solid black bump with three flush cameras in, like the iPhone XS.In fact, the lenses protrude, so the bump is much less dominant than expected and the area around the lenses is coloured to match the rest of the back of the phone, not black as on earlier multi-camera phones. These two design choices make the camera area look significantly better.By the way, yes, multi-camera. Unlike the iPhone XR, with its single snapper, there are two lenses here – of which, more later. That’s the other big change to the look of the back of the phone, though there’s one more noticeable difference.On iPhones up until now, the back has always featured the Apple logo, the word iPhone and the words “Designed in California” and “Assembled in China”. In some “S” years, that letter would be there, too. There was also the CE mark and a do not recycle graphic.Theater at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, USA, 10 September 2019 (EPAJOHN G. MABANGLO)Apart from the Apple logo itself, everything else has now gone. The logo has moved down the back to a more central position. As a result, it looks much cleaner, more elegant.In the hand, the iPhone 11 feels great. Despite its large display, it’s comfortable even in smaller hands and the smooth edges mean you can roll it through your fingers satisfyingly.The detailing is remarkable, as you would expect from Apple. The volume buttons, power button, mute switch and even the inside of the Lightning charging socket are perfectly colour-matched to the rest of the phone.The cameras here are both 12MP sensors, one wide and one ultra-wide. The iPhone 11 is significantly cheaper, £270 less than the iPhone 11 Pro, with pricing starting at £729. Last year’s iPhone XR, by the way, is still available and has dropped in price to £699.Despite the price difference there is a lot the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro share and that includes the cameras. These are identical to two of the iPhone 11 Pro’s three cameras – the Pro also has a telephoto lens.Two lenses mean that portrait mode with its sharp-focus-subject-blurred-background effect is now here with a vengeance. It was possible on the iPhone XR through software but that meant objects and, more importantly, pets didn’t register. It needed a pair of human eyes to work. Now, portrait mode works for everything. There’s also a high-contrast black-and-white mode that’s especially eye-catching.A new camera interface means the phone shows you what the wide lens sees and around the edges to fill the display with what the ultra-wide would see, if you were using that. If you decide it’s a better shot, you can switch to it. It’s a useful system and my only disappointment is that when you do flick to the ultra-wide, it no longer occupies the whole screen. However, that wouldn’t show everything the camera can see, so it’s unavoidable.Edelson  AFP)JOSH EDELSONAFPGetty Images)There’s also a new night mode which activates automatically when light is low. You can turn it off, but the results are mostly outstanding, so it’s worth letting the iPhone do its stuff. It takes multiple shots and puts them together to create an improved result. The shots are taken over a second, sometimes longer and a slider counts it down for you.The images are realistic, not impossibly bright and still catch the feeling of the moment. On a couple of occasions I found the colours were a little different from what my eyes saw but this was the exceptional, not the commonplace, result.The camera interface is also improved with a swipe mechanic on the screen to reveal extra menu options.The front-facing camera is now 12MP, too and comes with a wider field of view. When you turn the iPhone to landscape orientation, the camera knows to automatically choose that wider view. Apple also announced the slofie (I know, I know) which stands for slow-motion selfie video shot at 120 frames per second. These are actually quite fun.All these features are on the Pro phones, too, but for many, the iPhone 11 camera will be more than good enough.This is a major upgrade on all the new iPhones. The iPhone XR already had the best battery life of any iPhone and this one adds an extra hour to that. It’s hard to pin down exactly how many hours that really means, but in my testing, it has lasted from early to late every single day. This is a super-refreshing change. I’d still recommend nightly charges for peace of mind, but this is a big step forward. Anyone nursing an iPhone 7, say, whose battery may be needing a little boost during the day, will enjoy what the iPhone 11 has to offer.The release of iOS 13 on Thursday 19 September brings more features. There’s the dark mode which has proved highly popular, offering a less in-your-face design with black backgrounds instead of white. On the Pro phones with their OLED screens that will offer power saving, but not with LCD. Here it’s a clean, attractive look.Face ID, the fast, reliable and secure facial recognition system introduced on the iPhone X, is more effective now and works at more angles, so you don’t have to crane your neck forward when it’s on your desk, say – though you do still have to lean in. This improvement will also happen on the other Face ID iPhone models as it’s software-based.iPhones on 10 September, 2019, and slashed prices of older models (Apple)The processor, called A13 Bionic, is blisteringly fast. Right now, it’s easy to notice how quickly apps launch and respond when in use but as developers create more demanding apps, expect the new processor to step up to the plate.Note that the splendid 3D Touch effect of the iPhone X and XS is not here. That’s the subtle haptic feedback you get when you touch certain menus. It was replaced on the iPhone XR by Haptic Touch which works in a different way. Previously, Haptic Touch was limited in what it did but it’s now been expanded to wherever 3D Touch went. Haptic Touch is now on the Pro iPhones, too. You can feel a difference and it doesn’t feel quite as nippy as 3D Touch, but on the whole, I forgot about the change pretty much instantaneously.The new design is a gentle update, but the new iPhone is still a triumph thanks to its snazzy colours, great feel and super-fast performance. Though the display isn’t a match for the Pro models it’s still fine and works well. The considerably extended battery life will be enough to justify an upgrade for many, and the extra upgrades such as the truly excellent cameras may seal the deal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mGiant salamanders, which typically live in rocky, mountainous river systems, were once widespread across central, southern and eastern China.Scientists concluded that Chinese giant salamanders erged into three distinct species between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago, which coincides with a period of mountain formation when the Tibetan plateau rose rapidly.But their meat is considered a delicacy in China and they have historically been used for medicinal purposes, which has created a vast farming industry. Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The company needed the additional funding from investors to complete work on the mine to extract polyhalite potash, a type of fertilizer, in North Yorkshire, as well as on a transportation tunnel to Teesside.The company originally expected to obtain loans guaranteed by Britain’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority. After postponing the bond sale last month, Sirius went back to the government asking for help with raising money from investors, but the government declined, the firm said.\u0026nbspIt added that it will now slow the development of the project – which includes boring a mine more than a mile deep – as it looks for alternative sources of funding.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

The 5 per cent share of short-changed workers is equivalent to about 1.5 million people.\u0026nbspA government report last year noted that there is effectively no state agency enforcing holiday pay regulations and cited evidence suggesting that the unpaid amount is equal to losses from violations of minimum wage rules.Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market – from maximum hours to minimum pay. But these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.“Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a pay slip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Europe celebrate winning the Solheim Cup at Gleneagles in Auchterarder, Scotland.

Workers must be paid the higher National Living Wage if they are 25 or over. The current rate is £8.21 per hour.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the risk of being short-changed on pay or holiday is closely linked to the worker’s personal characteristics, the type of their contract and their industry.For example, workers aged 25 and under are almost twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage as any other age group.\u0026nbspOne in seven workers in the hotels and restaurants sector say they receive no paid holiday entitlement, while one in six workers aged 65 or over report the same violation – more than any other age group.Workers in firms that employ fewer than 25 people are most likely to miss out on paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts.The scale of labour law breaches may be even bigger as the Resolution Foundation points out gaps in available data.\u0026nbspSurveys miss out some important questions and workers are often unaware their employer is breaking the law or they may be reluctant or too frightened to report the truth, the think tank says.Meanwhile, the HMRC findings on minimum wage underpayments are based on the number of firms that were caught and so also understate the true picture, the foundation added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rival taxi app Lyft, which floated in March, is about 40 per cent down.Beyond tech stocks, SmileDirectClub, which sells alternatives to orthodontic braces, managed to raise $1.35bn (£1bn) from investors before its shares plummeted 28 per cent in their first day’s trading last week.WeWork has been criticised in some quarters as an extreme example of hype over substance, having already racked up losses in excess of $3bn\u0026nbsp(£2.4bn) while spending freely on expansion. The firm leases offices on long-term contracts before renting them out on short-term contracts to companies and freelancers.That leaves it potentially vulnerable in a downturn when its customers seek to cut costs by ending their tenancy. Despite the simple business model, WeWork markets itself as a technology company that is changing the way people work and has attempted to value itself accordingly.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up a widely held view: “It would appear that WeWork has missed the boat when it comes to getting investors to buy into an idea that has yet to prove profitable.”With the company losing $2 for every $1 it makes, even a valuation as low as $15bn\u0026nbsp(£12bn) and $18bn (£14.4bn)\u0026nbsphasn’t been enough to whet investor appetite, particularly since a number of this year’s unicorns are now languishing below their IPO launch prices.“As Uber can attest, a popular business model doesn’t always translate into a realistic valuation and looking at WeWork’s numbers it is hard to make a case for the type of valuation being asked for now, let alone the one we saw at the beginning of the year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Is there somebody in the room who wants to live the Chinese way of life? Somebody in the room who wants to live the African way of life? Or the American way of life? he told a press conference at the European Parliament.I want to live the European way of life, with solidarity, with democracy, with protecting human rights - especially when it\u0027s about migrants. It\u0027s absolutely crystal clear.EU accused of adopting ‘fascist rhetoric’ with new immigration jobIncoming European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen came under pressure to drop the title, which she unveiled with her new cabinet earlier this month. She however\u0026nbspinstead defended it in an op-ed this weekend, warning that\u0026nbspadversaries of Europe were threatening these values of tolerance and nondiscrimination.Speaking in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Mr Weber added: I am proud to be a European, and frankly speaking I cannot understand why politicians are attacking a title to protect or defend the European way of life.I think it was a very important step from Ursula von der Leyen now to clarify with her tweet last week referring to Article 2 of the Lisbon treaty, and also with the op-ed she did over the weekend to clarify the content.Mr Weber\u0027s comments attracted strong criticism from other MEPs. Labour MEP Seb Dance said they were an absolute disgrace while Green MEP Alexandra Phillips said she was lost for words.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He seems to be the sticking point in negotiations with other partiesOther parties also refused to join citing Mr Netanyahu’s likely indictment on graft charges.This round, Mr Lieberman’s party is expected to nearly double their seats but has preliminarily promised to join forces with centrist Blue and White party, which is headed by Israel’s ex-army chief Benny Gantz, Mr Netanyahu’s chief rival.It could once again cost Mr Netanyahu his crown.The last polls published over the weekend showed Mr Netanyahu neck and neck with Mr Gantz, with both their parties securing around 32 seats.They also predicted, without Mr Lieberman neither Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing block nor Mr Gantz’s centre-left allies will be able to secure enough seats together to form a ruling government.And while the polls in Israel are notoriously wrong, in the last week a frenzied Mr Netanyahu has taken no chances.Feeling the heat, and that his career may be on the line, he stormed into the elections with all guns blazing.In seven days, he promised to annex all Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he is re-elected, he mulled a defence treaty with President Trump, he visited Russia to see President Putin and he even, according to Israeli media, very nearly launched a military operation in Gaza.Netanyahu isn’t bluffing about his plans to annex the Jordan ValleyHe also agreed to a slew of media interviews, and on elections day released a steady flow of videos and messages warning that the Arab voter turnout was soaring and that the Left would be sure to win.“We are in the closest fight ever with… Gantz,“ he warned on Twitter as the day was drawing to a close.“Only you will decide whether a strong right-wing government will be formed under my leadership or a weak left-wing government led by Lapid-Gantz with the Arab parties.”But even these tried and tested method failed to impress his usual support base.In Mea Shearim, an ultra-orthdox neighbourhood which usually votes for the religious parties but is also fiercely loyal to Mr Netanyahu, there was change in the air.Many agreed that while the Likud would likely win and there were few alternatives to Mr Netanyahu as prime minister, he was also losing support.It might be the end of Netanyahu, it feels like he might be holding the party back. He seems to be the sticking point in negotiations with other parties, said Daniel Katz, 33, a software developer voting for the ultraorthodox United Judaism Torah party.“The Likud has other people,” he added trailing off.Bibi\u0026nbspis not royalty, it’s time for a changeMichael, 60, who said he is voting for hard-right Jewish Power party, agreed. Jewish Power is also likely to form a coalition with Likud.“The right will win but who exactly that will be is still up in the air - this election is much more ambiguous,” he told The Independent.“Netanyahu is regarded differently now, because of this election. There is a great deal of apathy from people because the fundamental issues which prevented the formation of a government last time haven’t disappeared.In Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial capital, there was little love for Mr Netanyahu from leftist, centrist and Arab-Israeli voters, who were ided on whether the decline in his popularity would see their camp win.The radical Israeli town that reveals truth about Trump and Netanyahu“The most important thing is to switch out the king,” said Iftah Gorali, a Blue and White voter,\u0026nbspreferencing Mr Netanyahu’s nickname.\u0026nbspThe king is stuck in his place, we need to get rid of him, and our best chance is through Blue and White. I’m more realistic than optimistic. There\u0027s always a chance,” he added.In the Arab neighbourhood of Jaffa, Eliran Ben Iolo, 32, another Blue and White supporter, agreed:\u0026nbspIt feels like it’ll work, because Bibi’s already lost it. Now you see he’s throwing all kinds of punches, not smartly and not with any kind of understanding.”But David Horowitz, 64, who was voting for the leftist Democratic Union, said he feared a “third election”.Sami Haj, 21, who was undecided on who to vote for, was even less hopeful.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have Farage’s no-deal Brexiteers pulling one way.And those who want no Brexit at all pulling in the other direction.Neither are true democrats, because during the referendum the Leave camp promised to get a good deal from the EU, while Remain politicians said that they’d respect the result.And while those isive groups may shout the loudest, neither represent the majority of the British public who just want politicians to get on with it and work together to deliver a sensible Brexit.That’s why we’ve this week formed our cross-party MPs For A Deal group, to remind the public that there is still a majority of politicians who would prefer a deal-based Brexit to a catastrophic no-deal Brexit or an undemocratic no Brexit at all.Founding members include Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and Labour’s Caroline Flint.We all come from very dferent political backgrounds, and even on Brexit we’ve had our dferences. Some of us voted for Theresa May’s deal, not because it was perfect but because it delivered on the result of the referendum.Others couldn’t support it because they felt it was a ‘blind Brexit’ — a leap into the unknown — and asked May to come back with something better.But we are all agreed on one thing.After May held cross-party talks with Labour in May  she came back with ten changes to her deal, and we all believe that this compromise package was more likely to get through Parliament.We all believed at the time that MPs should have been able to debate and vote on this, but sadly it was rejected by second referendum advocates and no-dealers.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, as it’s known, included protection of workers’ rights, food standards and the environment, which would have benefited us all.We now hope that Boris Johnson brings a similar offer back to Parliament so we can vote on it.Sometimes it’s easy to forget that  Conservative MPs backed May’s deal in March this year while more than  other MPs voted for dferent forms of a Brexit in indicative votes.The desire to agree a Brexit deal is there.A failure to do so may well result in the consequences set out in the government’s own ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ no-deal report.Sensible MPs desperately need to face down the isive voices on either side and come together in the national interest.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task. But David Walliams’ golden buzzer went to Nico And Paddy, an -year-old salsa dancer whose signature move is the unravelling toilet roll drop, while the overall Wembley Arena winner was correctly judged to be Canadian escapologist Darcy Oake, who now faces the usual BGT challenge of doing something “even more dangerous” for the final.

Money does not cushion grief.I find it hard to imagine how anyone could read the excerpt of Cameron’s biography published at the weekend discussing the short le of his son and not be incredibly moved on the human level that should unite us all — regardless of politics. It brought tears to my eyes, although I had heard it all before from him and his we, as well as living through  years of similar traumatic experiences.His anguish at carrying his adored son in his arms for the last time was palpable.Perhaps I am just someone who shares some of Cameron’s “privileged pain” as the privately educated parent of a child with profound disability.Thankfully my daughter has survived complex epilepsy, among other problems, to reach adulthood.Yet like Cameron, I was plunged into the darkness of despair after the birth of a child with disabilities disrupted my le. Only later did I learn this was a form of grief as parents mourn the child they expected and come to terms with changed realities.We met soon after Ivan’s birth, a routine lunch between a journalist and MP turning into an intense discussion of shared experiences. Later we spoke about the impact on our lives and politics, even swapping notes on trusted doctors and schools.Cameron told me of struggling to take in diagnosis of Ivan’s Ohtahara syndrome, when a doctor said their son faced, “very serious dficulties”. He askedthis meant Ivan might have trouble with maths or much worse “I’m afraid it means he probably won’t walk or talk,” replied the paediatrician.For any family, rich or poor, this moment is a shock as dreams are shattered. Then comes a struggle to hold a family together, to retain jobs and relationships, to fight for education, respite and support in a system that seems often so uncaring.Your background makes little dference when filling in endless forms with the same details, searching for a school that might take your sick child, struggling with a seizure in a park, trying to find a public toilet to change a soiled pad or banging your head against blasé bureaucrats to win a few hours of respite care to retain sanity.Even at the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital we endured doctors who never read case notes, ed phone calls or responded to emails. One lost key files at a critical time another was a le-saver I will never forget.Exhausted families cling to such saviours as they navigate an overloaded, maze-like system filled with officials feuding over budgets. It seems almost asit is designed to inflame the distress of parents struggling under intense stress.This is recognised by this newspaper’s Give It Back campaign, demanding the Government plugs a £million-a-year funding gap and calling for a joined-up care system to help ensure families can live some semblance of normal le.Cameron wrote about the “torture” of seeing his son’s “small frame racked with spasms and what looked like searing pain” and feeling so helpless to stop the distress.However many times you see such seizures, the suffering never stops — as I felt again on Sunday afternoon watching my beautul daughter endure a series of fits that eventually needed emergency medication.As any parent knows all too well — hearing the hideously familiar screams while seeing the flailing limbs and rolling eyes — epilepsy can be a fatal condition.There are joys too, of course — but the pain of such parenthood is profound, the agonies seared deep in the soul, the struggles seem remorseless.And that is for everyone — whether rich or poor.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, some people get two. It’s like a lottery.If there’s a fire at the front of the house and that is blocked, the fire service said they’d have dficulty getting me out because I’m a big guy.“They made the house  per cent perfect but what they didn’t do was a door entry system and I’m doubly incontinent soI need to let someone in of a night I might not be in the best state.“I don’t want everyone having keys and having a key box frightens the le out of me because they’re not impenetrable. I have anxiety so I would never sleep again.Darren is trying to desperately lose weight and says he’s lost  pounds since taking medication to treat his diabetes after he was diagnosed last year.He says all he wants to do is to be able to enjoy his own back garden and not be a prisoner in his own home as he tries to get his social le back on track.“I’ve been anxious about this on top of my usual anxiety and depression,” he said.“Anywhere I’ve ever lived I’ve been able to get out into the yard and when you’re not very able it’s nice to get outside. I could even put a coat on in winter and go outside and sit with a cup of coffee while watching the birdsI wanted to.“I’ve been denied that privilege,you want to call it that, for the last two years.“As a disabled person I’ve lived for two years with this level of distress in this property and I wouldn’t have taken it had I known that this was the case.”He feels he’s being discriminated against because of his weight and admits that,he had another disability, he may be given a higher priority.His anxiety makes it dficult to leave the house but Darren, who is unemployed, says his depression isn’t being helped by not being able to get fresh air.A spokesperson from LHP said: Since being made aware of the customer’s concerns, the Lincolnshire Housing Partnershipteam, which was Shoreline Housing Partnership initially, has worked extensively to meet their needs, something that we would do for any inidual with specic housing requirements.Once a suitable property was identied, a process was followed to ensure the necessary work was identied and carried out – this involves recommendations from an Occupational Therapist, who is not employed by LHP, and the awarding of a North East Lincolnshire Disabilities Facilities Grant, .The work that was formally approved and funded by the DFG was kitchen and bathroom adaptation with the creation of a wet room, and the widening of the front door and internal doors.These adaptations were agreed with the customer. However, on their completion they issued a formal complaint, on the basis that two other actions had been verbally agreed but were not carried out – these being the installation of a specic door entry system and the widening of an external rear door.LHP decided to launch its own formal independent investigation to ensure that its course of action and action of staff were satisfactory, and this was carried out by a highly experienced independent assessor.A further independent fire safety assessment has also been carried out to address the customer’s concerns regarding fire safety in particular the rear access and again no further adaptions were identied as necessary.With regards to the door entry system: a system that is widely used by LHP was offered to the customer, but they deemed it not to be satisfactory for their specic needs. In such cases, LHP is happy for customers to make their own inidual arrangements.We value all our customer feedback, and aim to support all our customers, particularly those with disabilities, to ensure that they have a home that is suitable for their needs."},{"url":null,"title":"elon musk hired private investigator unsworth","story":"The Tesla tycoon paid James Howard , to probe the private le of Vernon Unsworth and claims he was later told he was wh**emongering young girls.The pair clashed when the Brit accused Musk of grandstanding by offering to help his ing team rescue  boys trapped in a cave in Thailand in July .Unsworth is now suing Musk in Los Angeles federal court, saying Musk ly branded him a paedophile and child rapist.

I don’t knowit is true.But whatwe have another Jeffrey Epstein on our hands  And whathe uses whatever celebrity he gains from this cave rescue to shield his bad deeds  This would be terrible.”In the deposition, Musk also said he now believes that the private investigator led him astray, and was “just taking us for a ride.”Musk also attempted to play down the use of the word paedo arguing the word just means creepy old man in his home country.After failing to have the lawsuit dismissed, lawyers acting on behalf of Musk have now argued the term paedo guy was not an accusation of being a paedophile.In documents, lawyers say paedo guy was a common insult used during Musks upbringing in South Africa and he thought it was synonymous with creepy old man and aimed at insulting ones appearance and demeanour.The legal documents add: There is no evidence that Mr Musk intended or believed that his July  tweets, that Mr Unsworth was sus or paedo guy, would be interpreted as fact.To the contrary, the evidence is that Mr Musk believed and intended his statements to be read as what they were: bare insults.Musk had sent additional tweets after the paedo guy post, including one saying he would bet someone a signed dollar the alleged accusation was true.His lawyers argue his tweet cannot be defamatory because the statement was not made with malice, a requirement of the US constitutions First Amendment.The row between Musk and Mr Unsworth began after the er dismissed his offer to help and said he could stick his submarine where it hurts on July  last year.Musk responded by accusing him of being a paedo. He later deleted the tweet.Mr Unsworth, , has a signicant other in Thailand, a -year-old woman, according to the lawsuit, which asks for , US dollars .He started going to Thailand in , where he explored and mapped caves, the documents said.In June, Mr Unsworth, a financial consultant, was made an MBE for his service to cave ing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its seen serious moments of high politics.Jo Swinson has laid out her pitch to be PM, the party has committed to cancelling Brexitunexpectedly wins a general election - and Chuka Umunna launced a ferocious attack on Jeremy Corbyn .But among the serious speeches some very Lib Dem things have been happening. Once famous for socks, sandals and vegetarian lasagne - Liberal Democrat conference stands out because attendees - and MPs - donapost seem to be taking themselves too seriously. And this year has been no dferent. So here are five ridiculous things that have happened at Lib Dem conference. Jo Swinson took her MPs for a walk on the beach - dressed in suits In a bid to highlight just how many MPs have joined the Lib Dems, Ms Swinson took them all for a walk on the beach. Which is totally fair enough. Youaposre in Bournemouth, and it is sunny, so get your trunks on and head for the sand right   Well sort of. Even though it was happening on a beach not a single one of them decided to dress the part.    We would have expected a sun hat, maybe a hankerchief tied over the head. Instead they looked like theyaposd walked straight out of the House of Commons - and it was a bit odd. An MEP who told delegates to vote against a motion voted for it himselfLib Dem MEP Chris Davies stood up on Saturday to oppose a motion - which was later overwhelmingly backed by conference - that proposed the Lib Dems would cancel Brexit by revoking Article  ,they won a general election.Mr Davies  warned that while the partyaposs Brexit position as a Remain party was helpful in earning support - that the motionaposs hardline message wouldnapost win over unsure voters. He said: Sixths months ago the European elections were not going to happen but today I stand here as part of the largest Lib Dem group ever to take our seats in the European Parliament. The problem with this motion is as a message it is not enough, it doesnapost reach out, it doesnapost give us the numbers, and it doesnapost reach out to the central ground.    Nothing in this motion helps us convince people whose minds are not completely closed. Despite the fiery invective, the Lib Dem MEP later voted for the motion. Two MPs who defected to the party sang a song mocking them for itTwo MPs who defected to the Liberal Democrats got into the spirit of their new party last night by joining a party sing-a-long relentlessly mocking them. Luciana Berger and Sarah Wollaston took to the stage at last nightaposs Glee Club to sing a song taking the mickey out of their defections - which saw them join the Lib Dems after leaving Labour and the Tories respectively, via Change UK.Glee Club is the partyaposs truly bizarre annual singalong. Every year on the last night of party conference, literally hundreds of activists gather to sing bawdy, often quite mean-spirited songs about politics. And they frequently take aim at the leading lights of their own party. For example, one notorious song, included in this yearaposs songbook for the fourth year running, mocks late-Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy over the alcoholism that led to his early death. Last year former leader Tim Farronaposs problem with gay sex was the target of their satire.    But last night the party decided to put their new MPs in their sights. The Mirror spoke to Ms Berger at the event who said she loved a sing-song. Every party loves a bit of singing, Iaposve decided to throw myself in here at the deep end and Iaposm enjoying it. Both Ms Berger and Dr Wolloston gamely sang the verses about themselves. The full lyrics of The Defectors Cometh are below. Mugs with Jo Swinsonaposs face on them sold out on the first day Meanwhile in the party shop activists and delegates absolutely launched themselves at the available merchandise. A hot seller were the mugs featuring the pictures of your favourite Lib Dem MPs. But so enthusiastic were the punters for their new leader that they sold out within the first  hours.    Her leadership rival - and now Treasury spokesman - Ed Davey was sold out by Sunday afternoon. Insiders inform us that an unexpected third place finish was for Bath MP Were Hobhouse. Edinburgh South MP, Christine Jardine, and Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP, Jamie Stone appeared to less popular with shoppers.

Claire Williams, , shed almost half her bodyweight after deciding to do something about her size when she lost all confidence. The newlywed, from Aberdare, South Wales, was embarrassed when she ballooned to almost  stone, partly due to her obsession with eating bread at every meal. But, after joining her local Slimming World group and taking up exercise, she found the confidence to walk down the aisle alongside her now-husband Matthew Williams. Speaking about her weigh loss journey, Claire, who married Matthew on September , said: When I was at my heaviest, I never would have had the confidence to walk down the aisle. But my weight loss has totally transformed me. Iaposm now far more energetic - and I couldnapost be happier.Claire said she had battled with her weight since her s and began to suffer with mobility problems, reports Wales Online .Any food I could find Iaposd put in my mouth, she admitted.    I would eat a stupid amount of bread. Iaposd have it with every meal of the day - breakfast, lunch and dinner. My confidence was at rock bottom. I was even put on a confidence building course by the Job Centre, but that just made things worse as it just highlighted all the flaws I had about myself. Claire said she met hubby Matthew for the first time in  and they instantly hit it off. He was running a taxi business, and he picked me up to take me to one of the Job Centre courses. He just flirted with me the whole journey, she joked. I was probably close to my biggest at that time. When we first got together I was embarrassed to walk around in public with him as heaposs quite a small guy. Whenever we had photos taken Iaposd ask for them to only be from the neck up. Despite admitting to being petried - and weighing just shy of st at the time - Claire plucked up the courage to join Slimming World in Cwmdare in . Before long she stuck religiously to their diet plan - which limits users to having certain amounts foods which are classed as syns.    It was a lot easier than I thought it would be, she said. I decided not to eat any of the syns at all, but instead treat myself to a few drinks on the weekend. It has become a way of le for me. Ahead of her wedding at Llechwen Hall Hotel, Nelson, on Saturday, September , Claireaposs weight had fallen to just under st. I got so close to my Slimming World consultant Lauren that I made her one of my bridesmaids. Sheaposs like my best friend now, she beamed. And Matthew has been unbelievably supportive.

She had initially thought she was feeling the effects of the night previous, which sheaposd spent drinking with university mates. But doctors in AE pumped her with antibiotics and found she had meningococcal meningitis.It’s so scary to think about even now but I dread to think what could have happenedI’d stayed in bed to sleep it off. At  years old I never thought I’d have to fight for my le, the marketing student at University of Portsmouth said.There I was at university trying to focus on my future but,I’d done things dferently, I might not have had one.    Speaking in Meningitis Awareness Week, Alice is encouraging other students ing to, or starting, university to be on the alert for flu-like symptoms which might instead be signs of the dreaded disease. She said: It can take hold so quickly I just want to warn other young people like me to be aware of meningitis and to take actionthey have any concerns. Early action could save their lives or prevent le-changing after-effects. Alice, originally of Kent, Orpington, went out with friends from her uni netball side in March. I got back at about am in the morning, not too late, and while I’d had a couple of drinks, I wasn’t drunk – I’m not a big drinker, she said. But I woke up the next morning with a headache and, although surprised, I wonderedit was a hangover. I had a really bad headache but though I tried to sleep it off, I couldn’t. I rang my mum early in the morning and said I didn’t feel well but was going to back to sleep for a while – I was conscious I had to meet up with my uni group later because there was a presentation I had to do by the end of the week.    But an hour later I was in agony. My headache had just got worse and I had flu-like symptoms. I called my mum again and said I felt really unwell, which was unusual for me because I’m normally fit and healthy, and I asked her to come and get me. By the time Aliceaposs mother finished the two-hour trip to the Hampshire town, the studentaposs symptoms had become worse. Her neck was stf, she had been sick and her eyes had become sensitive to light. She also suffered convulsions on the way to Princess Royal University Hospital in nearby Farnborough. Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord , NHS Direct says.It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults. Meningitis can be very seriousnot treated quickly. It can cause le-threatening blood poisoning  and result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves. A number of vaccinations are available that offer some protection against meningitis. Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include:a high temperatureof Cor above being sick a headache a blotchy rash that doesnapost fade when a glass is rolled over ita stf neck a dislike of bright lights drowsiness or unresponsiveness seizures  These symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear. Doctors diagnosed Alice quickly and she spent two weeks in hosital. She added: I was in so much pain and so unwell I was put into an induced coma and kept in ICU for three days. It was a really worrying time for my family who didn’t know whether I would survive, or whether I would come through it without brain damage, deafness, sight loss or limb loss – all of which can happen as a result of meningitis and septicaemia. Even when I came round, it was really frightening. When I was told what had gone on I got really upset at what might have happened. I had heard of meningitis because I’d had the MenACWY vaccination before I started university which can protect against some strains of meningitis . Alice managed to sit end of year exams but, five months on, she is only just getting back to her normal self and still gets tired.

The survivors, now aged  to  and eight of whom are blood related, are now celebrating their recoveries while raising awareness of the cancer. Joyce Waite, , was first diagnosed in  and her nephewaposs partner, Jane Reeson, became the last to have a successful mastectomy in . We’ve all fought cancer together as a family and shared our experiences with each other which has really helped, said Vanessa Haw, , who was the eighth family member to be diagnosed, back in April . The fact ten of us have gone through it has been a huge help. We’re a close family so we’ve been there for each other.    That support and knowing someone had breast cancer but survived has been brilliant. The shop owner, of Coningsby, Lincolnshire, who has four children and eight great-grandchildren, was diagnosed with cancer after an annual mammogram in April . She refused radiotherapy because of how it affected her mother Barbara who was diagnosed with cancer in . In May , Vanessa had a left-sided mastectomy and had all lymph nodes removed from her left arm. She had two more operations to remove damaged skin and underwent a right mastectomy in October  as a precaution.  The gran added: Even on the worst days, you knew there was le, there was hope. I had my last yearly mammogram in April . I got called back and had to have a deep core biopsy whilst I was there. I got diagnosed with breast cancer four days later. I made the decision to refuse radiotherapy due to the way I had seen it affect my mum. And her -year-old mum, Barbara Limb, was the second woman in the family to be diagnosed with cancer. The retired care home worker, who has five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, went to her GP in July  after experiencing breast pain. She was referred to Grantham Hospital in Lincolnshire and had a mammogram and two biopsies before being diagnosed with breast cancer.  She said: I was sat at my friend’s house when she said to me ‘Barbara you have got a pain’ and she asked me what the pain was like. When I told her she said it was the same sort of pain she had. She made me go to the GP that afternoon. The doctor saw me and got in touch with the local hospital and the next week they did a mammogram and a biopsy on the same day. The doctor said that there was something there but they bad missed it so I had tofor a second biopsy and the results confirmed I had breast cancer. I had my op on the August ,  and had lymph nodes removed and a lumpectomy. This was followed by a full course of radiotherapy which still burns me all these years later. But Iaposm a survivor.  Barbara’s niece Trudie Smart, , a teaching assistant from Boston, Lincolnshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in April . She had eight cycles of chemotherapy before having a mastectomy in November that year followed by three weeks of radiotherapy. She said: My breast cancer was ER+ which meant I produced too much estrogen so I opted to have my oies removed. Just months after her diagnosis, her mum Shirley Limb, , of Kirton, Lincolnshire, was diagnosed in September . Shirley, who has three grown-up children, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, was given the news following a routine mammogram. An ultra-sound and biopsy confirmed she had breast cancer and she had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed just before Christmas that year. She then had radiotherapy every day for three weeks and was told she was in remission in the summer of . Despite not being a blood-relative, Vanessa’s brother’s partner Lorraine Hill, , was diagnosed after finding a large lump in her breast in .  The barmaid and mum-of-one, from Horncastle, Lincolnshire, had chemotherapy to shrink the tumour before undergoing a partial mastectomy. Sister-in-law Hazel Holland, , was also struck down when she had mammogram in February . The mum-of-two and breakfast club supervisor had an operation in March that year to remove a lump and lymph nodes, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She said: I just took it all in my stride and got on with le.  Three years earlier in , Hazel’s mum Mary Limb, , was told she had breast cancer after doctors found a lump. She was in hospital for four days after her operation to remove the lump and lymph nodes followed by radiotherapy. Two years later Mary’s sister-in-law Margaret Bedford, , was diagnosed in August . The mum-of-three had a lumpectomy the next month and following four weeks of gruelling radiotherapy was declared cancer free. A month later, in October , her son David’s partner Jane Reeson, , was dealt a devastating blow when she was diagnosed with cancer.  The delivery driver and mum-of-two children had a mastectomy on her left side in November that year. She has been told to take estrogen-blocker Tamoxen for five years but so far all tests have come back clear. She said: “I couldn’t feel a lump at all, soit hadn’t been for the mammogram it could have been a dferent story. “Obviously knowing what many members of the family had gone through meant I was conscious of the importance of getting regular check-ups.” The family’s calendar will be officially launched next month with all proceeds going to the charity Breast Cancer Care.

The Met Office based its sobering predictions on an analysis that split the UK into a grid of .km squares, allowing it to project local events in a scenario of ongoing high carbon emissions. At present, we experience heatwaves – temperatures above C for more than two days – once every four years. But under the Met Office’s  scenario this rises to four times a year. And catastrophic flash floods are likely to double from once every  years to almost once every five years.    Met Office climate scientist Lizzie Kendon said: “Extreme weather events, such as higher maximum daily temperatures and intense rainfall events leading to flash flooding, are projected to be serious consequences of climate change affecting the UK in coming decades.“The new .km projections will allow us to look at the potential for local temperature extremes to exceed C.” The study comes after the UK had its highest ever daily temperature of .C on July , recorded in Cambridge.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young woman has made the agonising decision to have her leg amputated after a minor accident left her in constant pain. Helena Stone, , injured her leg in a kayaking accident six years ago. She suffered such agony she was unable to walk and even doing something as simple as a shower caused her to break down in pain. The Londoner made the brave decision to have the limb amputated after she developed complex regional pain syndromethat left her desperate for relief. The illness is dubbed suicide disease in some parts of the world where sufferers have no support network or modern medical care.Now after successful surgery, Helena hopes one day she can follow her dream and represent the country at the Paralympic Games, reports My London . Helena, from Islington, north London, suffered from CRPS for years after a relatively minor accident while kayaking in Wales when she was . She said: My foot got caught in the water and my leg got pulled. I knew it was bad enough that I went to AE, but I thought it was temporary. They sent me away on crutches and said I’d be fine in two weeks. The pain never went away. I’ve not become disabled by chopping the leg off, I’ve become enabled by it.    Spinal injections, ketamine infusions and regular intensive physiotherapy and psychotherapy followed for the next several years, but nothing could take the pain away. Helena said: It was like someone had tied a burning barbed wire round my leg and pulled it tight. It was so overwhelming.  I would always have a baseline level of pain, but anything could trigger it to become unbearable. It wasn’t just a simple knock or bash. Changes in air pressure could set it off. People didn’t want to sit next to me in case they brushed it. I couldn’t even have a shower without breaking down. In January, Helena got to the point where she got serious about wanting her leg amputated. The NHS does not give or advise amputation for CRPS as it could potentially make it worse, so she decided to have it done privately.    She said: You get to a point where you’re so desperate. You just think, how much worse can it get  It was worth taking that risk. I knew ultimately the leg wouldn’t be there to ulcerate and get bashed. It was also a mental health decision. I wouldn’t say I was suicidal but I had days or weeks where I just couldn’t be bothered. I’m one of the lucky ones. They call it the suicide disease in America. If people don’t have a support network, they crumble. Helena had her right leg amputated at Princess Grace Hospital Marylebone on September  and described waking up as like a dream. She said: It’s been amazing. It’s the dream scenario. I was telling the doctors the nerve pain was gone.    Any question they asked me, I kept saying the CRPS was gone. I was so overwhelmed, I couldn’t say anything . Her recovery has been going very well and she’s already able to get around using crutches. Helena will go to the prosthetic rehab centre to start relearning how to walk. She is hoping to become a Paralympian and will be mentored by gold medallist Andy Lewis, who won the Paratriathlon in Rio . She said: If I was given the opportunity to go for that Paralympics, I’m not going to say no. But most of all, I just can’t wait to start running and kayaking again. The accident hasn’t changed how I see kayaking. It’s a big part of my identity and I still love it.

But when her mother Angela Miah saw the footage, her iPad developed a fault as she attempted to press the aposlikeapos button - and an angry emoji face appeared instead under the video. Mrs Miah, an operations manageress, tried desperately to remove the angry emoji - but it is thought the icon froze and unexpectedly multiplied. Shabina then took the shower of angry emojis she received the wrong way and blocked her unwitting mother and refused to take her subsequent phone calls.    Mrs Miah went round to her daughteraposs home in an attempt to explain but left after the pair had an argument. Shabina was found dead in bed at her home in Macclesfield the following day after her mother went to check on her following a work appointment. Tests shown she had suffered congestive cardiac failure. An inquest heard former barmaid Shabina known as Shaz had a history of medical issues including depression and diabetes and had previously taken two overdoses of insulin. She got engaged to motorcycle technician Luke Tomlinson in November  and moved into a flat together but they split up in January this year amid claims she was unfaithful and she started seeing Dave Brown. Two days before her death on February , Mr Tomlinson moved back into the property although they slept in separate bedrooms.    Her mother told the Macclesfield hearing: aposaposIn the last three to four years Shabina had met Luke and he had a positive effect on her le. He was patient with her and looked after her but in January all seemed to change - her mental state more than anything she was out a lot and didn’t feel as close to me. aposaposShe was spending a lot of time with Dave and I thought something was going wrong and there was a problem with her relationship with Luke. I tried to talk to her about it but she wasn’t in a very good place and I pressed her to start taking her anti depressant medication again. aposaposDuring that last week of her le she started taking it again and got an appointment with a counsellor but she seemed very very confused and was in a very dark place very confused.

On the Saturday night she had gone out to see the band and the following day she went to the circus with Dave.  She continued: aposaposMy iPad was playing up and I saw she posted on Facebook a little video of part of the circus. I went to put a aposlikeapos on it but an angry face came up. I pressed it again and it wouldn’t go. There were s of angry faces and she had taken it the wrong way. aposaposShe blocked me and I tried to ring her and text her but wouldn’t answer. I was upset that she was upset with me. Because she wouldn’t answer I went round and we ended up having an argument and I was very distressed. aposaposI left and thought I would let her calm down and speak to her the next day. Next morning I arrived at work and knew Luke would be going to work and I rang him before he left the house to check on her. aposaposHe phoned me back and I thought she was okay. But I later tried to ring her a couple of times and then asked her sister who was in Australia to seeshe could contact her but I thought she was still not talking to me. aposaposI started to get worried and looked on social media to see is she had been active she hadn’t been. At the time I was doing an induction for a new member of staff at work and I called a break and said I had to check my daughteraposs alright. aposaposI let myself inside, shouted and then I just went straight upstairs into bedroom and realised something was really wrong. I was quite hysterical at the time and I knew that she had gone. The emergency man on the phone telling me to do CPR but I knew it was too late. Two weeks before all this happens Shabina’s mental state was really really bad.aposapos  Mr Tomlinson said in a statement: aposaposJust after new year  she started to deteriorate, acted strangely and confused and it was not like her. Started to hang around with another man called Dave Brown. She started to stay out all night and she and I split up in January - she was cheating on me. aposaposI still came round after work to see her and on February , I moved back - although me and Shabina had separate bedrooms and I didn’t really see her. On February , we went to the beach and that night she went out all night and didn’thome and didn’t see her till the next day. She said was going to the circus and I ed later that evening she was in the kitchen. aposaposI went to bed around .pm. Later Shabina had an argument with Angela and it was irate.

Claudia Ochoa Felix, known as aposEmperatriz de Los Antraxapos , is believed to have carried out multiple killings for the Sinaloa Cartel - claims which she always denied.

Felix was found dead in a house in Isla Musala in the city of Culiacan in the north-western Mexican state of Sinaloa. According to local media, the -year-old woman died of a suspected pulmonary aspiration, although it is currently unclear whether she was the victim of foul play.  Aspiration occurs when someone breathes foreign objects such as fluids into their lungs, which can cause choking and death. Reports said that she went to a nightclub in the city and ed to a manaposs house later that night. When the man tried to wake her up, she did not respond and he called the local authorities.    Her body has been taken to a forensic lab to undergo an autopsy. According to local media, the alleged assassin worked as a model and was romantically linked to Jose Rodrigo Arechiga, better known as aposEl Chino Antraxapos , who headed the Anthrax gang that is connected to the Sinaloa Cartel before his imprisonment. Reports also said that she was married to a drug trafficker with the Sinaloa Cartel nicknamed aposEl Chavo Felixapos, with whom she had three children.

Heading east towards City Square, to the right past Daniels brae, you pass the Burn Bar.“A quick look inside would probably see brothers Pat and Jim Sturrock pouring sumptuous pints of heavy, and Eddie Greenan would normally be standing at the far end of the bar.“A bit further on, you would be at the Blackness Road junction before heading down the Blackie past the Blue Mountains, and now entering the bustling shopping expanse of the West Port.“With the Globe Bar visible in a rear-view mirror, crossing over Tay Street reveals the Overgate. This historic artery had a pulse and an energy all to itself.“Those memorable stretches of the old town nurtured the players who turned out for Dundee Harp FC.”Rob revealed that Arbroath had a star defender, a local lad called Tom O’Kane.Rob went on: “He took no prisoners and could leather a ball from one end of the pitch to the other.“At the beginning of the - season, Tom was poached and somehow persuaded to leave his home team to sign for Dundee Harp.“The town of Arbroath was outraged at the smash-and-grab by Harp.“Were underhand means used to attract O’Kane “Probably.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.396679.jpg ","title":"blether exhibition on dundee uniteds greatest gaffer jim mclean is wonderful","story":"Tannadice Park currently hosts a wonderful initiative as Dundee United remembers the glory years under their greatest-ever manager.Tom Cairns, chairman of the Dundee United Business Club, along with several other volunteers, host the ‘The United in Memories’ display at the ground.Said Tom: “This year, it features The Jim McLean Years and can be viewed every Wednesday until late November .“On display is an array of interesting memorabilia encompassing the managerial career of the most successful manager in Dundee United’s history.“The event is staffed by knowledgeable volunteers from Dundee United Business Club.”This has got to be a must-see event for every United fan – and, indeed, every football fan.Admission is free via the main door at Tannadice Park from pm until .pm and has easy disabled persons access."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/6d95be58-2f14-4f36-b63f-63e31c6fe568-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/6d95be58-2f14-4f36-b63f-63e31c6fe568-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/6d95be58-2f14-4f36-b63f-63e31c6fe568-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/6d95be58-2f14-4f36-b63f-63e31c6fe568-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee 2 1 alloa dark blues get back to winning ways at dens","story":"Dundee cut the gap to the top of the Championship to four points after a hard-fought victory over Alloa Athletic at Dens Park.An early goal from top scorer Danny Johnson was cancelled out by Liam Dick#s scrambled equaliser before Jordan McGhee made it - at the break.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families. It is greatly appreciated.#He added: #Thanks to the town of Inveraray and everyone  who has supported us. We couldn#t have done it without you.#And it was on to a selection of brilliant tunes to entertain the adoring fans clustered around the green.Speaking after the event, Inveraray Community Council convenor Linda Divers said: #Thanks to everyone who came out to show their support to Inveraray and District Pipe Band, and to Councillor Donnie MacMillan for coming along tonight.#The community council would like to thank all helpers as well as the British Legion and the band for the use of their tents.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

The roof over this extension will be a green roof.ldquoThe proposal seeks to restore this category A listed building, rehabilitating it as a contemporary three-bedroom dwelling.ldquoOverall, the proposed architectural moves retain the external appearance and the local identity of the buildings and their surroundings while reconstructing existing dilapidated outbuildings.ldquoThe alterations respect the character, materials and scale of the existing fabric and enable it to meet st century standards for contemporary family living by replacing all windows and doors and including new internal wall linings throughout the lodge and outbuildings where materials and internal finishes have been carefully considered and selected to enhance its historical features."},{"url":null,"title":"council-bit-environment","story":"BORDERS Council officials hope to join a new environment consultation.On September th, Scottish Government revealed it wants the public sector to spearhead efforts to combat carbon emissions in Scotland.We asked the Scottish Border Council what its plans for meeting government standards were and how they planned to go about achieving them.A spokesperson for the council told us: \"It is proposed that a first action for the Sustainable Development Group would be to review the recent decisions and actions of the UK and Scottish Governments and UK local authorities with a view to making recommendations as to how the council can play lsquoour partrsquo in tackling climate change.\"We will review the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to achieve net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by  at the latest, consider how to respond to this objective, and, specically, any Scottish Borders targets and actions to which the Council should commit to.\"We have already carried out a number of positive projects including: installation of electric vehicle charge points and development of our electric vehicle fleet, delivering local home energy efficiency programmes supporting home insulation and launch of the Affordable Warmth and Energy Efficiency Strategy and local habitat enhancement projects.\"In  multiple city councils announced climate emergencies and were followed by UK governments soon after.Roseanna Cunningham, Climate Change Secretary for Scottish Government said: ldquoSeveral public bodies, including the City of Edinburgh Council, have already made firm commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected.

Donrsquot speak to that squirrel wersquove no time to talk.But of course we do live in a magic world, a world just as magical as any story world. Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

To date most of this work has focused on oceanic islands like Hawaii or the Canaries.However, oceanic islands are only present at the surface of the Earth for a few million years before they themselves subside and are subducted back into the mantle. So it can only provide a tiny snapshot of crustal recycling over the four billion years of Earth history.The St Andrews team investigated a suite of alkaline magmas erupted in continental rts similar to the modern day East African rt.The Scottish scientists say that although these magmas have very unusual chemistries, they show many similarities with those oceanic lavas and, crucially, are found throughout Earthrsquos geological record.The team focused on an alkaline province in south-west Greenland using cutting-edge isotope techniques to chemically fingerprint ancient crustal material in the source of these magmas.Through a combination of remote field work ndash by boat and helicopter ndash and careful chemical analysis the team was able to show that these magmas were tapping into ancient crust subducted into the mantle  million years before the volcanoes started erupting.Once the team understood these processes in Greenland they compiled a global data on alkaline magma chemistry and were surprised to find that the vast majority contained a recycled crustal component in their magma source.Lead author Dr Will Hutchison, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University, said: ldquoOur key result is that the isotopes of alkaline magmas are highly iable and this suggests that their recycled crustal sources have changed through geological time.ldquoThe beauty of our global dataset is that it extends back over two billion years and so these unique alkaline rocks represent an extremely powerful record for understanding crustal recycling over Earth history.ldquoBy carefully bringing together the igneous and sedimentary isotope records, this might allow us to understand how changing crustal input is tied to volcanic output, and ultimately build a much better understanding of what happens to tectonic plates once they get transported into the deep Earth.It is not the first time that Greenland has been picked to try and uncover some of the Earthrsquos mysteries. Some scientists have previously believed Greenland may have been home to a mud volcano where le on Earth may actually began.Researchers discovered the chemical elements crucial to the formation of le in mud volcanoes at Isua in south-west Greenland.It was believed le began in underwater geysers, but research conducted eight years ago argued that these could not have sustained le, and that the volcanoes offered the oldest environment where le could begin.The ices of Greenland and Antarctica bear the fingerprints of a monster - a gigantic volcanic eruption in  or  AD that killed tens of thousands and helped trigger one of the worst periods of global cooling in the last , years.And in August, it emerged, that after years of searching, a team of scientists had finally tracked down the source of the eruption.The teamrsquos work laid out evidence that ties the natural disaster to Ilopango, a now-dormant volcano in El Salvador. Researchers estimated that in its sixth-century eruption, Ilopango expelled the equivalent of . cubic miles of dense rock, making it one of the biggest volcanic events on Earth in the last , years. The blast was more than a hundred times bigger than the  Mount St. Helens eruption."},{"url":null,"title":"marie-claire-39-s-easy-sneer-women-39-s-magazines---39-ll-miss","story":"Opening the glossy, handbag sized covers marked a transition from girlhood to womanhood. Prior to that, Irsquod been a regular reader of Mandy and Judy but now, now I was fully adult.From then, I never missed an issue.What lured me in, I think, was the unfettered aspiration of it all. As young women can be prone to, I was never satisfied with myself and here was, essentially, a manual of betterment.The women featured - the models, the celebrities - had perfect skin, swishy hair and fashionable clothing.If I could only add up all the money I spent on skincare having read the promises of epidermal glory, Id likely have enough to pay off my mortgage.Marie Claire came as an addition to Glamour. I liked its serious features, sitting side by side with fashion and beauty. I credit Marie Claire with introducing me to the hardships of women in developing countries, broadening my feminism and introducing me to international news.Thats right, a womans glossy. Who would have thought But womens magazines have long, long been a Trojan horse, sneaking controversial topics in among the lighter articles - whether thats through the agony aunt pages or simply a strong editorial decision.You wouldnt think it because its so easy to sneer at womens magazines - heavy on the advertising, heavier on the fluff. Melt your back fat, how to wear neon yellow eye shadow, buy these shoes at pound a pop. And its so easy to sneer at things aimed at women, to fail to take womens likes and choices seriously.Readers could learn about miscarriage and also about how to make shorts appropriate office wear, learn about hemlines and headlines.They helped to define mainstream feminism and, in the popularity contest of publicity, often went awry - Glamour, say, giving its annual Women of the Year Award tohellip Bono. A man, and not a very popular man at the best of times.The magazine was also an early adopter of the currents trans rights debate, sparky controversy when giving the newly transitioned Caitlyn Jenner the same award.Some of the most read political coverage has come from womens mags: from Teen Voguersquos op-ed on Donald Trump gas lighting America to Michael Howard being grilled on his views on abortion by Cosmopolitan magazine during the  election.When broadsheet newspapers treated ldquowomenrsquos issues as a separate, less worthy topic to be handled by one dedicated page and tabloid papers dealt with women exclusively as sex objects, womenrsquos magazines gave a voice and a place for the things that mattered to women.In an industry where female editors were a minority, magazines allowed women to reach the top. Female writers with serious clout have contributed to womens magazines: Joan Didion at Vogue Glamour had Susan Orlean and Gloria Steinem while Betty Friedan used a commission for Good Housekeeping to rip apart the medium.I cant pinpoint the moment that I stopped reading womens magazines. Partly I simply didnt have the time - there was no natural point in my day for me to pause with a magazine. Mostly I simply no longer needed the services of Glamour or Marie Claire.It slowly dawned on me over a long awakening that the pound skin cream wasnt making any discernible dferent to anything other than my bank account. I would never buy any of the clothes in any of the features because they were out of my price range.By now my current affairs came from newspapers instead.Its not the case that magazines failed to move with the times. They very much did, backing the trend towards body positivity rather than thinness at any cost introducing more politics and current affairs becoming more erse in the models they used.Magazines, though, are always aspirational, no matter how down to earth or wholesome they try to appear. Even when serious subjects were tackled in one section, there was also still the subtle message pervading the rest of the pages that you could and should be more beautul, more fashionable and buy more stuff.Buying a magazine became a bit of an event - something for a flight or a long train journey. Something to switch off with.And so it came to the point with Glamour I didnrsquot notice that, in , it had gone web-only. If there was anything I did need, I would Google it. You would think somebody working in an industry dependent on print sales would be more mindful of paying for a product, but no.I wasnt alone in giving up my monthly glossies. Marie Claire has recently too joined the ranks of the digital first, that publishing half le of having no print edition.The internet has everything the mags offered: online magazines cover feminism, beauty vloggers deal with lipstick and food websites cover cookery.What the web lacks is scrutiny. Magazines had teams of fact checkers. Editors had accountability - think of the backlash against skinny models that saw the glossies called to explain themselves to politicians.Theres no road back now for the web only publications but lets hope we dont regret what comes to fill their place."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-pride-flag-proms-big-moment-inclusivity","story":"Lucky because that yearrsquos programme included Chocircros No.  by Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the combined choral forces of the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Chorus. The sound they created was huge, uplting and utterly enveloping, and experiencing it was by far the highlight not just of that night but of any orchestral performance I had seen before or since. Even now, a decade later, I get goosebumps just thinking about it.The second half, though, I think my dad and I could both have taken or left. All that pomp and circumstance didnrsquot really sit too easy with us and I am pretty sure we were the only ones in the audience not to stand and holler during the highly theatrical rendition of the Thomas Arne staple, Rule, Britannia. It wasnrsquot just that lyrics about Britons flourishing ldquogreat and free at the expense of nations ldquonot so blest as thee grated, but that all the flag-waving and singing along felt more than a little bit daft. The whole thing just wasnrsquot very us.But thatrsquos the thing about The Proms: despite many of its concerts pushing musical boundaries despite a programme of free discussion events shedding light on the seeming impenetrability of classical music and despite the availability of thousands of pound promming tickets meaning those of slender means still have some hope of managing to attend, for too many people The Proms is the last night, the last night is the second half and the second half just isnrsquot for them. Given that itrsquos all so very British Empire, with all the negative connotations that that brings, can you blame them Only this year the final event of the eight-week extravaganza was a little bit dferent. Yes, there was the usual patriotic fare, with Henry Woodrsquos Fantasia on British Sea-Songs, Edward Elgarrsquos Land of Hope and Glory, Hubert Parryrsquos Jerusalem and ndash of course ndash Rule, Britannia all featuring. And, yes, there was plenty of union flaggery. But this year there was something  too: a self-styled ldquoqueer girl with a nose ring using an event that to some symbolises the pinnacle of cultural exclusivity to take a very public stand in the name of inclusivity.American mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton has seemingly never been one to conform, with her love of opera representing ldquoan act of musical rebellion against parents who raised her to the sounds of bluegrass, the Grateful Dead and The Beatles. Having come out as bisexual in , she used her appearance at this yearrsquos Proms finale to stage another act of rebellion, subverting the chauvinistic undertones and overtones of Rule, Britannia by performing it in the colours of the bisexual flag while waving the distinctive rainbow Pride flag high above her head.It was a gesture, she said, that was designed to ldquomake a very clear statement of pride, tweeting afterwards that ldquoit was an honour to wave a flag that stands for inclusivity, ersity, and above all, love.Her actions certainly had a positive effect for some, with the Proms audience in the Albert Hall breaking into spontaneous applause when Ms Barton held her flag aloft and the journalist James Ball, global editor at The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, tweeting that Ms Bartonrsquos actions represented ldquoa moment for inclusivity. A colleague of mine said witnessing that moment was ldquowonderful, adding that ldquoas a gay man, it brought tears to my eyes.Not everyone felt that way, though. Jordan Daly, co-founder of LGBT visibility charity Time for Inclusive Education, spoke for many when he tweeted thatMs Barton waving the Pride flag during Rule, Britannia was a moment it was ldquoa crass one. ldquoA rainbow flag during Rule Britannia \" he wrote. ldquoThere are LGBT people suffering the worst violence and discrimination across parts of the Commonwealth because of the cultural impact of the British Empirersquos exported homophobia and sodomy laws. Save this.I can certainly see his point. After all, wasnrsquot it the glorication of empire ndash of the ldquodread and envy Britons could instil in others ndash that kept my dad and me in our seats back in   And there is no doubt that colonial-era laws are still blighting the lives of LGBT people the world over, with India only last year overturning British-born legislation that banned consensual gay sex on the basis it was an ldquounnatural act, while it is estimated that close to  former British-administered countries continue to criminalise homosexuality. It is a shameful legacy of a shameful time in our collective history that not one of us can be proud of.Yet to dismiss the waving of a Pride flag during that particular song, in that particular segment of that particular event, would seem to miss the signicance of the moment entirely.In modern times at least the finale of The Last Night of the Proms has always been something of a camp affair. The Rule, Britannia my dad and I saw back in  was no exception, with mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly, a singer famed for playing so-called breeches roles, strutting onto the Albert Hall stage dressed as Lord Nelson, saluting and scowling like the best of pantomime villains. Yet despite that it has never seemed a particularly inclusive affair ndash until now.Of course itrsquos right to question whether operatic pieces like Rule, Britannia, whose words most certainly leave plenty to be desired, have a place on modern concert programmes. And of course the idea of revelling in an age-old image of Britishness at this particular moment in history will be repugnant to many. But anything that shows that traditions like the Last Night of the Proms are not the preserve of traditionalists, that meanings can be changed and that membership \"rules\" can be relaxed, has got to be recognised for what it is ndash a moment. More than anything, though, Jamie Bartonrsquos moment was A Moment not in spite of its setting, but because of it.

As Nick Clegg could remind him, campaign promises can come back to bite political parties. Sir Nick \"promised\" not to increase university tuition fees. He did. Better Together \"promised\" that voting No would secure Scotlandrsquos place in Europe. It didnrsquot. The SNPrsquos promise in its  Holyrood manesto was conditional: the Scottish Government should have the right to hold a democratic event \" there is a signicant and material change in the circumstanceshellip such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\". Dragging Scotland out of the EU defies the  percent who voted to remain. No democrat should deny Holyrood the means of honouring such a clear vote.: A pro-independence majority at Holyrood is not a mandate for another referendumSimply setting aside the EU referendum result might be the LibDems latest style but Mr Rennie would do better to observe the Edinburgh Agreementrsquos aspirations for the referendum. Its terms sought a process that \"should deliver a fair test and a decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect\". The  loss of the referendum was followed by an unprecedented SNP landslide in  SNP majority of seats in  and  an overwhelming SNP majority in rsquos EU election. These indicators, plus opinion poll increases in support for both independence and a second ballot, suggest that the people of Scotland ndash to whom politicians are accountable ndash appear increasingly minded not to respect the result from . If the single expectation was that the result would command respect there was no indication that that respect would be mandatory. The \"settled will\" of . percent in Scotland who voted to reconvene the Scottish Parliament has been respected the No vote settled nothing.Before Mr Rennie boxes himself into a \"no deal\" position he should reflect on Scottish historical intellectual flexibility. Hugh MacDiarmid observed that the \"constant effort\" of Patrick Geddes was \"to help people to think for themselves, and to think round the whole circle, not in scraps and bits\". Scotlandrsquos independent future maps onto that \"whole circle\" of which collaborative, broad and cross-community consensus will form part. As MacDiarmid observed of Geddes \"he knew that watertight compartments are useful only to a sinking ship\".

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We have seen consistent growth, and demand for Scottish products like machinery, food and drink continue to rise across the globe.However, the ongoing uncertainty of a looming no-deal Brexit poses a huge threat to jobs, businesses and our economy and I fear these impacts are becoming more pronounced.The publication last week of the UK Government’s assessment of the likely impact of and preparedness for a no-deal Brexit sets out the stark and grim reality of the dangers we are facing.Under no-deal, according to the UK Government, delays to freight would mean delays to goods in and out of the UK, causing issues for importers and exporters as well as manufacturers. Fresh food supply will decrease and financial services – one of Scotland’s largest industries – will be disrupted. There may be fuel disruption and impacts at Scotland’s only refinery at Grangemouth. All of which points to a major dislocation for our economy.That’s the base or worst-case no-deal situation – and it’s a situation which, at this point in the Brexit negotiations, puts our economy in jeopardy.It is hardly a surprise that, faced with these prospects, overseas orders are falling as companies in other countries aren’t willing to take the risk to buy products or invest in services that they don’t know they will receive.: Path open for independent Scotland to ‘walk into’ EU membershipFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThe economic implications of leaving the EU with no-deal will be disastrous for Scotland and could push the country into recession. The Fraser of Allander Institute has said no-deal could equate to GDP in Scotland being £ billion lower and unemployment rising to nearly double the current rate. That level of contraction would more than wipe out the last two years’ growth in the economy and the gains in employment.But it’s not just no-deal, even an orderly Brexit will have an impact. The European single market and customs union is particularly vital to the Scottish economy and is eight times bigger than the UK market alone. More than half of all Scottish goods we exported in the last three months were sent to Europe and over the past year, goods exports to Europe have increased by . per cent to £. billion.And a Brexit that saw Northern Ireland able to benefit from continued alignment or membership with the single market or customs union while Scotland is dragged further away would put us at a real competitive disadvantage.: Boris Johnson ‘working flat out’ on Brexit deal as he meets Juncker: Brexit: Boris Johnson lied about his alleged lie to the Queen – Brian WilsonWe are already seeing the impact Brexit and the threat of no deal is having on business and consumer confidence in Scotland with an increase in stockpiling and reduced investment intentions.Consumer sentiment in Scotland has been negative since the EU referendum and we’ve seen it deteriorate further in the first half of the year.Last week our unemployment figures, whilst low, began to rise suggesting a slow-down in the labour market.Every day brings new warning bells.The UK Government cannot simply claim this isn’t happening, when every independent study highlights the risk Brexit poses and the damage being done. Temporary boosts in activity as people and businesses stockpile ahead of approaching deadlines are beneficial on the surface, but they speak to the dangerous situation we are in.Figures showing negative growth in the UK in the last quarter should not simply be discounted as a blip.Now I am an optimist and a believer that Scotland and Scotland’s business community are incredibly resilient. The recovery from the financial crash shows what can be done and the progress in industries such as renewable energy, food-and-drink and tourism shows that we can tap into new markets, that our expertise is valued, and our exports valuable.Through our work as a Government, we are taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from Brexit at the same time as we continue to work to make our economy fit for a low-carbon, high-innovation future.Our Future Skills Action Plan will help ensure Scotland has a skilled and productive workforce which is resilient to future economic challenges.We are continuing to increase investment in RD, our export plan seeks to ensure we are not just fighting back against the impact of Brexit but targeting key markets and key industries that have real growth potential.We will build on that in the next year with an action plan to boost inward investment and the early stage investments of the Scottish National Investment Bank.We aim to combat the potential fall in population as a result of Brexit, with campaigns to ensure EU citizens know Scotland is their home and they are welcome and efforts to secure an immigration policy that fits Scotland’s needs.And we are engaging with business organisations across Scotland and seeking to address their concerns to mitigate any drop in economic activity and to remove constraints to trade. This includes providing bespoke information for how businesses can prepare for Brexit and supporting access to finance, for businesses of all sizes.We will continue to do all of that and more, against the backdrop of this deeply damaging Brexit, but I must be honest that not every impact of Brexit can be mitigated.Of course, the easiest way to tackle this is to prevent Brexit and we will keep working to do that. The economic damage already being done shows why standing up to this UK Government is so important.Scotland did not vote to leave the EU and we continue to stand firm against efforts to take us out of the EU against our will.Derek Mackay is Finance Secretary and SNP MSP for Renfrewshire North and West©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dark skies and economic progress are both important leader comment","story":"For centuries, light has been associated with economic and philosophical progress.And so it might seem a bit odd, in the home of the Scottish Englightenment, to be extolling the virtues of darkness.But modern science has demonstrated the importance of both light and dark to the human body clock as well as the rhythms of the natural world.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"casements claim replay win over johnnies","story":"Northern Switchgear Antrim Senior Football Championship quarter-final replayPortglenone Casements -St John’s -From Paddy Tierney at Coláiste FeirsteTHE sequels are never as good as the originals and last night’s Antrim SFC replay failed to reach the heights of Sunday’s thriller in Ahoghill as St John’s crashed out of the Championship following a three-point defeat Portglenone at Coláiste Feirste. In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem. Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that.

Gingham tablecloth, matching curtains, egg and chips on the hob and Tara Lynne O’Neill’s Shirley Valentine invites us into her kitchen.Willy Russell’s iconic play, later a film, has been relocated from s Liverpool to Belfast in this winning new production by Patrick J O’Reilly – the artistic director of Tinderbox Theatre Company.Shirley keeps telling us that she is “ years old”, which doesn’t seem that old at all but the character, at this stage in her le, is already done. She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

Adams and Martin McGuinness were both on the republican team whose chief demand was for a British commitment to withdraw from Northern Ireland.The talks collapsed and shortly afterwards sectarian tensions in Belfast boiled over as Catholics fled their homes but were stopped from occupying vacated Protestant houses in the west of Belfast.“That was the end of the ceasefire,” says former IRA man Tommy Gorman.The Provisionals resumed their offensive and on Bloody Friday nine people were killed and  injured as the IRA unleashed  bombs across Belfast.Brendan DuddyLord Ramsbotham, who was aide to the Army’s most senior officer here, told the Spotlight documentary that Bloody Friday provided an “admirable excuse” for the start of Operation Motorman to get rid of the no-go areas.Some , soldiers were deployed in what was the biggest military operation of the Troubles.The Army met little or no resistance and MacIntyre says that was because of the late Derry businessman Brendan Duddy, who had contacts within the IRA and the RUC.Duddy was at the centre of a secret agreement to reduce the possibility of bloodshed by removing more than  Provisional weapons from the city.Duddy — who died in May  — was to become a vital conduit between the British and the IRA in their discussions for the rest of the Troubles."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38488318.ece/4b683/BINARY/poll.jpg","title":"poll 51 of northern ireland voters back united ireland according to lord","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

The door is now wide open for an independent higher education institution for the North West.It provides us with a once-in-a-letime opportunity for the city-region, as long as we are prepared to grasp it. It is now almost  years since the campaign for a Derry university first began.Specically, the report raises a number of questions, which must be answeredwe are to redress what parliamentarians are now referring to as ‘the last-remaining civil rights issue’.These include:What legislation will be necessary to ensure that the new Derry-centred university will transcend both sides of the border, as regards teaching provision, RD, student intake and administration What legislation will be required from Dublin, London and Europe, to ensure revenue funding for a standalone cross-border university in the North West If a HE provider from Southern Ireland, where student fees are lower, were to become a partner in the new NW university, would fees here also be lower Is there any impediment to the National University of Ireland applying for a Charter to establish a university whose main campus is Derry  The report suggests that the institution seeking degree-awarding powers should be ‘physically operating’ in Northern Ireland. Can Derry Strabane Council be the anchor ‘operating’ partner, with NUI as the provider Can an accredited further education provider, such as the North West Regional College, apply for degree-awarding powers  What processes must it complete Derry Strabane Council is applying directly to the United Kingdom Governmentfor funding for a medical school for the North West. What action is council taking as regards applying to ‘UKG’, and other governments, for funding for an independent university for the North West Can Derry Strabane Council now operate its proposed Medical School with a new HE providerat Magee Will central government now increase the MaSN Cap, which restricts the number of HE students in the North, to accommodate the development of a new university in the North West Can central government ensure that the new independent NW university stays viable by ensuring that the minimum cap for the new institution remains permanently at ,  In February , the Department for the Economy, wrote to UU asking for ‘its rationale for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus’. Seven months on, UU still had not replied to its most signicant funder.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted

programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and

councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures llanfair caereinion celebrates deri woods centenary","story":"Caereinion High School Sixth Form students give a helping hand on the barefoot wltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtalking trail at Deriltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Woods.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever. We as a family remember Mark everyday but to know that these young men thought about him often too brings us a great deal of comfort.Mark was the youngest of the family of nine. He showed great promise as a soccer player, playing locally for Ballynahinch Olympic and catching the eye of Norwich City.Well-liked and respected, and much loved, Katie says that her family never realised that Mark was suffering with mental health issues.Katie said: ldquoMark was an extremely engaging young man who got an A in his  plus.

He was always laughing and his friends knew him as Quinny. He loved his family and friends.Katie said that Mark was buried in his Olympic strip and his jersey number  was retired by the club shortly afterwards.Ballynahinch Olympic has continued to honour Mark every year at their awards night presenting the Mark Quinn memorial cup to the young player of the year.Katie has also made a plea for those who feel le is a struggle to talk to someone.She said: ldquoIf anyone reading this is struggling, please let someone know. Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town.

He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days. It has a high profile in the media too which makes it easier for people to hold up their hands and admit that they are struggling with their own mental health.ldquoIn particular, young people feel a lot of pressure from unhealthy relationships with social media.ldquoBut still, suicide is still very high in Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and other parts of the county.

It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I want people to wake up in the mornings, and wonder lsquowhat shall we do today at Fonmon Castle rsquoThe first of these events, on Wednesday, August , will feature medieval re-enactments, living history displays, medieval combat lessons, have-a-go archery, childrenrsquos play areas and dino walks - and will be free.ldquoWe have so much history to offer as a country, said Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoI want to really start to show it off.To find out more, email info@fonmoncastle article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

safety and responsible dog ownership lessons for their students. Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukCarrick firefighters form guard of

Kelly Gardens in the Co Armagh town, qualied as a pharmacist in , graduated as a doctor in February this year and has been working at McCabe’s Pharmacy in the Northwood area of Dublin since May.The former St Michael’s Grammar School pupil explained: “The lady came into the shop struggling to breathe, she was in full-blown anaphylactic shock.”Emmett acted quickly and gave the woman an adrenaline shot: “I could see the rash on her neck so I knew she had an allergy.“I thought I’d have to do CPR. I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams. I know mum and dad were glad to see me get through it.”\"  \"  Malcolm McKeown Murder: Police release C.C.T.V. footage of car used by gunmanTop teacher warns on mental health time bomb over autism

Officers were on the roads carrying out speed checks and weren’t just saddened to be issuing ticketsbut were also saddened that no one waved at them.A spokesperson, posting to the PSNI Craigavon Facebook page on Thursday , said: “Today members of the Brownlow Neighbourhood Policing Team were out, as requested by you, to carry out speed ops within our area. “As a result of your requests we conducted speed ops on Drumgor West Road, Craigavon, Ballyhannon Road and Kernan Road, Portadown. Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us. That also saddened me as we are only out trying to keep everybody safe, so when you see us out and about please wave at us as it makes our day go in that bit quicker.”Family appeal for missing cat

The medical teams were incredibly calm, and it was very helpful in such a frightening situation.” Trevor continued, “I was in hospital for five days.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
