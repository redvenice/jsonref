We thought he was saying Be calm, it\u0027s OK but actually he was saying Get out of here - but be calm.\u0027Staff were collecting our beach chairs and instead of putting them in the usual spot they were grabbing them and throwing them to one side before running away.\u0027We realised it was a big deal when the locals started to freak out and were running for their lives. There were 20 other people on the beach.\u0027Lawyer Alana, originally from Melbourne, Australia, and who was with her fiancé Alex Barclay, 30, and future bridesmaid Charlotte Lewis, 28, described the terror of running back to their hotel, fearing further tremors could cause a rockfall.She added: \u0027We thought, We will be OK when we get back to our hotel.\u0027But we are in a mountainous area so running back we were concerned about potential tremors which could cause rocks to fall.\u0027We are worried that people may have died because there are tours which go around Stromboli, we were planning on going on it today but decided to do it tomorrow.\u0027We were also told people were getting boats out of the port because they feared a tidal wave could form which would destroy them, there are expensive superyachts in the area.\u0027                According to reports, the island of Stromboli was hit by a set of violent volcano eruptions spurring beach tourists to run into the sea         Fires are pictured on Stromboli island\u0027s west side after the eruption today, which killed one person and injured another         The explosion occurred just before 5pm and was described by one hotel worker, who heard a \u0027loud roar\u0027 Fiona Carter, a British tourist on neighbouring island Panarea, said: \u0027There was a loud boom and a huge plume of white and grey smoke rose up from Stromboli. The locals were clearly shocked. The cloud became a very big mushroom cloud. Then we saw streams of red-hot lava running towards the small village of Ginostra.\u0027The cloud continues to spread across the sky and Stromboli has disappeared from view. Highly unusual and huge explosion according to the locals.\u0027Hotel worker Michela Favorito described a \u0027loud roar\u0027 when the eruptions happened. \u0027We plugged our ears and after this a cloud of ash swept over us. The whole sky is full of ash,\u0027 she said.Student Luca Mariani, 14, from Rome, filmed the moment the smoke cloud towered over the island.Luca, who was sailing with his family in the Mediterranean Sea at the time of the eruption, said: \u0027I had never seen something like this. I didn\u0027t know whether to be scared or excited.\u0027The eruption also sparked bushfires on the island, which firefighting planes could not extinguish because of the dense clouds of smoke and ash.                \u0027The cloud got bigger, white and grey.

They are often dismissed as whimsical, bizarre and self-indulgent, novels just too wayward, too angry and too weird, made up of raging torrents of thoughts, ideas, memories, wordplay and sheer WAH!Well, the good news is that with Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann has clearly weighed up the opinions of her critics and the pros and cons of her trademark style, considered her options, and thought: “Damn the lot of you, I’m going to continue to write exactly the kind of novel I want to write, thank you very much.” In this case it turns out to be around 1,000 pages of an Ohio mother of four and homemaker worrying, mostly in one long sentence untroubled by full stops. She luxuriates in troubled descriptions of food, American family life “and the fact that the whole country’s gone crazee almost”. In her latest novel Ellmann doesn’t just carry on as before: she doubles down, doubles up and absolutely goes for broke.And it works. This may just be because everyone else has now caught up with Ellmann’s unapologetically super-self-conscious style. Readers who have been exposed to the work of, say, Sarah Manguso and Rachel Cusk, or even Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, will recognise Ellmann’s dauntless cataloguing of desires and hopes and fears, and her refusal to be anything other than endlessly curious and utterly self-directed.But there’s more. As well as Ellmann’s radical adherence to the idea that a novel might contain and appropriate anything and everything, and might therefore risk resembling a form of disorganised mental chatter, there is also in her work a thoroughgoing commitment to certain kinds of everyday human stories: in particular to the common longing for peace, love and understanding. This often gives her antic style a strong contrary motion towards a lulling kind of calm. In Ducks, Newburyport these two powerful impulses work together. Anne Tyler gets quite a few nods of appreciation throughout the book: well, imagine if Tyler wrote like Gertrude Stein.The book’s unnamed narrator is middle-aged and on her second marriage, to a kind man named Leo, who is an academic and engineer (“a cross between Stanley Tucci and Walter Matthau”). She has given up teaching history at college and become an expert pie-maker. Alongside her bright, brilliant rages as she stands in her kitchen and surveys the state of the nation while cooking up another consolatory batch of pies, the novel also contains a story about a mountain lioness, prowling outside, who does everything to nurture and protect her cubs. These two parts of the novel eventually come unexpectedly together, along with a hilarious, shocking confrontation with one of its many inexplicably angry men, who is intent on harming others and gorging on the narrator’s cookie dough.So, it’s a book about a mother’s love, but also about loss and grief, and anxiety dreams about Donald Trump, and despair about mass shootings and preppers and “the fact that Open Carry-type guys are always quoting from the Bible, and you get tired of hearing it all, the fact that can’t they read something else once in a while, like Babar or something”.It is also a catalogue of life’s many injuries and mishaps – the narrator undergoes a heart operation and gets cancer – and of the simple joys and consolations of memory and imagination. Ellmann’s wordplay is continual: “I’m always playing catchup, Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, coleslaw, BBQ sauce.” If you like this sort of delightful silliness, there is a lot of it: “the fact that maybe all parents like to see their children sleeping, partly because it means the parents can take a break, a coffee break, recess, recuse, breakdance, beatboxer, gravity benders, the fact that that dog on YouTube playing the piano and howling really seemed to be enjoying himself”. “The fact that” is the repeated phrase that holds the book together, making it into a kind of tally of what’s happening now, what has happened and – alas – what might happen in the future.In many ways, the book reads like a culmination. This is partly because of its extraordinary length and bold rhetorical devices, but also because it brings together elements from all Ellmann’s previous books: her great love of lists the endless references to popular culture the roarings and forebodings and glorious meanderings. I could tell you the significance of the ducks of the title, but that would cheat you of one of the great pleasures of the novel, which is just sticking with it and allowing the author to determine the pace and rhythm at which you read. “This book will either be a success or a failure,” remarks one character. “Nobody wants to hear that,” responds the narrator. Fair enough. Success? Failure? Triumph. • Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellmann is published by Galley Beggar (RRP £14.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

That is not this book.David McCullough puts the story much earlier, with the founding of what became the state of Ohio, and ends it during the civil war.At the Treaty of Paris in 1783, ending the American revolution, the Americans led by future president John Adams insisted on the cession of the lands north-west of the Ohio River to the Mississippi, the “Northwest Territory”. Settlement began in 1788.Those first settlers were the “foremost pioneers” in both the literal and figurative sense, facing hard work clearing land for agriculture, the threats of disease and war with Native Americans, among other dangers.It’s an important story. Ohio has always been a pivotal state and the founding of Marietta marks the beginning of organized settlement in the successive western frontiers. (Daniel Boone’s first emigrants to Kentucky left in 1773 but did so illegally, thanks to the Proclamation of 1763 limiting settlement to east of the Appalachian mountains.)The characters involved, including the Rev Manasseh Cutler (among the first and most successful lobbyists as well as a noted ine) Revolutionary war general Rufus Putnam and the Irish-born Harman Blennerhasset, who schemed with former vice-president Aaron Burr to split the republic, hold the reader’s interest.Equally, the settlement of the Northwest defined several important themes in American history. Notably, in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 Congress banned slavery in the territory and set aside land for public schools. As McCullough notes, this began what he terms “the American ideal” – a future in which free, educated people would form towns and bring order to the frontier. In 1802, Ephraim Cutler, the Rev Cutler’s son, arose from his sickbed to cast the deciding vote in the Ohio state constitutional convention, preventing slavery there – surely one of the most consequential legislative votes in American history.McCullough’s story of Campus Martius, the first settlement at what is now Marietta, offers a tantalizing glimpse of a road not taken, of a future more defined by communitarianism than inidualism:They were united in bonds of friendship like one great family, bound and held together in a common brotherhood by the perils which surrounded them. In after years, when each household lived separate in their own domicil, they looked back on these days with satisfaction and pleasure, as a period in their lives when the best affections of the heart were called forth and practiced towards each other.If this harkens back to similar remembrances of Plymouth or 17th-century Boston, many of the first settlers of Ohio were the descendants of Puritans who wanted to build a town “on the New England type”.Perhaps it was inevitable that an expansive frontier and a restless people would lead to inidualism becoming the dominant American ideology. But it is among the frustrations of this book that McCullough does not tease out the contrast more, instead simply passing along to the next events.The book resulted from the delivery of an address at the bicentennial of Ohio University and McCullough’s own research at Marietta College, in the town founded by the settlers along the “beautiful river”. It’s a superb regional history, with well-painted glimpses of the hardships and joys of frontier life and portraits of important early settlers. But overall it misses the chance to expand on broader themes hinted at throughout the book.There is a place for regional history – among other things, it would help Americans understand some of the roots of our enduring differences – but placing this narrative within a broader context, even of the settlement of the other states that became the midwest, would have made a stronger, more enduring work. The book should have been called Ohio! or something similar. One senses the title was dictated more by a publisher’s marketing department than the book’s contents.McCullough is among the most thoughtful and thorough historians of the past two generations. Read 1776, John Adams or the magisterial (and highly relevant) Truman to get the true measure of this great American mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/086c247d06f84988affd4566635e13cf63bd92c4/0_354_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eabe3b1957e688d6c6bcc5235e19b7d","title":"bumper payout for sainsburys boss mike coupe rattle agm","story":"Anger at £250,000 rise for Mike Coupe despite failed Asda merger and falling share price and profitsA bumper payout for Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe despite the collapse of a planned merger with Asda is expected to prompt questions at the annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.That came after Glass Lewis, another advisory group, told shareholders that Sainsbury’s had failed to outline how the failed merger with Asda had affected executive bonuses.

Although Canadian by birth, he holds Irish and UK citizenship. Carney is due to leave Threadneedle Street early next year.While Osborne’s bid may be harmed by Brexit and by a reputation for unhelpfulness during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, he reportedly told friends that his connections with the US and China, the two biggest world economies, may work in his favour.He may also hope for support from Boris Johnson, after throwing the weight of the Standard behind the former foreign secretary’s campaign for prime minister.Osborne was criticised for doom-laden warnings over the economy made before the EU referendum, as well as for the imposition of a long period of austerity on Britain, which is viewed as being one of the key reasons that fuelled the Brexit vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c732ab4d3d39e1f6ee494bdff8570bde1ef7a6c2/0_111_2588_1554/master/2588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75eb633244b10c9094a2f97c255edfa5","title":"george osborne imf job christine lagarde stock markets economy business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, including the latest runners and riders to run the International Monetary FundThe Daily  says Osborne is giving “serious thought” to filling the IMF vacancy, quoting one source who reckons:Or perhaps almost the only Brit with the ambition to even try.....It’s fair to say that reaction to George Osborne’s ambitions is decidedly mixed.His failed attempt to eliminate the UK’s budget deficit in the 2010-2015 parliament, through a harsh austerity programme, makes him ill-equipped. So argues Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman, for example, who tweeted ironically:But,  columnist George Monbiot remembers the IMF’s own track record in Argentina and Greece....Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Running the International Monetary Fund is one of the most important jobs in the global economy, You’re managing one of the pillars of the world order, monitoring global growth, lending to countries in crisis, and driving (for good or ill) a message of economic liberalisation.And much to many people’s surprise, former UK chancellor George Osborne thinks he’d do a good job of it.“Friends of Osborne” have thrown the chancellor’s hat into the ring, just a day after Christine Lagarde (the current IMF managing director), was nominated to lead the European Central Bank.Lagarde’s move (also a surprise) has triggered a flurry of speculation and some frantic CV polishing among the global elite. But could her job shift really hand the former MP for Tatton a shock comeback to the corridors of power?Osborne, it seems, believes he is well placed to win international support. He built up links with China during his time running the UK Treasury, and is also well-connected to US Republicans (who share his vision of a small state).That will help him win the necessary support. However, European leaders might be less impressed, if they remember Osborne’s criticism of the eurozone during its debt crisis.The IMF has never been led by a Brit (although John Maynard Keynes played a crucial role in its creation). Osborne believes he’s got the skills to change that.As the Financial Times puts it:Having recently backed Boris Johnson to become prime minister, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer — who now edits London’s Evening Standard — also has high hopes of winning the backing of a British government led by the former foreign secretary....Mr Osborne has told friends that it was a fascinating job to have at a challenging time for international institutions and the current climate required a “skilled political communicator and operator . . . not a technocrat”.But he faces a fight. Mark Carney, the current Bank of England governor, will soon have some time on his hands. India’s former top central banker, Raghuram Rajan, is another possibility (unless he succeeds Carney at the BoE!). There are also strong candidates from the world of business -- Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam and Mohamed El-Erian, the former chief executive of PIMCO, could be considered.So Osborne faces a tough fight if he’s to add another job to his lengthy resume (he’s currently editing the Evening Standard and advising fund manager BlackRock).It’s a quiet day in the markets, with America closed for the 4th July celebrations. Rather than trading stocks and shares, investors can enjoy the sight of tanks on the streets of Washington DC, with the Donald Trump “baby blimp” bobbing nearby.On the economics side, we get new UK car sales figures. They’ve been falling recently, with Brexit uncertainty dampening demand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9008715027da3a0c453d9f1ec30993936ff4cd2d/0_178_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef4a4354a365f43fac5c550f479b0740","title":"paul goldberger ballpark baseball american city","story":"To the critic and author of Ballpark: Baseball and the American City, the buildings dedicated to the game are as essential to American society as they are symbolic products of it“The ballpark,” Paul Goldberger says, “is a symbolic resolution of two things that remain unresolved in American culture.”The Pulitzer-winning critic is referring to urban and rural life, the city and the country, tensions he explores in his new book, Ballpark: Baseball and the American City.It is an engrossing read, starting in the teeming 19th century, soaring through baseball’s gilded age in the first half of the 20th and ending among the roofs, aircon and policed corporate spaces of the new millennium. It’s a work of architectural history and criticism but it can also be read as a history of baseball or of America and its cities. To Goldberger, the game and the buildings dedicated to it are as essential to American society as they are symbolic products of it.Discussing baseball’s beginnings, Goldberger says: “It did not spring like Athena from the head of Zeus.” It’s an appropriate phrase, as he’s speaking from a Greek island where he’ll deliver a lecture.Versions of the game came together over time. The familiar story that baseball was devised by Abner Doubleday and “played in the fields in Cooperstown, New York”, Goldberger says, is “a longstanding myth that has its roots in a very conscious attempt in the late 19th century to position the game as connected to a more elite and already vanished America”.As he shows, much early baseball was in fact suburban, played in “elysian fields” nonetheless close to the margins of cities. It was rackety and contradictory and competing groups fought to exert control. Like America itself.In the early 20th century the game shifted gears, building beloved city ballparks like Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn and Shibe Park in Philadelphia. Both are gone but in Chicago and Boston, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park continue to pull in the fans.Then came the mid-20th century when the game went national, the stakes were raised and what Goldberger calls “concrete doughnuts”, multi-use stadiums that sacrificed character to the car in seas of suburban parking, were the decidedly soulless result.Baltimore plays a key part in Goldberger’s book, its ballpark, built in 1992, showing how the game returned to the cities.“All types of buildings evolve,” he says. “Airports, hospitals, houses, schools and so on. But they generally evolve in fits and starts and steps, not in one single project after which everything else is completely different. But that certainly was the case with Camden Yards.”Oriole Park at Camden Yards, to give it its full name, replaced Memorial Stadium, a towering suburban venue. The new building did not have to host football too so its architects considered the best of traditional ballparks as well as the fans and their corporate masters. They took an industrial site in a post-industrial city and used it without sacrificing heritage or history.Camden Yards is on an old rail site, which leads to another key point.“While the railroads did not need baseball,” Goldberger says, “baseball needed the railroads. At first the various teams around Brooklyn and New York all played each other and could easily organize that. But you couldn’t organize a regular league with teams in Philadelphia playing teams in Cincinnati, which in turn would play a team in St Louis and Chicago, and Boston, and so forth, without the rise of inter-city train travel. So they went hand in hand.At the end of his book, Goldberger considers the privatisation of public space, a concern in many cities today. He casts an eye over SunTrust Park in Atlanta, an exurban setting where the Braves have built a facsimile of an urban space, ersatz, controllable and financially worth their while.Back in New York, there’s Hudson Yards and a ballpark that never was. The Yankees and Mets looked at the railroad site on the west side of Manhattan but nothing came together. What did open this year: a mesh of condo towers and malls with a sculpture dropped in the middle.Goldberger contends that unlike condos, offices and malls, “baseball integrates beautifully into cities”, which is “really the essential point of the book”. In short, he wishes the Yankees or Mets had succeeded.“I would love to have seen it,” he says. “It would have inoculated the developer very successfully against the not unreasonable claims that Hudson Yards is an enclave for the rich. It would have created a far better reason than Thomas Heatherwick’s sculpture for people to show up, to come there and walk around.“It would’ve left plenty of room for gazillion-dollar condos.

The helicopter carrying his hush-hush VIP visitor was expected soon. Staring through the Chequers windows at the lawn where the unmarked Sea King would soon land, prime minister Boris Johnson could hardly believe what he was about to do.Even by his standards, it had been a year of scrapes, of winging it and of close-run things that would have destroyed another leader. In the summer of 2019 he had defeated Jeremy Hunt by an unexpectedly narrow margin. A year ago he had led Britain out of the European Union without a deal.He had been cheered to the echo at the Tory conference. The Brexit party had plummeted in the polls. But things had gone quickly wrong elsewhere. Was it really 12 months already since British lorry drivers fought daily running battles with French customs officers in Calais? How long it seemed since British Airways announced it was relocating to Paris and Barclays moved to Dublin. The mass layoffs following the S\u0026ampP rating downgrade of Britain to BB status were especially traumatic.When the Russian owner of the Belfast Freeport was arrested for fraud in the spring, even he thought his government was doomed. It was probably only the shock royal orce in April, and the postponement of the general election, that had kept the show on the road this long. Just yesterday, two million people had marched through London in protest on the Brexit anniversary.There was a knock on the door. “President von der Leyen is here, prime minister,” the official announced. “Welcome to my Eagle’s Nest,” boomed the prime minister cheerily. The European commission president did not smile. “Let us get down to business, Boris,” she began. “Tell me. Is this serious?” And she placed on the table a file headed “Top secret: UK government application to rejoin”.Well, no, this isn’t entirely serious. Boris Johnson wears his principles more lightly than most. It is nevertheless highly improbable that a man who is currently clawing his way up the greasy pole would brazenly spurn his own cause in such a way. But who can say for sure? The pollster Peter Kellner made a plausible case this week that Johnson could end up calling a second referendum in order to retain power. As Kellner put it: “Changing his mind would be an addition to an already impressive list, not a break with any personal tradition of principled consistency.”It is high time to get serious. Time, so to speak, to take back control. For the past six weeks, the biggest public issue facing this country has in effect been privatised to the Conservative party’s internal processes. The debate about Brexit options has spiralled into a netherworld of faith-based outcomes and fundamentalist beliefs, in which the candidates have made promises they cannot keep about processes they do not control.Meanwhile the rest of us wait meekly for the outcome the Tory members demand. This is an act of collective negligence on the public’s part and an even more dangerous hijack of democracy by the minority of Tory MPs, led by Graham Brady, who successfully forced Theresa May out. Perhaps it will be reversed if Philip Hammond, David Gauke and perhaps even May herself can find a way of working across the House of Commons to stop the renewed drive towards a no-deal Brexit.Rationally, it is political madness to desire no deal. But the leadership contest has narrowed the debate about options, so that the difference between Johnson and Jeremy Hunt on no deal is increasingly difficult to discern. Both candidates know they will not be able to negotiate a new deal. Both have boxed themselves into not seeking an extension. Neither is likely to expend limited political capital trying to finesse a negotiated Brexit through an already uncooperative parliament.The contest has also used up a lot of precious time. The leadership election will be followed by a parliamentary recess, and in turn by the autumn conference season. With the Brussels EU leadership also in transition it becomes increasingly unrealistic to expect the two sides to find any new version of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration on which both can sign off, even if they both had the wish to do so. Which neither of them does.This is made more difficult by the continuing levels of what Ivan Rogers, Britain’s former EU negotiator, recently called the “denial, delusion-mongering and deception” that still envelop the Brexit debate. It is inconceivable that the new prime minister will stand on the Downing Street doorstep later this month and renege on the things he has been saying during the contest by warning the public to prepare for difficult compromises. Yet without that, and without an extension beyond 31 October, no deal is not an option. It is automatic.And that means that the UK will be in trouble, short-term or long – or both. Part of this is about tariffs. Mainly, though, it is about the ending of a preferential agreement on trading and commerce within the EU that has no replacement. No deal means no transitional period. This has instant negative consequences for checks on things such as industrial standards, financial regulation, phytosanitary provisions, aviation, road haulage, energy and tax. Why else, for instance, would a lifelong anti-EU politician such as the trade secretary, Liam Fox, now be so anxious to roll over existing EU free trade deals?Speaking on Wednesday at an Institute for Government event in London, legal, business and government experts filled in some of the more immediate practical consequences. Planes will still fly and energy supplies will not be shut off. But the practicalities of trade in goods and, in particular, services (where the UK has a surplus) will alter decisively.Some of this will be immediate. Calais will be a focal point as new checks apply and docks get clogged up. Other impacts will be more gradual as standards erge and forms become more complicated. Both are likely. The free port idea floated by Johnson in Belfast this week would create more barriers, not fewer. The mitigation payments to farmers proposed by Hunt are illegal. Sorting out new arrangements, which will be on EU terms, could take years.So forget about Wimbledon, the women’s football, the cricket and the summer holidays. Grasp instead that this is the month in which the Conservative party will decide to put modern Britain through the economic and political wringer simply in order to save its own skin from the Brexit party. No one voted for this, least of all in 2016. It would surely be better to remain than to have to rejoin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/873e09f6a377a0fd964b37a943982894ad4d88d9/0_104_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60215fee1bfa0cfa9d0d4d54ac44c2ff","title":"carry on films working class heyday","story":"Reports of a revival are hopefully wide of the mark. But for all their many flaws, the films carry a positive message, tooWhen I was growing up in the 1980s, grey Sunday afternoons were invariably spent in front of a Carry On film, while the adults snoozed in armchairs. Despite the homophobic jibes, the fat gags and the relentless groping of female characters, the films were seen as the ultimate in family entertainment. They didn’t seem so bad at the time. At the very least, we can credit Carry On Cleo, which starred Kenneth Williams as a neurotic Caesar, with giving us one of the great comic lines: “Infamy, infamy, they’ve all got it in for me.”Nowadays we might reasonably look upon the worst of the Carry On franchise as we do an elderly relative whose generous distribution of Werther’s Originals is accompanied by a stream of low-level bigotry. Certainly, primitive sight gags around bursting cleavages, and scripts that did somersaults in order to get Williams to utter the word “queer”, are more likely to make us cringe than cackle. As for the “browning up” of Bernard Bresslaw in Carry On Up the Khyber, let’s not even go there. And yet, Carry On nostalgia endures both in the national consciousness and in the intermittent efforts of film producers to reanimate the brand.This week has brought news that a comeback is on the horizon courtesy of the producer Brian Baker, who has been engaged in a lengthy legal battle with ITV, which owns the franchise, and who has finally been granted permission to fund a new movie. It’s by no means the first time a reboot has been proposed.In the early 1980s there was talk of Carry On Dallas, inspired by the American soap, a project that seemed surplus to requirements given the original’s capacity for self-parody. Happily, it never got off the ground. In 1992 the threat of a revival was carried through in the execrable Carry On Columbus. Not for nothing was it later designated the worst British film ever made, thus sealing the franchise’s latter-day reputation as a peddler of smirking, lowest-common-denominator tat.Why, then, do we persist in celebrating it? Would it be better simply to draw a veil over this apparently unedifying chapter in our cultural history? Viewed from a distance, the prejudice on display certainly isn’t pretty. Study the films more closely, however, and they also highlight much of what we have lost.When the first film, Carry On Sergeant, hit cinemas in 1958, expectations weren’t high. An attempt to cash in on the popularity of The Army Game, a Granada sitcom about postwar army life, it saw a soon-to-be-retired sergeant trying to turn a hopeless bunch of recruits into functioning soldiers. Shot in just a few weeks on a microscopic budget, it was nonetheless a hit, and a British institution was born. The series peaked commercially in the 1960s with Carry On Cleo, Carry On Doctor and Carry On Up the Khyber. It’s no coincidence that these titles arrived at a time of low unemployment and improved living standards, and when Harold Wilson, a former grammar school boy from Yorkshire, was prime minister. Carry On films were by no means radical social documents, but they nonetheless reflected the collapse of the age of deference and the strides made towards social equality. Compare that to where we are now, marooned in an era of stagnating wages, rising homelessness and record food-bank usage, with a bunch of public schoolboys gambling with Britain’s political future.These shallow, knockabout comedies had at their heart a distrust of authority, and never missed an opportunity to skewer the pomposity of supposed superiors. In the first film, it’s army sergeants that are deemed ripe for ribbing later it’s teachers, doctors, police constables and the grand poobahs of the British Raj. Putting aside the grim racist tropes in Carry On Up the Khyber, we see a film at once nostalgic for the empire while lampooning the vulgarity and arrogance of the British upper classes and their fabled stiff upper lip. Meanwhile, Carry On Nurse, the highest-grossing film of 1959, cast an unlikely spotlight on Britain’s new National Health Service.More broadly, in catering to a working-class audience, the Carry On films offered cinemagoers a chance to see versions of themselves on screen – a novelty however much they were caricatured. Look at the casting, too, and you see a film industry opening its doors to those who might previously have been consigned to below-stairs roles, or overlooked entirely. The franchise made stars of Kenneth Williams (son of a barber), Barbara Windsor (daughter of a fruit and veg seller), Sid James (son of a Jewish hairdresser) and Joan Sims (daughter of an Essex stationmaster). It’s hard not to compare this to today’s actors, increasingly the product of expensive educations and cushioned by family money. In a recent interview, the actor Vicky McClure spoke furiously of the advantages enjoyed by actors who have never encountered financial hardship – “if you haven’t got the funds, you haven’t got the same opportunities”.The Carry On films undoubtedly outstayed their welcome. With each striving to be bawdier and more outrageous than the last, they lost the daft humour that flourished in the era of censorship and struggled to find an identity in an increasingly permissive society. The final two pictures before the 1992 comeback – Carry On England (1976) and the odious Carry On Emmanuelle (1978) – bombed. Do we need a reboot? Of course not. The films were the product of a time and place and any efforts to make them palatable for today’s audiences will surely end in disaster. But to write them off entirely on account of their flaws would seem similarly ill-judged. Such hoary old relics are worthy of our reflection, showing us how far we have come, while reminding us what is yet to be done.• Fiona Sturges is an arts writer specialising in books, music, podcasting and TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6039783caaebd7578421e5a1740a5dbf662d817/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70e4d0cadd7145f6d7e3b36e89a76f24","title":"marshae jones alabama fetal rights alarmed","story":"The indictment of Marshae Jones is part of a larger trend of states criminalizing women for unintended pregnancy outcomesIn December, 28-year-old Marshae Jones saw a woman she didn’t like, Ebony Jemison, in the parking lot of a Dollar General in Pleasant Grove, Alabama, and confronted her. The fight turned physical, and Jemison shot Jones, who was five months pregnant, in the stomach. Jones was rushed to a hospital. She survived, but lost her pregnancy. The fetus had been struck by a bullet.Yet a grand jury indicted Jones – not Jemison – for manslaughter. Under Alabama law a fetus has the same rights as a living person, and the grand jury ruled that Jones had an obligation to avoid anything that could potentially cause harm to her pregnancy, like making herself available to be shot.The indictment follows on the heels of an amendment to the Alabama state constitution late last year giving fetuses the rights of people – the provision that made the indictment possible – and the state’s passage of a total abortion ban in May. After a national uproar, charges against Jones were dropped. But the Jones indictment is part of a larger trend, both in Alabama and nationwide, of states engaging in hostile surveillance of pregnant women, often with the collusion of doctors, and criminalizing women for their pregnancy outcomes. The campaign is the product of a mass moral panic based on a flimsy and misogynistic ethical calculation in which women have few claims to their own rights, dignity or freedom, but are burdened with greater and greater responsibilities to protect, care for and hold themselves accountable for the actions of others.This moral calculus can be seen in the growing number of prosecutions of women, predominantly women of color, found to have used drugs while pregnant. In Jones’s home state of Alabama, a draconian provision called “chemical endangerment” has been used to imprison women who are addicted to drugs for the crime of endangering their fetuses. In some cases, women are tested for drugs without their consent and reported to police by their doctors. According to ProPublica, the chemical law has led to 479 arrests in Alabama.“Chemical endangerment” can be invoked against women who test positive for drugs even if their pregnancies are perfectly fine. But the statute is wielded with specific cruelty against those who lose their pregnancies through miscarriage or stillbirth. In 2011, a woman who gave birth to a stillborn boy took a plea deal of 10 years in prison for the stillbirth this was to avoid a life sentence. Laws against “fetal endangerment” have also been used against women who attempt suicide other laws have been used to prosecute women who miscarry and are found to have illegally disposed of fetal remains. Theoretically, they can enable prosecutions of pregnant women engaged in perfectly legal, nonviolent and even accidental activities, like drinking wine, playing sports or tripping down some steps – even when those activities do not end the pregnancy.In order for prosecutions like that of Marshae Jones to make sense, the fetus needs to be considered not only a person, but a special class of person, one with not only all the same rights and privileges of living, sentient, autonomous human beings, but quite a few extra rights and privileges on top of those. Writing in the London Review of Books, the novelist Sally Rooney reflected on the 2018 Irish abortion referendum: “If the foetus is a person, it is a person with a vastly expanded set of legal rights, rights available to no other class of citizen: the foetus may make free, non-consensual use of another living person’s uterus and blood supply, and cause permanent, unwanted changes to another person’s body.”When the fetus is considered a person it not only has these rights over its mother, but also the right to have its interests represented – it is not uncommon in these cases for the state to appoint a lawyer to represent the interests of the fetus. It has the right to have these interests represented even though it does not articulate these interests itself: the fetus cannot speak, and if it could it is not clear that it would have anything to say. Instead, its rights are determined by third parties, often church groups or Republican state legislators, who presume to speak for the fetus, and do so by speaking over the voice of the person who would otherwise be considered the fetus’s next of kin: the woman pregnant with it.As fetal rights expand even beyond those of real people, women’s rights contract into something significantly less than legal personhood. Pregnant women lose the freedom to determine their own lives, to choose what to eat and how to exercise and where to go. And they gain a substantial burden for the welfare of others – specifically for the fetus, which is recognized as a person but not endowed with any responsibility to itself or to the woman who carries it. In Jones’s case, the pregnant woman is assigned responsibility for not only her own actions but for those of other people who choose to hurt her.In choosing to indict Marshae Jones, the state of Alabama has blamed her for her own shooting, employing the same misogynistic, victim-blaming logic that asks a rape victim what she was wearing. One wonders what kind of life a woman would have to lead to meet the unusually high bar for personal safety and responsibility these cases set for pregnant women. I can only imagine that the lives these laws want pregnant women to lead are very limited indeed. That seems to be the point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/517e62c31e0b4f7e81419e0c57a60a868e078408/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c4c31c98a867c2d057fc2584777aad3","title":"what stress is like ask friend from local authority","story":"All day long, he makes life-changing decisions for the people he lives among. How many politicians could cope?I was sitting on a tram in Birmingham when a guy tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I was me. “I just had to ask,” he said, “or I’d never have forgiven myself. I would always have wondered.” I felt most unworthy of this level of interest, and told him so.As we walked down Corporation Street together I asked him what he did for a living. It turned out he was on his way home from work at a local authority, where it was his job to decide whether or not people had the means to pay for their residential care. As I understand it, if you’ve got nothing, then the council pays. If you’ve got savings, then you pay. Which is obviously fair enough on one hand, but not so fair on the other if you, unlike your neighbour, have saved diligently all your life. Why should they get the benefit? Where’s the incentive to save at a time when everyone is being told to save more? I shared these incredibly wise thoughts with my new friend. And do you know, his expression suggested that all the above might have been suggested to him before.“I know,” he said. “Privately, I know. I get all that. But what can I do? It’s my job.”“It must be so stressful,” I replied.“It is very stressful,” he agreed.I rub shoulders and share studios all the time with politicians whose job it is to make difficult decisions as to who gets what. Must be tough, but not half as tough as being one of the many public sector workers who have to make the big calls on the ground, while breathing the same air as those they sit in judgment on.We shook hands and I asked him what he was up to that evening. “Just telly, I suppose,” he said with a shrug. “It’s a school night.”• Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304d0e087810e4968a898f9c79605329523ba3ec/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b17e9b2da686bd7e072e51832f39ae","title":"ashes to ashes 20 how womens cricket developed to embrace new formats","story":"Ahead of this summer’s Women’s Ashes tour, Kalika Mehta takes a look back at the tournament’s history, from its unofficial beginning in the 1930sAlthough women’s competitive cricket dates back to the foundation of the Women’s Cricket Association (WCA) in 1926, it wasn’t until eight years later that an England team set sail for Australia for their first “unofficial” Ashes tour.With the hosts refusing to pay travel expenses, the team consisted of players who could afford the considerable £80 – nearly £5,000 in modern-day terms – charged by the WCA. If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life.

Sadly, it wasn’t a very successful campaign war has remained incomprehensibly popular even as the song itself has become ubiquitous – it topped a 1999 poll to find Britain’s favourite song lyric. Written as the Vietnam war raged, Imagine now seems clearly influenced by Lennon’s wife, Yoko Ono, and her 1964 book Grapefruit, a collection of instructions that stand in for physical artworks. “Imagine the clouds dripping. Dig a hole in your garden to put them in,” run the familiar-sounding instructions for Cloud Piece.Ono wouldn’t be given a songwriting credit on Imagine until 2017, but by 1971 she had already become the most significant artistic influence on Lennon since Chuck Berry. For decades, Ono was vilified by rubber-necking journalists and bitter Beatles fans alike, and her work – encompassing some of the most provocative and original feminist art of the era – was largely ignored. (Lennon once called her “the world’s most famous unknown artist”.) But at the turn of the millennium, the Japanese conceptualist finally began to be recognised as a major artist, with international retrospectives and even a reunion of the Plastic Ono Band, her caterwauling avant-rock ensemble, whose albums repelled 70s critics but inspired a generation of punks such as Sonic Youth.The world’s perception of her may have changed, but today the famously dogged Ono is still banging the same drum – or, more accurately, ringing the same bell. In her latest artwork, she is enlisting thousands of ordinary folk to ring in this year’s Manchester international festival with Bells for Peace, a mass participatory artwork that returns to her most enduring theme.At 6pm on Thursday, Manchester’s Cathedral Gardens will resound with the peals of 4,000 ceramic bells, handmade and engraved for the occasion, along with the mightier clangs of a huge Buddhist bell and antique church bells. Those will be harmoniously tuned, but the festival is also encouraging the public to bring along their own bells: the result, you imagine, will be a kind of joyful discord. (As well as being free and open to the public, the event will also be livestreamed through the MIF website.)Spend some time turning that sentence over in your head, like a Zen koan, and something instructional eventually falls out. The problem with peace, Ono suggests, is that it inevitably struggles to cut through our frantic, accelerated lives it’s our responsibility to make space for peace purposefully, rather than expecting it to come to us. Bells for Peace brings people together in a single moment to pause, reflect and recharge our imaginations.Two years before Lennon wrote Imagine, the newly married couple spent their honeymoon in a hotel bed, surrounded by cameras. Their Bed-Ins for Peace merged Lennon’s rock’n’roll populism with Ono’s avant garde audacity, honed through her radical performances such as Cut Piece, in which she sat calmly as her audience cut off her clothes with scissors. Through the Bed-Ins, John and Yoko merged their life with art and laid the groundwork for the next generation of pop protest, from Red Wedge to Live Aid. When I quiz her on whether art can really bring about political change, there’s still a hint of revolutionary thinking at work. “Art is just part of the world,” she deflects. “We have to rely on people, including yourself. Not government. Governments always have red tape. Our imaginations don’t.”As one of the most visible artists of her generation, Ono’s influence is subtle but huge, running through several generations of younger artists, from the Guerrilla Girls’ feminist critique of the art world, to Marina Abramović’s provocative performances, to the many artists, including Sam Taylor-Johnson, who have made music along with visual art.“As soon as you start becoming aware of the tradition of body art and conceptual art, you realise that a lot of it is rooted in her practice from many decades previously,” says John McGrath, Manchester international festival’s artistic director. At the core of it all is Ono’s conception of art “as something that the public completes – an invitation to the public to make the work with her”.Two years ago, the festival made the decision to kick off with a public event – a commissioned work of art rather than fireworks or fancy ceremony. Jeremy Deller was chosen to initiate this tradition, which he did by inviting 150 Mancunians to walk a fashion runway above the city’s bustling transport hub, Piccadilly Gardens. Painting a portrait of Manchester through its people – dog walkers, doctors, a cab driver who offered free rides after the terror attack at Manchester Arena in 2017 – the commission had “an extraordinary response,” says McGrath.Ono was the obvious choice to continue this new tradition. After gauging her interest, McGrath soon found himself in Ono’s living room in the Dakota Building, the New York block where she has lived since 1973. “What we really wanted was what she became excited about,” says McGrath, “which was a mass participatory artwork. One of the things she always said is that peace isn’t absence of war – peace is a thing that you have to do, together, and the ringing of bells together is her expression of that.”Ono breezes through the rest of my questions. What’s the best thing about being in your 80s? “By then you will know how to live.” When was the last time a work of art affected you deeply? “I feel that a work of art, depending on how you see it, affects us all the time. The beautiful sky, like today.” What can I do to boost my imagination? “You are already improving.” Glad to hear it.Working with an artist who makes a virtue of deflection comes with its challenges. “You ask a question and the answer you get isn’t necessarily the practical, head-on answer,” says McGrath with a chuckle. “Sometimes the answers require some thought and interpretation. But then she’ll make these leaps – I sat there in one meeting with quite a few people and we were talking about the whole ethos of peace behind the work, and suddenly she says: ‘Maybe we’re going to end up with too much peace and we’ll need some revolution instead!’ So she also has that capacity to turn the thing on its head. There isn’t Yoko Ono the work separate to Yoko Ono the person. How she exists in the world is very much an embodiment of the work that she makes.”Whether she’s issuing art instructions by tweet, inviting us to write down our wishes and hang them on a tree, or daring us to slice off her clothes, Ono’s work is always an attempt to pull people towards each other, simultaneously cracking open our fears and desires. The phrase “audience participation” can strike fear into the hearts of uptight unbelievers, but for Ono there’s nothing better, as she notes with bitesize wisdom: “Because when 20 birds are singing, it’s very beautiful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb4c84e10525bb7a8edc5040f88f7c6cb040afa/0_7_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c69065a20512e025bffbd6afd12c783c","title":"ontario the year round holiday destination","story":"Hikers, bikers and wine aficionados will find something to love in Ontario. Here’s our guide to the best things to do in the region, season by seasonSpring is a good time to join a historic or culinary walking tour of Toronto or Ottawa, don’t forget to fuel up in one of the many good coffee shops. Queues are much shorter at major attractions such as Niagara Falls, so why not take a Hornblower Niagara Cruise, a ride on Niagara Helicopters or a thrilling MistRider zipline ride? The spring weather is ideal for bike tours of Niagara’s wineries, distilleries and craft breweries, such as Niagara Oast House Brewers.If you would like to see where maple syrup comes from, around March is the time to join a Sugar Bush tour to see how the trees are tapped or find a pancake festival in April to enjoy the end product. This season is also a good time to go hiking before the crowds come out and the weather heats up. The Bruce Trail (Unesco biosphere designated) stretches from the Niagara Escarpment to Tobermory, 500 miles of scenic trails, while you don’t even need to leave Toronto to hike the forested slopes of the 16 hectare (40-acre) High park.Summer unofficially starts on the third weekend of May with the Victoria Day holiday marking Queen Victoria’s birthday. It’s the start of cottage season, when all roads lead to Georgian Bay, Muskoka or Lake Simcoe, for barbecues, watersports and weekend partying at Ontarians’ seasonal residences. With the weather hot and humid, Ontario has endless supplies of water to cool off in paddle or cruise around the 1,000 Islands near Kingston, sail on the Great Lakes, or enjoy a canoe or kayak adventure on one of the many lakes or rivers in Muskoka. Whitewater raft just 90 minutes from Ottawa, along the Ottawa River or take a LeBoat cruiser along the Rideau canal to Kingston.Don’t miss the waterways of Algonquin park – Justin Trudeau spent his childhood summers here. Like living life on two wheels? Then Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron in Northern Ontario is the place to be, with over 800km of road-biking routes.Summer is the peak season for festivals – starting with the major fun around Canada Day on 1 July anywhere in Ontario, and then you have choices that range from the Niagara wine festival to TIFF (Toronto international film festival), taking in Nuit Blanche art projects at major art venues, and even music and food truck festivals. Let’s not forget Glengarry Highland Games, the Whitchurch-Stouffville strawberry festival and the Toronto Summerlicious food festival, where more than 200 restaurants offer specially priced set menus, among many others.As the leaves start to fall, enjoy the abundance of colours in Ontario’s thousands of miles of forest. Allow two weeks for a proper fly-drive tour from Toronto of highlights including Niagara, Blue Mountain, Muskoka, Algonquin park, Ottawa, 1,000 Islands and Prince Edward County. September and October are also prime times for spotting the northern lights ride the Polar Bear Express  from Cochrane to Moosonee for your best chance of catching this natural phenomenon.In Ottawa, this is a good time to visit the National Gallery of Canada, the city’s premier art collection, or the fascinating Canadian Museum of History, the most visited museum in the country. Take a cycle tour to explore the capital’s many interesting neighbourhoods such as Byward Market and Centretown, indulge in a craft brewery tour or a food tour (or both!). Overindulgence in good food and drink peaks around Canada’s Thanksgiving in October. Major events to look out for include the Blue Mountains apple harvest festival, Bala cranberry festival, and Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest. Many small towns have their own homely harvest and pumpkin festivals, complete with family fun such as traditional music and ploughing matches.As the snowfall peaks, ice hockey fills the TV schedules but it’s even more fun to get out and enjoy the winter wonderland for yourself. This is the time of year when the mist and spray off Niagara Falls freezes on the rocks, adding to the spectacle. For skiing, Blue Mountain is Ontario’s largest resort and great for beginners. Resorts in the Blue Mountain region or Muskoka, such as the luxurious JW Marriott Rosseau, Sherwood Inn, and Cedar Grove Lodge, or Deerhurst in Huntsville offer activities including cross-country skiing, skating, snow shoeing, snowmobiling and dog sledding, with a whole menu of spa treatments to ease any tired muscles.Ontario’s many spas include award-winning ones in Niagara and Prince Edward County, perfect for a break at any time of year but even cosier when the weather is chilly outside. At St Anne’s spa, 90 minutes from Toronto, you can even get wrapped in hot chocolate. For festive festivals, look out for Winterlude in Ottawa, with ice-carving, skating and curling the Icewine festival in Niagara Falls (which also celebrates its food), Winterlicious in Toronto (more seasonal culinary delights!), and Sault Sainte Marie’s Winter Carnival Bon Soo, complete with polar bear swims (where you swim like one, through an ice hole, rather than with one).Discover more of what Ontario has on offer all year round with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

Earlier this year, Norway’s national oil fund began to refocus on renewable energy. About two-thirds of the UK’s university pension funds, as well as other public pension funds, have also either ested or changed their rules, though some have retained their fossil fuel focus despite strong public pressure.Other funds to have ested include the Irish infrastructure fund, the New York state pension fund, and Waltham Forest and Southwark councils in the UK.Peter Vermeulen, the trust’s chief financial officer, said many organisations had been working hard to persuade fossil fuel companies to invest in green alternatives, without success.“These companies have made insufficient progress and now we have decided to est from fossil fuel companies,” he said.“Now we will seek to invest in green startup businesses and other suitable portfolios that deliver benefits for the environment, nature and people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3ef84cc85aa38ce0f0c74e60c42e9ed4ef94840/0_969_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a49b46c75ca70c36b7fbf4b0762450f","title":"i dont see jeans in my future the people who wear complete historical dress every day","story":"From the man who wears 17th-century clothes to the woman whose outfits are straight out of the 1950s, six people explain their deep devotion to period dressIt is a bold and often ostentatious choice, but historical dressing can be more than just a novelty means of self-expression. As with any clothes, they are a way of presenting ourselves to the world. And for some, that means wearing top hats, breeches, doublets, or Bakelite jewellery. Below, six period dressers explain their choices:These are everyday clothes of the early 19th century. I never leave the house without a hat and I tend to walk around with a cane, too. A lot of what I wear at the moment is Regency style.I’ve been dressing alternatively since I was 14 because modern fashion has never appealed to me. I wanted to look back to a time when things were of a higher quality and wear clothes that would make me stand out. I began wearing late-Victorian and Edwardian stuff bought in vintage shops in Brighton and it made me genuinely happy. I got into the Regency look because I was invited to a Regency ball in London and had nothing to wear. I tried to make something myself, but realised it was terrible since I couldn’t find the right fabrics, so I decided to research the history and develop my own skills.The Regency period was the last hurrah of men’s fun with fashion, when people could be loud with colour and exuberant. The jackets, cravats, trousers – all of it is just wonderful to wear. It’s comfortable, too, and since I make it all myself, it makes me proud to have it on. It’s also a great ice-breaker.My clothes take time and it’s all about learning to be slow, rather than buying into fast fashion, which is unethical and so removed from the production process. You are who you are and you have to get on with it I feel very much at home in what I wear and how I wear it.I haven’t really had any backlash – people have been very inquisitive and polite to me. I don’t see jeans in my future. If anything, I see something more extreme.My style is 1940s and 50s inspired. When I was in my early 20s, I was living in Australia and I started going to secondhand shops because I didn’t have much money. I realised I could buy all the princess dresses that I loved as a little girl cheaply so I started with 1980s clothes and then worked my way back, before settling on the 40s as my style. It’s more comfortable for me and it’s very girly when I cut my hair short, I didn’t want to look boyish, so these clothes are lovely and feminine.When I dress, it makes me feel like myself. I’m in awe of people who look good in just a white T-shirt and jeans, but this style gives me that comfort. Dressing up brings so much joy into my life: sometimes, when I’m sad, I just want to wear colourful clothes because they cheer me up and make me want to go out.In my experience, it’s rare to see people of colour in the vintage scene. I think it might be because we’re already minorities, so we don’t want to draw more attention to ourselves by virtue of the clothes we’re wearing. I grew up with being westernised as the goal, and vintage clothing from my culture highlights the fact that I’m different and, in the current political climate, perhaps sometimes we don’t want to be different.The most important thing is that people wear clothes that are more sustainable and that they use them. Vintage clothes are made to last and it’s made me learn to sew because I have to take care of these clothes – they have survived 80 years and they can’t die in my care.My style is rooted in the 1930s. I always wear trousers with braces, made from a natural material such as cotton or linen, a collarless shirt, a bakerboy cap and leather shoes. I started off doing it because I’m a carpenter and I got a back injury about eight years ago, so there was a practical side to wearing high-waisted trousers with braces that took the pressure off my back and I really liked pairing them with the 30s style.The way I dress led me into 30s culture. I started playing jazz saxophone and got into the dancing of the period, where the clothes really take on a new purpose. It’s nice for iniduals to express themselves in life. I’m not trying to be anything I’m not, I just feel good dressing like this, and it gives other people a sense of who I am. It’s all positive.I’ve always been interested in clothes even when I was at school I had my own sewing machine and I would adapt clothes or paint them. People would give me a hard time because I was an eccentric, but I was determined to be the way I was and now, as an adult, it doesn’t bother me. People don’t have anything to say.Dressing this way is the future – buying fewer clothes and adapting them. We need to value craft and pay someone for doing their job.I dress in 17th-century clothes from the civil war period. I reenact the war and I like the clothes, so I wear them every day. A typical outfit would be a shirt, breeches, doublet, shoes and a hat. I make a lot of my clothes myself and some I buy from traders at re-enactment events. I read books on the patterns of the period and the methods of manufacture and do what I can.Towards the end of the 90s, I was working at a historical property in Wolverhampton and a mate of mine joined a civil war re-enactment society. He persuaded me to come along. Initially, I would only wear the clothes at the re-enactments, but then they started to seep into my everyday wardrobe and, since 2005, I’ve been wearing them all the time. They’re comfortable and I like the style, so I wear it. It means I don’t have to worry about today’s trends. They do for me what any clothes do: provide warmth and avoid nakedness.I’m self-employed as a guide to a National Trust property, which is in a 1930s modernist style, and some people can be a little thrown to have me there in 17th-century clothing to show them around. But most seem not to bother.I don’t tend to get much backlash some people might shout on the street that I look like Robin Hood, but they need to learn their history Robin Hood was dead by 1200 and these clothes were current by 1640. Generally, people just say it looks like fun.I wear clothes from the 1940s and 50s a typical outfit would be a pair of 30s-style culottes with a little blouse, a 40s sweater and wide-legged pants, or a 50s Gypsy skirt. I’ve been into it since I was 14 years old: that was in the 80s when there were a lot of subcultures happening, from mods to punks. I used to look at the mod girls at school and thought they were fantastic – I wanted to be part of the crew. I started out with 60s clothes and moved back to the 50s as a young adult and have settled on it ever since.I just think it’s so much more glamorous and classy – it makes me feel more special when I wear it, because modern clothing can look so tacky and bland. The clothing I wear is much more colourful and vibrant and I’ve always lived with furniture and decorations from that period, too – it’s become my whole lifestyle. We’ve redecorated our house to replicate the 50s style. I couldn’t live in a grey, modern design, I’d be so depressed. Living in the midst of all this colourful mid-20th-century design gives me so much pleasure. This is what I live in and what I wear because it makes me feel good. People say it makes me look younger, too!I collect clothes from the 1930s to the 50s. An everyday outfit would probably be a vintage picture- or border-print skirt with a Gypsy top and Bakelite jewellery.My dad’s an actor and he was really into old movies, so when I was young, we would watch all the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals together on a Sunday. I always wanted to be Ginger Rogers and I always wanted to dance. When I was in my 20s, I discovered a place in central London where you can go lindy hop or jive dancing and, through going there, I met people who dressed this way and knew the places to get the original clothes. I could finally be Ginger Rogers.That was in about 1996 and I’ve been dressing this way ever since. I wish I’d known it existed before that because I definitely would have started earlier.I love this era of clothes – it’s colourful and you feel so good when you dance in it, especially with men in wide-legged trousers. It’s a far more glamorous era than the one we live in now things can feel so scruffy with just T-shirts and jeans around. Wearing those clothes makes me feel as if I’m inhabiting a different time and they’re such exciting, unique pieces to own.It is important to buy clothes that suit you and your shape, which also bring something distinctive to your day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba8e71e61e540e0343052e9f9c9bb93105e8ff60/0_766_1757_1054/master/1757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95178efc63066dfea371adf3aac85821","title":"what to wear july five looks five occasions","story":"As the weather hots up, shorts, playsuits and lightweight dresses are the order of the day, whether you’re watching Wimbledon or heading to the beach"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c9a43914eb8c16eeeccc5926805ed1c162d8272/2196_456_4792_2876/master/4792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24b2de31aa6698ec22c62ce554fb2cd6","title":"lemon drizzle cake recipe masterclass felicity cloake","story":"Minimal effort, maximum results: step-by-step instructions for making a cake that always goes down a stormAlthough I love all my recipes equally, this lemon drizzle cake has a special place in my heart – feedback suggests it’s gone down a storm with everyone from a mums and babies group in Hackney to a master patissière in Paris – principally, I suspect, because the ratio of effort to results is skewed so heavily in the cook’s favour. Fluffy, yet deliciously sticky, it’s a proper crowdpleaser.175g butter, softened, plus a little extra to grease2 unwaxed lemons175g caster sugarFine salt3 eggs100g self-raising flour75g ground almondsA little milk100g demerara sugarGrease a 2lb loaf tin (ie, one measuring about 23cm x 13cm x 7cm) with butter or oil, and line with greaseproof paper. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.Zest the lemons – if you haven’t got unwaxed (or organic) ones, give them a good scrub with hot water to remove some of the wax first, because this will give a better flavour.If you’ve forgotten to take the butter out of the fridge, cut it into cubes and leave it near the warm oven or give it a few good whacks with a rolling pin to help it on its way. (Microwaving will just melt the outside, which isn’t ideal.) Put the cubed butter in a large bowl, or in the bowl of a food mixer, with the caster sugar, a pinch of fine salt and half the lemon zest.Use electric beaters to beat the butter and sugar mix until it’s really light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary this should take about five minutes. You can do this with a wooden spoon, but it will take a while, because you want to get as much air into the mix as possible.Beat together the eggs in a jug, then beat them into the butter and sugar mixture a little at a time, making sure each addition is thoroughly incorporated before adding any more. If the mixture threatens to curdle at any point, add a little of the flour to bring it back to a smooth consistency.Tip the flour into a sieve and sift it on top of the butter and sugar mixture – though this is not vital, it will help to give a lighter, fluffier result, so I’d recommend it. Use a large metal spoon gently to fold in the flour with a slow, figure-of-eight motion, being careful to knock as little air out of the mix as possible.Put the ground almonds in a bowl, give them a quick whisk to break up any lumps, then fold into the batter in the same way as the flour. Gradually mix in just enough milk to thin down the batter to a consistency that will reluctantly drop off a spoon.Pour the batter into the prepared tin and gently level the top. Put in the hot oven and bake for about 50-55 minutes, or until the top is golden and risen, and a skewer pushed into the centre comes out clean, or at least without any wet batter clinging to it a few crumbs are fine.Juice both lemons and mix this with the demerara sugar and the remaining lemon zest. Leave the cake in the tin, and poke small holes evenly all over the top, then pour over the drizzle bit by bit, waiting for it be absorbed before adding any more. Leave the cake to cool in its tin before turning out.This cake is an easy one to customise: swap lemon for other citrus fruits or add a dash of gin or vodka to the drizzle or make a spiced version by bringing the demerara sugar to a boil with 100ml water, the lemon zest and a tablespoon of squashed cardamom pods until the sugar dissolves, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse while the cake bakes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67a7c6a9ce4944f4f30d1d0ae56ced0ff1a2d3b/0_348_7157_4295/master/7157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7eecd4cbc1dbb52498ea8fce2dffb7","title":"garlic pineapple pomegranates the definitive guide to peeling 11 of the trickiest foods","story":"Why shell a boiled egg when you can squeeze it out, or use your fingernails on an orange when a knife is quicker? Here’s how to make life in the kitchen much easierWhen the Toronto foodie Valentina Bachkarova-Lord recently posted a video of her favourite way to peel a head of garlic, Twitter went crazy. “ALL THIS TIME??” was the viral reaction, as in: “We’ve been doing it wrong all this time?” Just months before, there was a similar furore over a pineapple-peeling hack in which two manicured hands literally pulled apart a pineapple no slicing or dicing, no juice, no mess. It would appear that – right up there with grumpy cats and happy dogs – peeling produce “the right way” is a surefire means of grabbing the world’s attention.The garlic and pineapple videos have now racked up tens of millions of views (23.8m and 13.4m, respectively). Of course, it is entirely possible that this owes less to culinary curiosity than to our phone addiction. As the New Yorker’s Helen Rosner put it, the videos hit “all the same tension-and-release dopamine levers as (uggghhh) pimple-popping videos”. But that didn’t stop her from stubbornly trying – and failing – to peel a bulb the way the woman in the garlic video did. In fact, it landed her in the emergency room, getting five stitches in her middle finger. So, perhaps Bachkarova-Lord’s method isn’t the right way?Beyond garlic and pineapple, there are hacks for peeling avocados, eggs, ginger, mangoes, onions, oranges, pistachios, pomegranates and potatoes. (Also kiwis: the peeling trick being that you don’t need to peel a kiwi, just eat it whole, like an apple. Bonkers.) But do they actually work? I put 11 to the test.Add a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to your boiling water (to increase the alkalinity and make the egg easier to peel). When cooked, run the egg under cold water until just cool enough to handle, then crack at either end to make holes. Now you have two options: if you’re up for a challenge, hold the big end up to your mouth with one hand, and blow hard to catch the egg with your other hand as it flies out of the small end. Or else, squeeze lightly until it plops out. Both work.Instead of shredding your fingertips and breaking your nails trying to pull open nuts that have barely split, use an empty pistachio shell. It is thin enough to slide into any gap, however slim, and hard enough for you to be able to lever it and prise the closed nut open. A revelation.Many a food blogger’s favourite hack: you use the edge of a teaspoon to just scrape the skin off. The spoon gets into all the folds and creases a knife just can’t deal with, meaning you can use the whole root, knobbly bits included. And it is so easy.Not a hack so much as proper chef’s training. Slice the bulb vertically straight down the middle, through the root. Peel the papery outer layers off one half, then lay it flat-side down on your board and, holding firmly by the root, slice from the pointy end to just above the root, keeping the latter intact. Slice again at right angles to these cuts to obtain a pile of perfectly diced onion.The viral video shows someone pulling the fruit apart, segment by easy segment, like you might a cinnamon bun traybake. However, as countless failed attempts to replicate it prove, this only works if you have what’s called a “snack pineapple”, and not the whoppers from Costa Rica sold at Sainsburys and my local street market. Even rolling one of these firmly across your work surface a couple times to loosen the fibres, and scoring it in places before attempting to pull it apart, only results in all the juice on the floor and a mound of unappetising fibres. Nah. Use a knife.Slice in half, then whack the stone head-on with the sharp edge of a big knife and twist and pull the knife out to remove the stone. Then run a dessert spoon between the flesh and skin of each half, to remove intact before slicing thinly. Smoothly does it.Score a raw spud around its waist in a very light, continuous line, then boil until tender. Once cooked, you’ll see the peel pulling back from the cut, ready for you to slide off in a single movement.By far the most aesthetically pleasing of these culinary hacks. Cut around the calyx – that spiky protrusion on one end – until you can pull it out. You should now see the seeds grouped into segments ided by white membranes. Score the skin of the pomegranate on the outside, from top to bottom, following those membranes. The fruit will then fall open like a flower.The Bachkarova-Lord way – which involves holding a bulb root-side-up, sticking a paring knife into clove after clove and, with a small amount of pressure, twisting them out of their papery sheaths – doesn’t work for me, until I find the YouTube channel Glen \u0026amp Friends Cooking’s explanation. The trick is to first score the unpeeled head, all around the base of the cloves, where they meet the root. Once you have done that, twisting them out, one by one, with your knife is a doddle. But it is only worth doing if you need a heck of a lot of garlic. For a clove or two, pressing with the flat of your knife is perfectly acceptable.Another revelation. Stand your fruit on its end and rotate it so you can slice straight down on either side of the pip to remove it.

Bronze is certain they will right that.“We came here to win this World Cup – we’ve fallen short,” Bronze said. “We wanted to make it to the final because we haven’t quite made it there but the fact that we are consistently reaching semi-finals showed how immense this team is and the strengths of this team.Bronze, having dominated the England narrative as the jewel in Phil Neville’s crown, was disappointed with her performance on her home pitch in Lyon. “I was just disappointed with myself, disappointed in the first goal,” the right‑back said. “That’s not something I’m used to I’m used to being defensively solid. No matter what people say about me as an attacker I always want to defend my player well and I’m disappointed that I didn’t do that to my best.”The 27-year-old was realistic about the demands involved in being an elite athlete. “I’ve played about 100 games this season … To play that many consecutive games is tough but it’s no excuse. We’re professional athletes – that’s what we’re paid to do.“I tried my best but it’s hard to play every game at your highest, highest level. No one can play every single game perfectly. None of these players on this pitch tonight are superhuman and capable of doing that.”England travel to Nice for the third‑place play-off on Saturday and the drive is still there. “We want to win every single game and that doesn’t change now,” Bronze said.The match is likely to be the last World Cup involvement for a number of England’s squad, including the goalkeepers Carly Telford and Karen Bardsley, the midfielders Jill Scott and Karen Carney and the forward Jodie Taylor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f96fe2a5efa05c220605da46d3675e9d006c94ca/126_168_4191_2515/master/4191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd264d6cd5ca7a2c4b46e881bc19b275","title":"frank lampard unveiled new chelsea manager thursday","story":"Frank Lampard was at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night to complete the formalities of his emotional return to Chelsea with the club set to confirm the appointment of their record goalscorer as Maurizio Sarri’s successor as head coach on Thursday.The former England midfielder was pictured arriving back at the stadium where he spent 13 glittering years as a player before signing a three-year deal worth around £4m a season and to conduct interviews with in-house media confirming his return. Derby County, whom Lampard took to the Championship play-off final in his solitary campaign in charge, are understood to have received in excess of £4m in compensation for their manager, who will be joined back in south-west London by his assistant, Jody Morris, and fitness coach, Chris Jones.Chelsea, who lost Sarri to Juventus last month after a difficult year in charge, had been granted permission to open talks with their preferred target last week, with the Derby owner, Mel Morris, putting the subsequent delay in completing a deal down to the 41-year-old having been on holiday. Lampard is believed to have received assurances from the owner, Roman Abramovich, in the period since that he will be given time to make a proper mark back at the club with Chelsea currently operating under a transfer embargo which will potentially extend through to the summer of 2020.That will severely restrict the club’s ambitions in the market – they have secured Christian Pulisic and Mateo Kovacic already this summer, having lost Eden Hazard to Real Madrid, and have a number of loanees who have returned – though Lampard has already expressed an eagerness to tap into the potential of the club’s youth-team set-up to bolster his options. His appointment is likely to be swiftly pursued by confirmation that Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi have signed new five-year deals at the club.As well as roles for Morris and Jones, Lampard is expected to promote the highly regarded Joe Edwards, who has been working in the academy and under-23 set-up, and Eddie Newton to his backroom staff. The latter has more recently overseen the progress of the club’s battalion of loan players.The finer details of Lampard’s arrival were being scrutinised by lawyers at Stamford Bridge on Wednesdaynight but the new head coach is expected to face the media for the first time as Chelsea’s head coach on Thursday. He will take the skeleton squad who have already reported back for pre-season to Dublin on Friday, with his first game in charge to be Wednesday’s friendly against Bohemians at Dalymount Park, before a second fixture against St Patrick’s Athletic three days later.A squad further reinforced by first-team players returning after extended summer breaks will then travel to Japan for subsequent games against Kawasaki Frontale and Barcelona before the end of the month. His first Premier League game in charge will be at Manchester United before Chelsea, as Europa League winners, compete in the European Super Cup against Liverpool in Istanbul.Derby are expected to confirm the former Netherlands international Phillip Cocu as Lampard’s successor at Pride Park. The 48-year-old made an impressive transition from player to manager during his time in charge of PSV Eindhoven, and is a free agent after leaving the Turkish club, Fenerbahce, last October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ca8ccd84daf1ed7bb55005e6fdc33465ece2f8/126_235_2588_1553/master/2588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=004fb4d91791245645fdfa92fee3beff","title":"netherlands sweden womens world cup semi final match report","story":"New Manchester United signing Jackie Groenen ensured the Netherlands finally got the better of an excellent Hedvig Lindahl in the Swedish goal, in extra time, to set up a final between the reigning world champions, the USA, and the European champions.“Well I just saw a nice angle and we’ve been discussing it for a few weeks now about me taking more shots,” said Groenen. ”The ball came nicely and I thought I should just do it.”“I wasn’t emotional at all after this game to be honest,” said Netherlands manager Sarina Wiegman. “It might come later. I don’t think it has sunk in yet.”A dull 90 minutes, perhaps the dullest of the tournament, saw a grey game under a grey sky stumble towards extra time scoreless.Neither the Netherlands nor Sweden had looked likely to make the breakthrough in Lyon, instead the former Chelsea and Arsenal goalkeepers Lindahl and Sari Van Veenendaal, both let go by their WSL sides, were arguably the stars and firmly in the shop window. But in the 99th minute Groenen, whose form had been a concern going into the World Cup, beat Lindahl from 20 yards with a low strike.The crowd were underwhelmed in the first half - the allegedly sold out stadium so patchy you could make out the ‘Olympique Lyonnaise’ in white seats across the top tier - and the play mirrored the lacklustre support. It was two evenly matched teams playing it safe.Lina Hunting came in for the suspended Fridolina Rolfo and Elin Rubensson remained in her starting position due to a late injury to Nathalie Bjorn in the warm-up, while a struggling Shanice van de Sanden was benched in favour of 22-year-old Bayern Munich forward Lineth Beerensteyn.Changes were minimal, contrasting heavily with the tactical chess from Phil Neville and Jill Ellis on Tuesday night. With the Dutch unable to carry out their usual orange march to the stadium, officials ruling out the 12-mile route from the centre on health and safety grounds, this was not the buzzing home-away-from-home that the Netherlands players had become a little accustomed to in the north.Sweden’s first chance fell to Stina Blackstenius, who scored against Canada and Germany on the way to Lyon, Sofia Jakobsson slipped a neat pass to the Linkopings forward overlapping on the right but her shot was hesitant and straight at Sari Van Veenendaal.A Dominique Bloodworth corner though, found the Dutch record goalscorer towards the far post but her powerful header was expertly nudged by the fingertips of Lindahl onto the bar.Van de Sanden received a raucous welcome when ushered into the fray with less than 20 minutes to play. And she immediately burst into life flying towards the Swedish box before earning a corner and thrusting her arms up and down trying to inspire some life into the limp match.In extra time though, it was Groenen that would prove the difference.The midfielder, who has grown into this tournament, darted towards the box and picked the ball up at the end of a nicely passing move before powering low past Lindahl.“The feeling? Well, what can I say? A feeling of emptiness really,” said Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson. “Everyone who has experienced it knows it. You’re not angry, you’re not sad, you’re not disappointed. Empty, that’s what I feel like right now.”The Netherlands meet the USA back in this stadium on Sunday afternoon, while Sweden, who beat England 2-0 in November, meet the Lionesses in the third place play-off on Saturday in Nice.‚“It’s about a medal and third is better than fourth so we’ll do everything to win it. It’s not a lot of time and we have to see if players who have played 120 minutes can play,” said Gerhardsson.

It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

Carillo’s cross found Yoshimar Yotun, who controlled the ball on his chest before volleying home into the unguarded net.Chile were much better in the second half but their attempts at goal were either off target or safely handled by Pedro Gallese in the Peruvian net. Captain Paolo Guerrero capped the scoring in stoppage time before Gallese ended his perfect night by saving a dinked penalty from Eduardo Vargas.“Peru played well, they deserve to be in the final,” said Chilean midfielder Gary Medel. “That hurts as we wanted to win another title. We had chances in the second half but we couldn’t convert them.”Peru will play Brazil in the final at Rio de Janeiro’s Maracana stadium on Sunday.Guerrero said they had put the 5-0 group stage rout behind them and would now start planning how to win their first Copa América since 1975.“I think we all played well, we all made sacrifices,” he said. “We were very intense and we deserve to be in the final. Now we need to rest and think of Brazil.

We were already shocked by the situation in other villages. Health workers spoke to us of the difficulties since the outbreak of violence in that part of DRC, not only in providing routine preventive healthcare such as immunisations and safe deliveries of newborns, but also in treating current measles cases, or common illnesses such as malaria, pneumonia and gastroenteritis.Local health workers were unable to provide appropriate care due to lack of medications their pharmacies were empty, with many essential items out of stock for months. They spoke of people fleeing burned villages to live in makeshift huts, exposed to the elements with no food or healthcare. They described how armed groups had even stolen the primary hospital’s solar panels, cutting off power to the cold-chain fridges and thus crippling its ability to store vaccines.Despite all this, we weren’t expecting the number of cases we saw that day in Mayi Munene. We found people waiting for us under an outdoor shelter that replaced the destroyed health centre. Together with the local nurses we set up a makeshift clinic using a few plastic tables and chairs and the consultations began.By this time, the crowd waiting had doubled, then tripled, and before we knew it there was a huge crowd of desperate parents jostling to get in line to seek assistance for their unwell children. Within the first few hours we saw 70 patients, of whom 68 undoubtedly had measles. More than 30 had severe complications including pneumonia, malnutrition, malaria and dehydration.To put this into context: I’ve been working as a doctor in Australia for 13 years, and until seeing my first case in a Perth emergency department a few years ago (when we saw a resurgence of measles in Australia due to returned travellers and an increase in the anti-vaccination movement) I had only seen measles in textbooks. So, when I saw the burden of this very infectious, deadly and yet preventable disease – hundreds of cases within a single day in a single village – it was shocking. No child should die of measles in this day and age.Almost all the children we saw were under the age of five. I will never forget a grandmother who arrived holding a severely malnourished and dehydrated baby. The baby’s skin was peeling, and she was barely breathing. Her mother was behind her in line holding her older child who was looking very unwell. The look of pain I saw in these women’s eyes will forever be etched in my memory. We did the best we could, but sadly despite emergency resuscitation it was too late – the baby died within the hour.In an emergency assessment phase we don’t have all the resources to stay behind at each village. Although we had given training and support to the local staff, and had left boxes of medications, we felt a huge pit in our stomachs. Judging by the overwhelming crowd of patients still waiting, we knew the medications would likely run out after only a few hours.Even the patients’ families must have known, as when we bid goodbye to our local colleagues, several mothers came over to us crying, tugging on my clothes, and even trying to stop the car from driving away – pleading with us to stay and send word for more urgent help. It was a silent and sombre drive back to the camp as four experienced field workers: a driver, a logistics manager, a nurse and doctor were moved to tears knowing what we left behind. We had reached a new low.Our aim was to visit the villages worst affected by measles, take blood samples and confirm the diagnosis, and then provide treatment. The diagnoses would allow the official confirmation of a measles epidemic in the region, which would in turn allow a coordinated epidemic response.We also trained local health staff on how to best manage complicated measles cases deliver much-needed medical supplies and collect information on rates of infection and malnutrition which often is one of the many life-threatening consequences of measles. MSF teams would then be able to deliver vaccines and set up emergency field hospitals and clinics to take care of complicated cases.In the DRC, however, access to lifesaving measles vaccines is significantly limited. Now they are in the throes of a huge measles epidemic. This year, more than 1,500 measles-related deaths have been officially recorded in DRC. At the time of writing, MSF teams had vaccinated 361,079 children there.No child should die of measles, whether in Australia, the DRC or elsewhere. Yet many people have no idea what a luxury access to free immunisations is. I am pleading with parents to never take that for granted. You cannot imagine what it’s like to see the conditions we see in the field.Start at home: vaccinate your children. And support firm policies on climate change, the environment and the eradication of extreme poverty that work to make health global for all, and not just another privilege of western society. Healthcare is a human right, but tragically so many people are deprived of this basic need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62beaf9c1a5fd8c256ddb59246b9dda8f839f83b/0_297_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e227d7c5a22d04b73ad854ad3aea73","title":"were you and your partner married by a loved one in an unofficial ceremony","story":"Who did you choose to conduct your ceremony and why?

The 3D imagery made you feel as if you were part of it. Light and dark moments in the music and the show took you through a waterfall of emotions, while the beat keept you in ecstasy. A truly unforgettable show, perhaps the best I have seen at Glastonbury. Satya, 26, GloucesterI was really nervous about going to Glastonbury because I’d never been to a festival before – I was there with my parents to celebrate my forthcoming 18th birthday. We waited at the Pyramid stage all day on Friday to see Stormzy, and saw some amazing performances from Bastille and George Ezra. We’re used to watching the headliners on TV so it was quite surreal!I’d decided I wanted to be near to the front for Stormzy but I never thought I’d be so close. His set was absolutely incredible, and all of his singers and dancers were amazing. The highlight of the night – and the whole festival – was when Chris Martin came on for Blinded By Your Grace. It was unforgettable, and I felt like I’d had a real “Glastonbury moment”. Seeing two such different musicians come together really showed me just how amazing the festival is. Megan, 17, LiverpoolAn old litter-picking volunteer with a white beard, dreadlocks and a Lancashire accent, who introduced himself only as “that guy”, did a short set at the open-mic in Strummerville on Saturday afternoon. He had a drum machine and a bass guitar, with which he played some remarkably funky tunes, before adding his own unexpectedly brilliant vocals, most notably in a song I assume was called Put It in the Bin Please, in which he pleaded with the audience in increasingly irate tones to correctly dispose of their rubbish. We’d only gone up there for a snooze in the shade of the trees but came away with a proper Glasto highlight. Russell Carswell, 32, LondonJeff Goldblum’s soundcheck!

We’ve seen them several times, including last year at TRNSMT, so I was initially a little underwhelmed when I saw the lineup … But it was their best performance by far, they put so much effort into it and it was flawless.Being our first Glasto with the kids we were fully prepared for meltdowns, but the children (Holly, eight, and Charlie, five) threw themselves into it and didn’t complain once, despite the heat and all the walking. Seeing them dancing their wee socks off at sunset to Liam Gallagher and the Killers made for such beautiful moments.The Kidzfield is a paradise, they got a photo with lovely Dynamo, who completely captured their imaginations! They spent hours doing arts and crafts, going potholing, playing in forts, and getting decorated with rainbows and glitter. They were really on board with the green focus at this year’s festival, even though they are very young, they recognise the importance. Edwina McNulty, GlasgowSeeing Michael Eavis singing Elvis songs on the Avalon Cafe stage was probably the sweetest moment of Glastonbury. In a relatively intimate setting was the man who made this all happen, singing his heart out at the age of 83 and clearly loving every minute of it. It only got better when Emily joined him for a duet of Something Stupid. Neither have particularly brilliant voices but the music world owes them everything. An utterly charming moment. Simon Donohue, 47, ManchesterThe Acoustic Brass Off on the Truth Stage on Thursday night was an absolute blast, with lots of catchy covers and a great atmosphere. Dat Brass began on stage, belting out Cry Me a River and several other tunes. They then waded into the crowd, where they joined forces with the New York Brass Band for some more fun, playing Thrift Shop and Get Lucky. Double sousaphone equals double fun! Matt, 29, LondonFrank Turner on the Avalon Stage on Friday night. I’d not seen him live before but the energy and desire to put on a great show were incredible. Jonny Ford, 50, LiverpoolThis is about my 25th Glastonbury and the highlight this year was wandering around with my 13-year-old daughter, Cliodhna, on Sunday night. We went to the top of the Ribbon Tower in the Park, which I’d never done before. It’s just fantastic. The whole of gorgeous Glastonbury is laid out before you, a million lights twinkling. All three of my kids have been coming since they were little. We all love it and I hope we’re all there next year at the 50th Glastonbury, as I’ll be 50 too. Jane O’Hara, 49, CharlseworthMy friends and I agonised over whether to see her or the Cure. Halfway through the first song I knew we’d made the right choice. She is the Glasto performer that 2019 deserves: singing and talking about being an outsider, acceptance, joy, sexuality, confusion. She dazzled with on-point choreography, confidence and pitchperfect delivery. It was theatre, dance and music – a real show, a triumph. It helps that she’s very funny, exudes warmth and can build a rapid rapport with the crowd with her slightly off-kilter English. It was a shame so comparatively few people were there to see it. But it gave the show an intimate feel and even a little space to dance. Andy McGrath, 30, StreathamIt was the first time I’ve seen the Cure live – WOW! An amazing performance from a band who showed you really don’t need the bunting and the special guests, just a huge catalogue of amazing songs performed brilliantly by superb musicians and a singer with Robert Smith’s ability to mesmerise. solarevolutionWatching Jorja Smith with my 14-year-old daughter, her eyes filled with happy tears as she looked across at me and mouthed: “This is the happiest I’ve ever been.” In front of us were five 21-year-olds from south Wales at their first Glastonbury. They too were teary, hugging us and telling us how much they wanted to bring their daughters to Glastonbury when they were older, saying how wonderful it was to make such special memories. I’d stewarded that day between 3am and 10am and was knackered! But as the sun (finally) began to dip beneath the horizon the world stopped just for a moment and it was the most beautiful place in the world.

However, it was unclear whether he would match Hunt’s policy commitment.His opponent’s move will be seen as an attempt to attract votes from Tory members in rural areas as ballot papers for the Conservative leadership contest begin to be sent to the party membership.It comes after Theresa May reportedly forced a free vote pledge on the issue into the party’s 2017 manifesto, telling a campaign event she has “always been in favour of foxhunting”. However, she eventually dropped the plan after the Conservatives lost their majority in the general election, having recognised there was a “clear message” against it from the public.Conversely, the Labour party pledged last year to strengthen the Hunting Act in government and abolish legal loopholes that campaigners say enable the sport to effectively continue under the pretence of trail hunting.On Wednesday evening the Labour party chairman, Ian Lavery, said: “This Tory leadership race is going from bad to worse. We’ve had Johnson’s tax cuts for the wealthy, a race to the bottom on no-deal Brexit, and now a pledge to bring back this barbaric practice that Labour had proudly banned.”Hunt also said in an article for the  that he was better placed than his rival to win an election against Labour, claiming its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, regarded Britain as “a force for evil in the world” and was the “most anti-British leader this country has ever seen”.He used the article to promise to give his rival Johnson a “very important cabinet job” if he prevails in the Conservative party’s leadership election, in an apparent effort to unite the party. He went on to say MPs might have to cancel their summer holidays in order to pass laws that would allow the UK to leave the European Union without a deal in October, if he became prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

And whatever it is, can we have some more please? Preferably in large doses by the middle of next week.On a lovely soft summer day in Chester-le-Street England’s opening pair were once again the difference. At 10 o’clock Eoin Morgan had won the toss and chosen to bat. From there it took just 18 overs of regal, muscular violence against the hard white ball from Bairstow and Jason Roy to all-but decide this de facto World Cup quarter-final before the scoreboard clock had passed midday.Just like the previous time England played the most important ODI in their modern history – also known as last Sunday – it was Bairstow who seized the moment and wrenched it his way, scoring a second brilliant hundred to set up a 119-run victory.He did so with feeling. But then this is a man who does everything with feeling, for whom there is no sense of breaking point being reached, because every point is breaking point. Often with elite sports people success is a moment of fulfilment or beatific peace. For Bairstow success comes as a kind of rage, those sublime achievements born out of galvanising adversity, real or imagined.As he reached his hundred at the Riverside, a brutally carefree innings from 95 balls, Bairstow did not smile or cheer or look bashful. He shouted and flexed his neck muscles, looking not so much overjoyed as vengeful.Possibly this was motivated by the former England captain Michael Vaughan. A minor spat between the two had bubbled away in the build-up. Here, at a moment to be enthroned in his personal highlights reel years from now, to crown his rise as arguably England’s finest ODI batsman ever, Bairstow chose to rub the top of his head in celebration. Vaughan is known for his work advertising a wig-maker’s franchise. Whatever it takes to get you through the moments.New Zealand were hindered at the start of play by the absence of the rakish Lockie Ferguson, either suffering from a hamstring injury or piloting a twin-propeller plane to save a sacred Inca statue from the Nazis, depending on whom you believed.The left-arm spinner Mitch Santner took the new ball, a tactic designed specifically to play on the batsmen’s nerves. The only problem being, Bairstow and Roy have no nerves. Santner was carted to the fence and England were off.Tim Southee replaced him and was clubbed hungrily over cover by Bairstow. It had to be Southee here. The cycle of this England team demanded it. It is four years and four months since Southee provided the definitive full-stop on England Mk1, his seven for 33 in Wellington at the last World Cup crystallising the sense of a team that found in the white ball nothing but fear and pain.Bairstow did not play in that game. He had made his ODI debut four years earlier, played six games and never got past 41. He came back post-Southee, at the end of that first heady summer of McCullum in 2015. Since when it has been more or less as it was here.England had made 44 after five overs. Bairstow’s own high-grade fifty came up with nine fours from 46 balls. He waved his bat pointedly to the dressing room, once again silencing the media critics (who all like him). The 100 partnership arrived in the 15th over, bowled by the mournful Colin De Grandhomme. Some bowlers bound to the wicket as though approaching some vital point of destiny. With De Grandhomme every day is the retreat from Moscow.New Zealand bowled too short or too full or too slowly. Bairstow ran like a maniac or stood still to hit with stunning power. At 176 for one in the 28th over he waited, let the tension leave his shoulders and lofted Southee over mid-off for a six on to the black tarpaulins to move to ninety.Next over Southee sent down, perhaps the worst ball Bairstow will receive at this World Cup, a 75mph slower ball half-tracker. Two balls later he topped it with a floaty hip-high full toss. Bairstow steered both through square-leg to reach three figures.He took off his helmet, rubbed his hair and took in the warm swell of applause around the Riverside stands. There is a violent kind of beauty in Bairstow’s batting when he plays like this, not so much arrogance or swagger as a physical assurance given only to the most natural of athletes.Perhaps that multi-hatted cricketing existence has also disguised the through-the-roof brilliance of his ODI batting. Since May 2017 Bairstow has scored 2,277 runs at 54 with nine hundreds. No other England ODI batsman averages over 45 with a strike rate above 100. Twice in five days he has won defining generational games for his country. The argument as to whether Bairstow is England’s finest could simply start with the question: who has been better?Just maybe don’t tell him yet. The rest of the order scrabbled a little to reach 307. Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer once again knocked the top off the chase. Chester-le-Street cooked gently in the late afternoon sun, with a wonderful feeling of space and light around those low stands. England will travel from here to Edgbaston next Thursday, still hitting from the front, still led by their own oddly spiky white-ball giant and two steps now from a kind of cricketing heaven."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51f09ae0f56819815d686739dec01c149b0d4613/437_774_7149_4290/master/7149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d388211c60fe258db6535955a8b80982","title":"katherine ryan interview comedy single mum glitter room","story":"The queen of the caustic punchline talks about plastic surgery, embarrassing her daughter – and turning her life as a single mum into a sitcomKatherine Ryan is busily scrolling through a neighbourhood Facebook group when we meet. “Someone’s dog attacked another dog today which was sad,” she says, “but mostly people are just selling things.” However, her days in north London might be numbered. “I’m just ready to be a bit country,” she explains. Back in 2007, when she arrived in the UK, Ryan headed straight for Crouch End, where a gaggle of fellow Canadian comics had already settled down, and where she now spends her days mooching around in a velour Juicy Couture tracksuit she bought when Paris Hilton was at her peak.But the 35-year-old is now ready for a change. Her itchy feet are particularly understandable when you consider just how much has happened in the last 12 years. Previously a staff trainer for the Hooters restaurant chain in Canada, Ryan arrived in London with her then boyfriend, didn’t think she’d stay long and flitted between London and her tiny home town of Sarnia, Ontario. Her comedy career was in its infancy (“I was definitely doing an impression of Sarah Silverman”) but watching the likes of Sara Pascoe made her fall for London’s standup scene, and put down roots in the city. She worked a 9 to 5 job, had a daughter, Violet – who is now 10 – and became a single mum when her relationship with Violet’s father ended. “I didn’t even have a phone when she was born. A poor mum is a good mum,” she deadpans.However, Ryan was also slowly ascending from open mic nights to panel shows such as 8 Out of 10 Cats and on to her current position as Gen Y’s answer to Joan Rivers. She’s best known for caustic punchlines verging on the unsayable, and gigs on programmes like (the fairly mean-spirited) Your Face Or Mine?, where couples have to decide whether they’re more attractive than one another. In a meta twist, she also presented the UK reboot of Rivers’ gilded doc series How’d You Get So Rich? Ryan once quipped that the late comic “got exactly what she wanted from that final surgery – to stop ageing”.We are snatching an hour at the Ace hotel in London amid Ryan’s busy schedule, ostensibly to talk about her new Netflix special, Glitter Room, but Ryan is soon giving her opinion about everything from Cardi B (“She’s just like, yeah I was a stripper – I love the fact that she’s so open”) to her tiny, “unethical” teacup dogs. She’s got an animal rights event lined up straight after, and is a big fan of the kind of canines her mate Danny Dyer describes as “dogs that shiver and piss from their eyes”.Ryan is warm, lightly cynical, and a bit of a magpie – she marvels at our waitress’s luminescent makeup, and is herself dressed in a diamanté-studded denim jacket and black tutu with big, Lady Gaga-esque sunglasses by her side. She is unusually interested in the harried freelancers hunched over their laptops in the hotel lobby, a situation she can relate to as well as the Netflix special – her second, following 2017’s In Trouble – she’s currently writing a sitcom for the streaming service. The Duchess, a “heightened version” of her life, will, she says, offer something a bit different from the sadcoms that have dominated TV in recent years. “My character is a bit of a fish out of water – she’s this brash, disruptive, North American mother who doesn’t act like you would think a mother would act. And she’s happy about being a mum! I don’t feel like it’s a drag. I think you can still be taken seriously, you can still be fashionable, you can still have fun,” she says, before pausing. “Do you think we should sadden it up a bit?”However, even if the tears are few, there’s a realism that’s never far from the surface with Ryan’s work. In both her sitcom and Glitter Room – previously seen on tour and in the West End – her hyperbolic, cutting gags often centre on motherhood, and single motherhood in particular. “The Glitter Room is Violet’s bedroom,” Ryan explains. The show is “about how proud I felt when I bought us our first property ever, a tiny flat. We decorated it to be really feminine, yet still in 2018 builders would notice that I was alone and be like, ‘That’s so sad, where’s the man?’ Or ‘You don’t want all those flowers – no man will want to live here.’”In her own experience, there’s still a sense of judgment around single motherhood, even within showbusiness, where she says she’s constantly asked, “Who’s watching your daughter?”, or “How have you explained your dirty mouth to her?”“Single dads are like sexy heroes,” she says, a subject she expands on live. “But if you’re a single mum there’s still a stigma.”The special was filmed in LA, where Ryan is less known than in the UK. “It really felt like proving myself, like you would do at an open mic or a comedy club,” she says. “But I think that’s always the way it should be. I’ve seen shows where you can tell people have been laughing at a comedian’s jokes for a while and they shouldn’t have been. I think you always want to be able to show up and be treated really fairly – ruthlessly even – by an audience and that’s the only way you’re going to know if you’re really funny or not”.Ryan compares having been a single mum to being in the Brie Larson hostage film Room, “except at least in the film the mum had someone bringing her groceries”. While she and Violet are supremely close, Ryan is also careful to give her daughter as much privacy as possible, and refrains from posting pictures of her online.Meanwhile, there is a chance Ryan may move home – and that wouldn’t be the only change in her life right now. While filming the upcoming series of Who Do You Think You Are? back in Canada (“I was just like, please do not let my ancestors have slaughtered the indigenous population, please!”), she ran into her high school sweetheart, Bobby, whom she hadn’t seen in 20 years. “I genuinely have always loved him, always,” she says. “I don’t know if that’s the nostalgia of your first love and being 16, but he walked in and I was like, wow. Then I just slept with him for an anecdote. I thought, he’ll go back to his friends and tell them and have a laugh, I’ll tell my friends, they’ll have a laugh, but no, I just really liked him.” She pauses, before adding a pained “Uh oh!”Bobby’s still in Canada so they’re taking things slowly. However, Ryan feels conflicted about the whole thing given her current projects. “It’s annoying because I have the special coming out where I’m going, right I’m not going to have a boyfriend again until I’m in my 60s. I also don’t want to abandon people. I’ve spent all this time talking to women who feel there is this culture that’s like, ‘She has all these cats and she says she doesn’t want a boyfriend but she’s lying, she’s incomplete.’ I hate that, because I felt very happy and very complete.”In any case, she isn’t about to start extolling the virtues of being coupled up. “Men are like dolphins – best enjoyed on holiday,” she quips in Glitter Room, and she’s still keeping Bobby “under review” she says. “I’m like, whatever happens, I don’t want to be in love, I don’t want to be in a relationship and I don’t want to get married.” Then she bursts out laughing and flashes a sardonic smile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30f981393bfb53e871be0766c9a3ad0c2965aad/0_0_4990_2994/master/4990.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e1f5bbbf4b2cbc2f2c887818780f2c","title":"instagram whatsapp facebook media files outage","story":"Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp were malfunctioning throughout most of the day on Wednesday and into the night.

You can pick up a Nokia 105 (2017 edition) for about £15 or a dual-sim Nokia 106 (2018 edition) for about £16. These are only 2G phones but they have built-in FM radios, they can send texts, they are great for making phone calls and they are not based on Google or Apple technologies. A 3G or 4G phone would cost a bit more …This answers your question but it is obviously not the solution you are looking for …The problem is that most people – including me – want to use Googly things on their phones. Gmail is the dominant email service, YouTube is the dominant short video provider, Google Search and Google Maps are very useful and Google Chrome is the most widely used web browser. There may be viable and sometimes preferable alternatives but you have to make an effort to use them. Most people don’t want to make the effort.Indeed, it looks as though the next generation of candy-bar phones will also include Google. Nokia’s latest 4G feature-phone, the Nokia 8110 “banana phone”, runs the KaiOS operating system, in which Google has invested $22 million. The Alcatel Go Flip 2, JioPhone and Orange Sanza are alternative KaiOS phones available in North America, India and Africa respectively. (Kai is named from the Chinese word for open, not the undead protagonist in the Lexx science fiction series.)KaiOS includes WhatsApp – its main selling point – plus a web browser, Facebook, YouTube, Google Maps and Google Assistant. It’s claimed to be the second most popular operating system in India and could manage that in Africa. Some KaiOS phones cost less than $20.KaiOS started as a fork of B2G (Boot to Gecko), which was an open source continuation of Firefox OS, which Mozilla stopped developing at the end of 2015. Gonk, the operating system underneath Gecko (which is Firefox’s web-rendering engine) is a small Linux kernel derived from Google’s AOSP, the Android Open Source Project.The fact that we have, essentially, a duopoly in the smartphone business is not for want of trying. Microsoft entered the market with a version of Windows running on ARM-based smartphones and it even made Windows available free on small-screen devices. The people who owned Windows phones seemed to love them and in 24 countries it overtook Apple’s iPhone in market share. However, the lack of apps was a major stumbling block and Microsoft abandoned its challenge, having lost billions of dollars in the attempt.You can still buy Windows phones but most date from 2015-16 and will soon be out of support. I didn’t recommend buying them when they came out so I really wouldn’t recommend one now.Canonical also had a go at the smartphone market with its Linux-based Ubuntu Touch. It failed. In this case, the development was taken over by the UBports Community, which developed a port for the OnePlus One smartphone in 2015. There are now a few others but I don’t expect Ubuntu Touch phones to appear in your local high street.South Korea’s two smartphone manufacturers, Samsung and LG, would also love to have an independent operating system but success is unlikely. Samsung tried with Tizen, which was supported by the Linux Foundation. The Samsung Z series was launched in India and didn’t do well enough but Tizen is used in Samsung Gear smartwatches. LG could have a go with Palm’s Linux-based webOS, which it acquired from HP in 2013. WebOS first appeared on Palm Pre smartphones in 2009 but LG has mainly used it in smart TV sets.Sailfish started with another failed Linux project, Nokia and Intel’s MeeGo. The latest version uses a graphical shell from Jolla, the Finnish company that appears to be its major backer. Sailfish can be ported to more alternative smartphones than Ubuntu Touch but I can’t see any current phones with Sailfish pre-installed. The same is true for both e (formerly Eelo), which is a sort of de-Googled Android, and LineageOS, which is a reborn CyanogenMod.You main hope is Purism’s forthcoming Librem 5, which seems to be exactly what you want. Whether it can buck the trend remains to be seen.In general, the problem with Linux on smartphones looks much like its problem on PCs. Many and various groups enjoy developing new versions of the operating system, which are all more or less doomed from birth. None of them have the skills, the interests or the money to create viable platforms that include the hardware, apps, services, packaging, marketing, advertising, distribution and support on the sort of scale needed to sustain a real product. Without those, they are unlikely to attract much interest beyond hobbyists and enthusiasts.Things may change thanks mainly to the current American president. Trump sent China and the rest of the world a wakeup call by trying to exclude Huawei – the world’s second-largest smartphone manufacturer and the leader in 5G – from using American technology. Huawei was already developing its own Android app-compatible operating system, currently known as Hongmen OS, as an alternative. The potential loss of up to $30bn in sales per year suggests there will be no shortage of money or manpower for its future development.Indeed, China has a powerful incentive to replace all the American technology it uses with home-grown alternatives. This may take decades but in the long run, it will hurt Google, Intel, Qualcomm and numerous other US companies. The genie is out of the bottle and the Americans will never be able to put it back.Hongmen, aka Ark OS, may not have a lot of appeal in Europe but it could do well in Asian countries that already do more trade with China than with the US.Meanwhile, the EU’s latest antitrust case against Google should allow phone manufacturers to offer alternative browsers and search engines. It should also enable Android smartphone suppliers to sell phones with alternative versions of Android in Europe, which Google did not allow them to do before. A major player such as Samsung or Huawei could therefore test the market with a Google-free Android phone. In which case, you can vote with your wallet.A recent Washington Post story based on Disconnect.me technology found trackers were rife in the journalist’s iPhone apps. Google, of course, banned Disconnect Mobile from its Play store way back in 2014. In a blogpost, the company wrote: “Google refuses to explain their decision, other than to say that our app won’t be allowed if it interferes with any ads even ads that contain malware and steal your identity.”The app economy, like the web economy, is ultimately based on surveillance. That isn’t likely to change unless the EU does something about it. And so far, despite the GDPR and three antitrust cases against Google, the EU has left smartphone tracking revenues unharmed.Have you got a question?

She is on the Board of Trustees for Marlens, the charity that looks after the Marine Lake and a member of the South West Seals winter swimmers.“Not renowned for its swimming, the Somerset coastline is characteristically brown and turgid. Clevedon has a historic bathing tradition – the famous Long Swim is now in its 91st year – while Clevedon Marine Lake has just marked its 90th birthday. Swimming from Clevedon beach feels like being part of the town’s fabric. You can only swim here around high tide but the joy of this small window is that all of Clevedon’s sea-swimming community comes together. Clevedon has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world, never letting the silty sea bed settle and this makes conditions variable. Depending on conditions and tide, you can swim under the pier’s legs or around its end. You will always come out smiling.”Refuel Survived the silty swim?

Taking The Plunge: The Healing Power of Wild Swimming for Mind, Body and Soul by Anna Deacon and Vicky Allan will be published in November 2019 by Black \u0026amp White Publishing.“I have swum in some extraordinary places but my favourite is closer to home, Gullane. The beach is on a stunning piece of coastline than runs from Edinburgh to the Borders. There are beaches after beaches but Gullane has everything: it stretches on for what seems like miles, there are amazing rockpools, sand dunes to run down, secret caves to explore and, best of all, beautifully clear sea. There have been dolphins spotted and, sometimes, minke whales have made an appearance.”Refuel Seek sustenance in Drift, an old shipping container perched on the headland with a view over to Bass Rock, huge windows and brilliant cakes.You might not know her name but you may have heard about the St Ives Mermaid: Laura Evans. She swims daily, often found leaping off the harbour wall or washed up with her tail at beaches around the Cornish town, delighting children and adults alike.“West Penwith – from Porthmeor Cove to Nanjizal – is my favourite stretch of coastline. The landscape seems to change as you round every headland: from granite formations to lush greenery surrounding old mining ruins. There are secluded coves and tidal pools, meaning you are spoilt for choice when it comes to seeking a swim and more often than not you will have it all to yourself. I love Porth Nanven, also known as Cot valley and Dinosaur Egg Beach it’s named due to the sea turning the granite into ovals.”• Laura has recently founded a new St Ives Swimmers group – why not join them if you’re staying nearby?Refuel After seeking dinosaur eggs, carry on down the South West Coast Path to Sennen Cove and grab a pint at sunset in the Old Success Inn.Jane is a member of the Alnwick Sea Swimmers and swims all seasons in the North Sea off the Northumberland coast. She tries to go daily and often organises longer-distance swims from the Farne Islands or to Holy Island. From the mainland to Holy Island is just under a mile in distance but challenged by strong currents, so Jane organises support for those who wish to swim the stretch.“I am incredibly lucky. The stretch of coastline I swim is mostly in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. White sandy beaches, clean water, wildlife – and mostly free parking! The beaches are often deserted and I often have the company of seals, birds and occasionally dolphins if I’m really lucky. Among my favourites is Football Hole, one of Northumberland’s secrets. It is a bit of a walk but no one else is ever there. I mostly swim parallel to shore but, when the tides permit, I swim down the River Aln.

Anthony joins at least every other weekend, and all year around.“Tankerton offers grassy banks full of beach huts, which make it one of the most attractive places to look back to from the sea. At high tide, the water is a good swimming depth without being too far from the shore. At low tide, the sea goes a long way out and you can walk out to a Tudor shipwreck or along The Street – a shingle spit that stretches far into the sea. If it’s rough then you know it is and when it’s calm, as it often is, then it doesn’t throw any surprises at you. There is a current to swim against but it pulls you along the beach rather than out to sea. This means you can swim with it, at speed, or challenge yourself against it, which makes it all the more fun!”Refuel After swimming against the current, have breakfast at the Seaview Café. It opens early on a Sunday and it is right on the seafront.Colin has recently become the first man (the first person was a woman) to swim a solo crossing of the Big Minch, the sea between the Outer Hebrides and Scottish mainland. He runs the Hebridean Sea Swimmers group and swims in the sea two to three times a week.“My favourite place to swim on the Isle of Lewis is Giordail beach in the village of Tolsta. It has a host of different formations along the coast, including the old pier and a waterfall. There’s also sea stacks to swim around, a natural arch and a tunnel to swim through – although you really need a local swim guide to show you how to find them safely, as the coastline is rugged with not many exit points.”Refuel Take your own hot drink but stop off at the Blackhouse Bakery for freshly made and tasty bakes.

She used to swim daily but now swims as much as possible since becoming a mother.“Southwold is my favourite beach by far as this is now my home and has been for the past four years. As soon as I moved here I was swimming most days along the beach. Eventually, I was joined by other swimmers and Suzie’s Beach Café became our HQ. It’s fabulous swimming to the pier, looking back at the town in all kinds of weather conditions, measuring our distance by the number of groynes or crow’s nests we have swum past.”Refuel Made it to the pier?

It is in the heart of the Glens of Antrim and is a quiet spot with the sounds of sheep and the lapping of waves.

They meet every Wednesday and Sunday and often take new recruits out to introduce them to the joy of the sea.“Lligwy is shallow shelving with golden sand and is usually sheltered from the typical south westerly-prevailing wind. Although, if a northerly system blows through it can get rather bouncy, creating waves to play in. We frequently swim with inquisitive seals – there is a colony of Atlantic greys on a rocky outcrop a mile or so from the beach. We swim along the shoreline often in clear, blue water.

In April, a  article argued that while Fleabag is “a work of undeniable genius”, those who did not recognise themselves in it were being drowned out.Asked what her reaction was when people describe her as being privileged, Waller-Bridge said it was “absolutely probably true” that many people do not have the same opportunities she did to be able to make “their Fleabag”.But she took umbrage with criticism about the substance of her work as related to her background.“To criticise a story on the basis of where the author had come from, or how privileged the author is, undermines the story,” she told the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day.“I’ve never pretended that I’m not from a privileged position, I really know that I am … I was perfectly set up to have success in the world.“I suppose some of the criticism is that it was ‘just for posh girls’ and what I loved was that people were sending me photos of tweets ... There was one guy saying ‘I’m a disabled 42-year-old man living in Hull and I am Fleabag’. And it was like ‘Yes mate!’ because that’s always what I’m striving for … That people feel like it is a human story.”Waller-Bridge was educated at private schools and descends from titled nobility on both sides of her family. She also attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, one of the most prestigious such institutions in the UK.However, she said she had “really, really worked for it” and that her privilege in itself had not created Fleabag, though she conceded the tale was told through the prism of a middle-class family.“I created Fleabag, but from a point of place in my life where I was able to sit and write, and I was able to take the time, and I was around people who could support that,” said Waller-Bridge, who also wrote Killing Eve.“I like to think that whatever life I’d lived, wherever I’d been born or brought up, I would still have written if I had been given the encouragement, and actually that’s the thing that I care about, encouraging people to do it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c1a14a5a69fdc4db435a9a9cdc873bb63fb39f1/0_24_1196_718/master/1196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75f53b6695a3af4684cf79feecb67bd","title":"ice cream los angeles instagram influencers","story":"Joe Nicchi has had enough of self-proclaimed ‘influencers wanting free cones for publicity. Now he’s the one going viralCustomers at Joe Nicchi’s ice cream truck have increasingly had the same demand: give us your ice cream for free.CVT Soft Serve, a popular truck in Los Angeles, has started to receive weekly requests from self-proclaimed Instagram “influencers” who promise to post a photo of Nicchi’s ice cream – if they don’t have to pay. Nicchi has always said no, but this week he found an unusual way to profit off of the influencers: he publicly told them to go away.Nicchi went viral after posting a sign that said “influencers pay double”, writing on Instagram that he would “never give you a free ice cream in exchange for a post”. The image, tagged #InfluencersAreGross, spread around the globe, and now Nicchi says his business is booming, attracting fans across southern California who share his disdain of influencers.“We’re the anti-influencer influencers,” he told the  on Wednesday. “It’s weird … but I think it’s really fun. I hope it inspires small businesses to hold their own and tell people to fuck off.”Some brands and businesses now rely on Instagram “stars” to advertise their products and services, giving away free meals and hotel stays to people who post positively about the experience. The phenomenon has become so pervasive that some Instagrammers can easily scam companies. One Instagram influencer recently staged a “surprise” wedding engagement but had actually sent an itinerary to marketers months prior. It’s so trendy to be an influencer that some people have taken to pretending their content is sponsored when it’s not.Nicchi understands the importance of promotion. He’s a working actor in LA, who started CVT Soft Serve in 2014 as a way to supplement his income.“This is a money-making thing. I can’t give away my ice cream for free,” he said, noting that he had paid for his first truck with salary from shooting a commercial.The soft serve at CVT (which stands for his three flavor offerings: chocolate, vanilla, or twist) and his vintage-looking truck are very Instagrammable. Influencers quickly noticed. In his first year, he got a small handful of influencer offers, typically people emailing suggesting promotional deals in exchange for free ice cream.“They love using the word ‘exposure’. It’s so ridiculous,” he said.But the frequency of the requests began to escalate – and became more uncomfortable as they started happening in person, said Nicchi: “The most painful thing for me is when they approach me at the truck.”It never made sense to him: “Are you out of your mind? This is four dollars. But obviously they wouldn’t be asking if people weren’t saying yes.”At times, the requests were particularly offensive. He said an assistant to a famous actor – a woman on a television show who he declined to name – recently asked if he would donate ice cream to the cast and crew. In exchange, the actor offered to take a photo at his truck.His response: “As much as I’d love to do that, I don’t think my kid’s school accepts celebrity photos as a form of tuition payment.”The assistant responded with a nasty and vaguely threatening message, he said, along the lines of: “I should be careful with my words … This is a very small town.”Nicchi eventually became so tired of influencers that he put up his anti-influencer sign at the truck, making clear that people who requested a free cone would get the opposite – they’d have to pay $8 instead of $4. A customer took a photo and posted it to Reddit, which then went viral.He said he had since gotten interview requests and news coverage from across the world, and he is loving it. The number of customers doubled overnight, and he has earned thousands of new followers on Instagram.“There’s something so redeeming about outing influencers,” he said, adding that many small businesses have written to him thanking him for speaking up. “I hope that more people do not allow likes and comments and followers to hold weight in the business. I want people to go to a restaurant because the food and service is fantastic.”Brittany Hennessy, an author who has written about influencers, said companies with marketing budgets can benefit from working with social media personalities, and that a giveaway can pay off. But a small food truck may not a good fit, she said:“People will try and get anything for free … No real influencer would ask for a four-dollar ice cream.”While Nicchi is happy to promote his own business on social media, he said he didn’t want to depend on the platform: “If Instagram went away tomorrow, our truck would still survive. I don’t know that your ‘influencer’ business would.”Nicchi offered to let the  try his ice cream, under one condition: that the reporter pay for the cone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf74a1796a78482541c69e51a94f55b8e7b998a2/56_83_897_538/master/897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29dde357cca6004cd83ff23d626a1e55","title":"ice us immigration messages raids","story":"In 2017, agents made plans to apprehend more than 8,000 people and described the work as ‘fun’US immigration officials planning countrywide raids targeting thousands of undocumented immigrants wrote cheerful messages about the potential arrests, wishing one another “Happy hunting!”, jokingly calling the initiative “Operation Super Epic Mega”, and saying the work was “fun”, records show.The records, obtained by the immigrant rights groups Mijente and Detention Watch Network, were released the same week that the not-for-profit news organization ProPublica uncovered a secret Facebook group where Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers posted racist, misogynistic and violent content about immigrants and Democratic members of Congress.And their release comes as Donald Trump renewed his threat of fresh Ice raids, after calling off a coordinated action targeting undocumented immigrants across the country in late June.The 2017 raid was ultimately canceled, after plans were leaked to the media. But the email records provide a detailed look at the broad and aggressive way Ice targets communities. The documents also offer insight into the culture of the agency, where some officers seem to talk about deportations in a celebratory, joking and excited manner.“The way that the lists are being created is really terrifying,” Jacinta Gonzalez, a Mijente organizer, told the . “The documents show just how politically motivated these raids are … It also just shows that the emphasis is on numbers and not on safety in any way, shape or form.”Matthew Bourke, an Ice spokesman, said the agency did not have “arrest quotas” and that operations were “not based on competition or meeting a specific threshold”.The emails also included a range of controversial language. In one email, an Ice official said his office was “responsible for 240 targets, which is due on September 12th”, signing off with, “Happy hunting and target building!”An assistant field office director in San Bernardino, California, who was confused about whether the operation was called “Epic” or “Mega”, wrote: “I propose we call it Operation Super Epic Mega sonic.” Someone responded that “they … changed the name to Epic!! It was Trumppped!!” Another email labeled “Fugitive Operations” celebrated the name change, saying, “It’s gonna be EPIC!”One email exchange mocked a news article in the York Daily Record, a local Pennsylvania paper, about educating immigrants on their rights. “I’m sure the 4 people that read ydr, never even got to that story!” an Ice official wrote.Another Ice official seemed enthused about the coming raids, writing in an email, “Here we go!!!!” In a July exchange about the operation and targets, a deputy field office director in Texas told one group, “You guys are crushing it,” and the recipient responded, “Thanks, guys are having fun.”In Austin, an Ice official was enthusiastic about detentions, saying, “We had more apprehensions today than any other day during this operation. Awesome job!!”In one August planning email, an official asked another person if they would like to be on an “arrest team” and the person responded: “YOU KNOW IT!!!!!!”Combined with the recent report on the offensive CBP Facebook group, the new Ice records suggested systemic problems among the different agencies involved in immigration enforcement, said Gonzalez: “They have a department-wide problem … They frequently say inhumane and offensive things that are meant to dehumanize.”Bourke, the Ice spokesman, said in an email that the agency “does not condone the use of offensive or politically-charged language in reference to agency enforcement operations”, adding that “any employee found to have acted in a manner that negatively portrays the agency … or embarrasses the agency … will be held accountable and may be subject to disciplinary measures”.He said officers were “expected to conduct enforcement humanely, respectfully and with professionalism”, adding: “ICE operations are driven by the agency’s mission to enforce the nation’s immigration laws and to uphold national security, border security and public safety.”The records also included an Ice presentation about immigrants’ constitutional rights, which Gonzalez said was a good reminder that communities should be informed about the laws that protect them and that people should keep pressure on the agency.“We must continue to be organized, and we must continue to defend our rights,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eb3bfc6efaf1e15c969c39a6beea1529d557c82/28_163_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17131d0c88f628b81c6631b8c3ffc2a","title":"is a new generation taking over the democratic party podcast","story":"Kamala Harris was the big winner of the first round of Democratic party debates in the US.

He faces 19 charges, including sexual assault, assault, unlawful confinement and administering a noxious substance.But a delay in proceedings was triggered by questions of whether the court should hear testimony about Coleman’s sexual history.In April, Ontario court judge Peter Doody ruled that he would allow defence lawyers to introduce evidence alleging Boyle and Coleman had previously engaged in acts of bondage and discipline (BSDM).Coleman’s attorney appealed the decision on the basis of Canada’s “rape shield” law that prevents past sexual history from being presented as a way to establish consent or patterns of sexual behaviour.In June, an Ontario superior court judge allowed Boyle’s defence to present the evidence.The trial was further delayed this month after the judge asked the crown and defence to consider whether a recent supreme court of Canada ruling on sexual history would impact Boyle’s case.The supreme court recently ordered new trials in two cases where the rape shield laws were not upheld in court.Coleman’s cross-examination continued on Wednesday. Coleman, who is an American citizen, is testifying via video link from the United States.According to the Canadian Press, defence attorney Lawrence Greenspon asked Coleman whether she had engaged in consensual sex or BDSM activities with Boyle after their return to Canada.She said they had, but that the encounters were not her idea.

The commission president designate is nominated by the 28 heads of state and government, but they must be elected by a simple majority in the European parliament to formally take on the role. Von der Leyen will be the 13th commission president, and will be the first woman in the post if parliament supports her in a vote in mid-July.Job spec: The 2007 Lisbon treaty created the current role of a full-time president, appointed by the leaders, who serves a two-and-a-half-year term, with a one-time possibility of renewal. The president represents the EU on the world stage and chairs summits of the European council, the body on which the 28 leaders sit to give the EU its political direction. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, who is in a caretaker role as negotiations over a new government continue, will be the third such president of the European council. The convention is that the role is filled by former heads of state and government.Job spec: The ECB is responsible for the monetary policy of the 19 EU member countries that have adopted the euro and acts as central supervisor of their financial institutions. Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the bank has been responsible for monetary policy in the euro area since 1 January 1999.The bank’s president is technically “first among equals” on the governing council that sets the eurozone’s interest rates, but every word issued by the incumbent moves the markets. Mario Draghi’s commitment to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro in large part saved the currency.The role demands specialist knowledge. Although Lagarde is not an economist, her experience as the outgoing managing director of the International Monetary Fund and as a former French finance minister is regarded by the leaders as being sufficient for the role. The post is filled by the European council after consultation with the eurozone group and the parliament.Job spec: The president acts as the speaker of the house, chairing debates in the plenary and ensuring parliamentary procedures are followed. They also represent the 751-strong chamber to the world. The term is for two and a half years, which can be renewed once. To be elected, a candidate must win an absolute majority of the valid votes cast. Technically, the election of a president is decided by the MEPs, but the heads of state and government, as key members of their political groups, have a heavy say. The new president, Sassoli, is a member of the Socialists and Democrats group, which lost out on the commission presidency.Job spec: The idea was that the holder of the post would shape and execute the EU’s foreign and security policy and lead the EU’s diplomatic corps, the European External Action Service.

Fire crews were being called in from nearby locations and a Canadair firefighting plane was already in action. One tourist who was hiking on the volcano was killed and another injured, local firefighters confirmed.Tourists often climb to the 924-metre (3,031ft) summit of the volcano and peer into its crater, from which small lumps of molten rock are regularly blasted into the sky.“It was like being in hell because of the rain of fire coming from the sky,” Italian news agencies quoted a local priest, Giovanni Longo, as saying.Michela Favorito, who works in a hotel near Ficogrande, on the east side of the island, said: “We saw the explosion from the hotel. There was a loud roar. We plugged our ears and after this a cloud of ash swept over us. The whole sky is full of ash, a fairly large cloud.”Thirty people were evacuated from the village of Ginostra by hydrofoil, and another ship was heading to pick up other tourists. The mayor of the nearby island of Salina, Domenico Arabia, said that beaches on the island had been closed as a precaution. Fiona Carter, a British tourist on the island of Panarea, 17 miles (27km) from Stromboli, heard the blast. “We turned around to see a mushroom cloud coming from Stromboli. Everyone was in shock. Then red-hot lava started running down the mountain towards the little village of Ginostra,” she said.“The cloud got bigger, white and grey. It enveloped Ginostra and now the cloud has covered Stromboli entirely. Several boats set off for Stromboli.”Marco Neri, a volcanologist from Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, said eruptions were very rare on Stromboli: the last one was in 2007.The island was the setting for the 1950 movie Stromboli starring Ingrid Bergman and, with other islands in the Aeolian archipelago, has become a favourite location for holiday homes for the rich and famous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c01e1e18e741f9e41a70c599e987bf3003b0dc7f/0_99_2996_1799/master/2996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=878cdfa333de68cd46b7c3f7e3dd0a33","title":"alek sigley australian student released from north korea reports","story":"Student detained for a week in North Korea says he is ‘very good’ as he arrives at airport in Beijing Alek Sigley, the 29-year-old Australian who was missing in North Korea for more than a week, has left the country and arrived safely in China.An upbeat Sigley briefly spoke to a throng of reporters waiting for him at the airport in Beijing on Thursday, saying: “I’m OK, I’m OK, yeah. I’m good. I’m very good.”.Speaking in Perth, his father, Gary Sigley, said the family were “over the moon” that his son was safe, saying he understood his son had been “in constant good spirits and well the whole time”.The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, gave the first confirmation that Sigley was safe, telling the parliament on Thursday afternoon that the 29-year-old had been released from detention by the repressive regime and had arrived safely in China.“We were advised that the DPRK have released him from detention and he has safely left the country and I can confirm that he has arrived safely.“On behalf of the Australian government I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to the Swedish authorities for their invaluable assistance in securing Alek’s prompt release, which demonstrates the value of discreet behind-the-scenes work by officials in solving sensitive consular cases in close partnership with other governments.His father told reporters outside his home in Perth he was “over the moon” to hear his son was safe.“On behalf of Alek’s family we are extremely pleased that Alek now is safe and sound in Beijing,” Gary Sigley said. “I’m sure he will reunited with his wife very soon and we hope to see him in the not-too-distant future as well and give him a big hug and kiss.He said he had missed a call from his son while he was shopping and had not yet been able to speak to him, but that he understood he had been “in constant good spirits and well the whole time”.Sigley was expected to travel to Tokyo, where his wife Yuka Morinaga lives, later on Thursday. In a statement released shortly after he spoke in parliament, Morrison said Swedish authorities had advised the government they had met with North Korean officials on Wednesday and raised Sigley’s disappearance on Australia’s behalf.He said the government was advised on Thursday morning that Sigley had been released from detention and left the country. The Swedish special envoy arrived in Pyongyang earlier this week. Payne, said on Wednesday that Australia had asked the envoy to raise Sigley’s case with the North Korean government.Sigley had been studying for a master’s degree in Korean literature at Kim Il Sung university, and runs a tour company that organises trips for foreign students. He first traveled there in 2014.He was believed to be the only Australian living in North Korea.In March, Sigley wrote for  Australia about his experience living there, saying that as a long-term foreign resident on a student visa he had “nearly unprecedented access to Pyongyang”.“I’m free to wander around the city, without anyone accompanying me,” he said. “Interaction with locals can be limited at times, but I can shop and dine almost anywhere I want.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37766ffd101f434001206830192e7a4f60fab9e5/0_306_4598_2759/master/4598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3c16398b42477fcf827390d0926d059","title":"brexit just one eu headache angela merkel avoids rocking boat","story":"As another five-year term begins, the bloc is straining for unity across a range of issuesWhen the German chancellor was asked this week why she would not railroad Italy and the so-called Visegrád group of countries – Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary – into accepting the former Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, a critic of populist governments, as European commission president, Angela Merkel’s answer was telling.“The Brexit is looming on the horizon,” Merkel said in reference to the need to avoid tensions when appointing the next head of the commission. “Other important issues are on the table. I think we need to treat each other with care.”For all the unity it has shown so far in its negotiations with the UK, the EU is straining to keep its many different constituencies onside across a range of other issues. The next five-year term offers more of the same.The ergence in values that threatens to cripple the bloc was neatly highlighted at a summit this month when Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic refused to sign up to a communique that committed to a climate-neutral EU by 2050 – a target that was already seen as too wishy-washy by green lobby groups, given the gravity of the climate emergency.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, wants to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C at a September summit. He had written to Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, asking the EU to show leadership on the world stage – and it could not.The three naysayers are seeking extra recompense for making green changes to their economies in the upcoming seven-year budget known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF), but they will face stern challenge from members, such as the Netherlands, which are firmly opposed to the EU being a “transfer union”.Indeed the negotiations over the MFF, optimistically scheduled to have finished in May, are predictably proving to be a major headache, leading the EU budget commissioner, Günther Oettinger, to recently warn: “It’s not really five minutes to midnight, it’s almost five past midnight already.”The package asks net recipients such as France and Germany to pay more as a trade-off for less being handed over in cohesion funds to the central and eastern European states, and more being invested in scientific research and development. But failure to find agreement by the end of October could lead to the EU being unable to fund the next round of Horizon Europe research and development programmes.The difficulties in the talks are understandable. The ergence in values is matched by an economic ergence from east to west and north to south that the EU has failed to bridge, despite the almost existential threat it posed during the eurozone crisis, when economies unable to borrow on the market had to come cap in hand to Berlin, only to be put on a humiliating diet of cuts as the price for help.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has championed a eurozone budget, to allow the EU to act as a sovereign nation in times of trouble, but there has only yet been agreement on a tiny symbolic pot. No wonder, then, that the populist Italian government has raged at Brussels meddling in its tax and spend plans, which it says is necessary to boost its struggling economy.But as the new leaders in Brussels – Ursula von der Leyen and Christine Lagarde as the first female presidents of the European commission and European Central Bank respectively, and Charles Michel as European council president – move into their offices this autumn, it will be Brexit that will be sucking up their time and energy.It is certain that the next British prime minister, likely to be Boris Johnson, will not secure the increasingly outlandish potential concessions being touted by the two candidates in the Tory leadership race.The battle might then be to deal with the economic costs of a no-deal Brexit and a toxic relationship with London at a time when Donald Trump’s White House piles on the pressure through tariffs on trade and China doubles down in its investments in Africa, leaving the EU trailing behind in emerging markets there. Merkel’s commitment to avoiding a row over personnel suddenly becomes more understandable."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945826.1562180930!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sitting leaving cert exam hours after appendix ruptured inhumane student","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAmy Richards first visited the doctor with pain in her abdomen about a week before the State exams began. She was told not to worry and that she was suffering symptoms of stress and irritable bowel syndrome.Amy Richards cannot remember sitting her first English Leaving Cert exam on June 5th. She had undergone surgery after her appendix ruptured and became gangrenous just hours earlier.The 18-year-old slept for three hours following the surgery at Wexford General Hospital before her mother, at Amy’s request, woke her at 7.30am so she could cram before the exam.At 9.30am she sat down at one of the hospital dinner tables, picked up her pencil and started writing.“I have no idea what I wrote, I don’t know if it was complete gibberish,” she said. “During English paper 2 and maths paper 1 the nausea was horrific. The exams were interrupted on numerous occasions so I could receive pain medication and have my drip changed.“I was trying to write but all I could think about was getting sick. I had to end both exams early and ended up on the bathroom floor getting sick.”Amy first visited the doctor with pain in her abdomen about a week before the State exams began. She was told not to worry and that she was suffering symptoms of stress and irritable bowel syndrome.A few days later she was back with a GP, who immediately sent her to a hospital emergency department.“I don’t think I’ve cried so much in my life as I did that Tuesday. I was frustrated to be missing so much time for studying and when the doctor told me I had to go to hospital I had a panic attack and couldn’t breathe,” Amy says.“When I was told at 7pm that I had appendicitis I didn’t care, I just wanted to sit the exam. I was devastated, English was one of my strongest subjects and I needed it to get the high points for medicine.”Request refusedWhen the severity of their daughter’s condition became clear, her parents contacted her school and the State Examinations Commission asking whether she could reschedule and sit the exams in July with pupils who suffer a bereavement during the Leaving Cert. Their request was refused.Having sat the HPAT, an aptitude test for medicine applicants, earlier in the year and being determined to secure the high points needed to study medicine, Amy insisted on sitting the first three exams in hospital.After being discharged, she sat the remaining exams in a private room in her school during which time she remained on heavy medication including a strong painkiller and anti-nausea medicine.“At the end of the exams I had no sense of achievement. I don’t think people understand how wrong it is to force a child to sit the most important exam of their life when they’re extremely ill,” she said. “The surgeon had told my Mum I was lucky to be alive. If someone’s life is threatened they’re not fit to sit an exam.”Amy has resigned herself to the reality that she may not have done as well as she hoped in the exams. She is looking into medical courses abroad and if she secures enough points, may study science at an Irish university. She is also considering repeating sixth year, but would have to learn an entirely new two-year syllabus for English and music.A Department of Education spokesman said a new pilot scheme had been introduced to allow Leaving Cert students who suffer a close family bereavement during the exams to sit alternative papers in July.Any extension of this would need to take into account the difficult life circumstances some students encounter during exam time, but also the need to be fair to the majority of students sitting exams and “to maintain the integrity of the examinations process”, he said.A spokeswoman for the State Examinations Commission said it was scheduled to undertake a “comprehensive review” of how best to support students experiencing “all forms of trauma and adversity” at exam time.She added that “every possible effort” was already made to accommodate students who experience accidents, illness or other trauma either immediately before or during examinations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945766.1562176387!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"development around naas has led to weak town centre watchdog","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe OPR welcomed that the draft plan for Naas contained  a regeneration strategy for the stalled town centre. Naas Main Street. File photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe The new planning watchdog has called on Kildare County Council to amend its local area plan for Naas due to concerns it is facilitating increased development on the fringes of the M7 motorway to the detriment of the town centre.The Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) has expressed concern that the draft Naas Local Area Plan (LAP) 2019-2023 is continuing and intensifying the trend of the development of a “peripheral arc” alongside the motorway.An evaluation by the OPR of the five-year plan for Naas said there had been “a sustained shift towards the M7 motorway in recent decades” in terms of town development, which had increased car dependency among local residents.The OPR said such a shift had been followed by the rapid development of low-to-medium density housing which had resulted in “a weak town centre”.One of the key functions of the planning regulator, Niall Cussen, is to ensure that statutory plans and strategies of city and county councils are consistent with legislation and government policy in relation to planning.The regulator acknowledged the county council had identified the challenge of capitalising on Naas’s strategic economic role as a self-sustaining urban centre, while moving away from unsustainable forms of development.The draft LAP acknowledges that the development of Naas is “reaching a crossroads”.Car-based travelHowever, the OPR said housing sprawl around Naas and an excessive focus on development near the M7 would draw “car-based” economic activity, given its distance from where people lived.It said new land-use zonings proposed under the draft LAP for areas near the motorway were predominantly accessible by car rather than public transport and were in locations not attractive for walking or cycling.“There is an absence of an evidential basis for such zonings,” it said. “There is also a heavy likelihood that development in this area would be likely to add to traffic levels and energy intensive car-based travel.”The OPR said allowing such a trend to continue would undermine attempts to build a stronger and vibrant town centre and would lead to the lopsided development of Naas.The regulator said the council needed to revisit elements of the draft plan to ensure it was consistent with regional and national planning policy.It criticised the absence of a transport investment and delivery plan to facilitate the proposed development of significant new housing projects on the outskirts of Naas.The OPR also called on the council to show that developments near the motorway would not negatively impact on traffic flows to and from the M7.It welcomed that the draft plan for Naas, as Kildare’s key urban centre, contained many innovative and positive features including a regeneration strategy for a stalled town centre and the Corban’s Lane area, as well as the “under-utilised” Canal Harbour.The regulator also praised the council’s intention to use legislation governing derelict and vacant sites to move on stalled developments in the town.A council spokesperson did not respond directly to recommendations made by the planning regulator.However, the spokesperson said: “A report is currently being prepared for the elected members which will have regard to all submissions received on the draft LAP.”Under legislation the council’s chief executive is obliged to provide an explanation to the OPR if it does not accept the regulator’s recommendations.The OPR can make recommendations to Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy to direct the local authority to make changes to its development plans."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Politics digest: Boris Johnson \u0026ndash a modern day Sir Roderick Spode, leader of the

arrives","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAndrew Grossen is an American living in Ireland. Photograph Nick BradshawThe During the summer of 2016, Minnesota native Andrew Grossen was interning with his state’s senator Amy Klobuchar in Washington, DC, in between academic semesters at University College Dublin. For the Fourth of July, the US holiday that commemorates the country’s declaration of independence, he got to watch the fireworks over the National Mall in the political heart of the country’s capital. It was the last year of the Obama administration, and Democrats looked set to maintain control of the White House. According to US pollster FiveThirtyEight, on that midsummer day, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had a 77.6 per cent chance of winning the presidential election the following November. Donald Trump, the political outsider and candidate for the Republican Party, was trailing her significantly. As he watched the celebrations that night, Grossen felt hopeful. “We were kind of wondering where this is going to go, but we still had that hope that it’s going to be okay,” he remembers. Now, more than two years into a Trump presidency, the Fourth of July is a more reflective and lower-key US national day of celebration for Grossen, who is still living in Ireland pursuing his master’s degree.He spent a year of his secondary school education in Tipperary and loved Ireland so much he returned to do his undergraduate degree in Dublin. Arriving on Irish soil during the Obama administration, there was a certain pride in being American. There were people who very critical of the US at that time, and that was to be expected, according to Grossen. But now, things feel different for him. “I still love my hometown, my home state and the people in America,” he says, but he finds there is a challenge there in conveying the view that opposing the American government is not opposing the American people. Irish people, according to him, overwhelmingly understand his position. Among the crowds at the anti-Trump protest in Dublin last month, “the people I saw and met really made that clear and welcomed me as an American in that protest”. The Dublin demonstration was one of many that took place across the country in response to the US president’s visit, and the 6m inflatable Trump baby blimp was on loan from London for the occasion. Salute to AmericaA month after his Irish visit, Trump is set to host a Salute to America celebration in Washington, DC, on the Fourth of July. He will deliver an address at the National Mall, the same stretch of monuments where Grossen watched the commemorative fireworks three years earlier. NBC News reported that top donors to the Republican National Committee were given the best tickets to the event. The event, US-born Wexford resident Wendy Connolly says, is “everything in America that we need to solve being celebrated”. Six years ago, Connolly attended one last Fourth of July celebration in her local town of Cerritos, California, before moving to Ireland. She remembers people from all sorts of backgrounds gathering in the town park, bringing all of their traditions to one place. Her local congresswoman, representative Loretta Sanchez from the Democratic Party, sat at a card table listening to her constituents’ stories and complaints. People brought food to the celebration, children played together, and a fireworks display crackled in the evening sky. “And I looked around, it was extremely poignant, and thought: ‘Yes.’ This was the snapshot of America that I want to bring with me,” Connolly recalls. “This is where the whole world washes up, brings its best, and starts to create something new. Needless to say, back then I had no idea how fragile that would be.” Connolly believes Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, whether you agreed with the minutiae of his administration or not, was civil and “represented America to other nations in a very capable and gracious way”. Now, she says, the first question out of people’s mouths when they hear her accent in Ireland is how does she feel about Trump. “There’s caution there and I don’t blame them in the slightest,” she says. Cause for celebrationHowever, for other Americans living Ireland, Trump’s presidency has been a cause for celebration. For former New York City police officer Thomas O’Hara, who is currently based in the Irish midlands, the president’s message of “America First” was appealing. According to O’Hara, Trump was the right man for the right time. Someone who wasn’t a politician, who was moving back to having pride in being American. In the wake of the US president meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last week, O’Hara says that predictions of war between the two countries under a Trump presidency turned out to be wide of the mark. “Look what’s going on now,” he says, “they’re talking.” For Thomas, this Fourth of July and the ones preceding it under a Trump presidency don’t feel any different. “I’ve always been patriotic,” he says, “I’ve always stood for the national anthem, saluted the national anthem. “So as a registered Republican, I’m happy, especially with what’s going on over there at the moment. It just seems the other side is trying to get away from everything American.” With the majority of Americans continuing to disapprove of Trump’s presidency, according to the latest polls, the country’s citizens both at home and abroad remain deeply ided along political faultlines. But, for Maureen Lancaster, an American living in Cork who splits her time between the US and Ireland, the Fourth of July offers a time for unity. “For me, it symbolises that hope that our generation can live up to the challenge and find a better way,” she says, “including those who support our current president in that effort, and not contribute further to the deep polarisation and isions within the American people.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946434.1562222501!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defence forces members set to see immediate pay rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDefence Forces on a UN interim force in Lebanon. Photograph: Defence Forces Press OfficeMembers of the Defence Forces are set to see their take-home pay rise immediately on Thursday as the Cabinet is expected to approve proposals for a €10.1 million package of increases in salaries and allowances. Military service allowances, which currently range from €42 to €123 per week, are expected to be raised by 10 per cent, as part of a move to improve recruitment and retention of personnel. Pay cuts imposed in 2013 are also expected to be reversed as part of the package. In addition, a loyalty bonus - which could be up to €20,000 - is expected to be put in place to encourage pilots to remain in the Defence Forces.The Government is also expected to announce a series of non-pay initiatives for the Defence Forces, including an action plan to cover areas such as career development, workforce planning and familywork balance measures.A review of pay for up to 2,500 members of the Defence Forces with specialist or technical skills is expected to be recommended. Among those likely to be encompassed by such a review would be cooks, mechanics, technicians, fitters, carpenters, aircraft mechanics, military police investigators and air-traffic controllers.Sources said military organisations may be permitted to hold talks with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions regarding some form of partial affiliation with the trade union movement. However, sources said the Government would not grant Defence Forces members the right to go on strike. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe is expected to tell the Cabinet that the cost of increasing the military service allowance by 10 per cent would be approximately €4.8 million in a full year. The proposals, which are to be presented to Cabinet by Mr Donohoe, are based on a report drawn up by the Public Service Pay Commission. If approved by Government, as expected, the new increased allowances would come into effect immediately. The commission’s report will likely be published by Mr Donohoe and Minister of State at the Department of Defence Paul Keogh later on Thursday. The pay proposals were due to be announced earlier this week, but the Tuesday Cabinet meeting was rescheduled as the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar attended the extended EU summit in Brussels. Numbers in the Defence Forces have continued to fall despite recent recruitment campaigns. The full strength of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps combined should be a minimum of 9,500 personnel, but has now fallen below 8,500. This is the lowest point since numbers increased in the 1970s in response to the Troubles. There have been concerns in Government over recent weeks that its planned package for the Defence Forces would not meet the expectations of those campaigning for improved pay and conditions.Following the publication of its plans, the Government is likely to wait to see whether the military representative bodies decide to put the new proposals to a ballot of members. Sources said Wednesday night the organisation representing enlisted personnel, Pdforra, would read the proposals and decide on whether to put the measures to a ballot.The Public Service Pay Commission report is expected to say it was constrained by its terms of reference from making recommendations on increasing core pay for Defence Forces personnel. It will instead propose increases in allowances for Defence Force personnel and urge that other reviews of remuneration for those in technical and specialist areas take place.Retention difficulties The commission will say the Defence Forces are facing a unique challenge in retaining pilots, with official projections suggesting the numbers in place may be close to 30 per cent lower than the approved levels this year. It will urge the re-introduction of a loyalty bonus scheme which could be worth nearly €20,000 to pilots.The report is also likely to highlight difficulties in retaining other key specialist personnel such as military aircraft maintenance technicians, air traffic controllers , engineering and ordnance officers in the Army and engineers in the Naval Service.The commission is also expected to say it has evidence of retention difficulties at captain and certain non-commissioned officer levels and that some system of incentivising such personnel to remain in place should be looked at as a priority in future pay negotiations.The report is due to propose that a pay review be undertaken for personnel in technical pay grades and to suggest that there should be significant reforms to the way personnel are recruited.It is likely to argue the Government should consider extending the permitted age for new entrants and re-enlisting or re-commissioning retired staff to assist in the training of new personnel. This would allow serving personnel to concentrate on operational duties. The report is also expected to call on the Government to put in place a series of non-pay measures to try to assist in the retention of military personnel.The commission will say it was prevented by its terms of reference from undertaking a general review on behalf of any group. The report will say the pay structures of the Defence Forces should be examined in the future as part of a general review - which the commission had previously proposed in a report last year - of the adequacy of pay arrangements in the public service.It will urge that the military service allowance be increased by 10 per cent with a minimum increase of €350 per year applicable to those on lower rates of the allowance.The report will also recommend that as a result of the absence of overtime or limits on working hours in the Defence Forces, cuts made to a number of other allowances in 2013 such as the security duty allowance and the patrol duty allowance for naval personnel should be reversed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945892.1562186172!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people are not spending their money here the slow recovery of naas","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVacant shop fronts on the Main Street of Naas, Co. Kildare. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The recovery from the recession has been slow for many business owners operating on Main Street in Naas, Co Kildare.The county’s population has risen in recent years and while housing is hard to come by in some areas, many commercial units lie empty.The half-finished shell of the Naas Shopping Centre, the building off Main Street which was abandoned during the financial crash, is a stark reminder of the investment needed to revive the town centre.“This town is crying out for an anchor,” says Martina Phipps, who has run the arts and crafts shop Tuckmill Gallery on Main Street for more than three decades.Phipps is proud of the “niche” stores the town offers, but says it can be difficult to buy everyday items and groceries.“If you didn’t know the town well you wouldn’t think you could buy a pint of milk here,” she adds.Over the years, the shopkeeper has seen larger retailers like Penneys and Superquinn pull out of the area.The town’s retail offerings have been dwarfed by popularity of the Monread Shopping Centre and a Tesco Superstore on the outskirts of Naas, the Whitewater Shopping Centre in Newbridge, and Kildare Village up the N7.Phipps finds the Tesco to be “far too big and cold, but of course there is free parking and you can’t argue with that”.A Dunnes Stores food hall is set to open in the middle of the Main Street in August, which has the potential to bring a lot of business back into the town, she adds.“There used to be a Superquinn in the centre, which was always such a busy spot. Hopefully now this will draw people back in.”Although retailers, such as herself, can avail of local government grants to repair or upgrade store fronts,\u0026nbspPhipps feels the council could do more to incentivise new business in the town.“It is a bit of a contention of mine because I grew up here and I saw things change,” she says. The rates are high, so there has been little uptake of units except for charity shops, which benefit from tax concessions, she adds.‘Lack of people’Some locals have taken matters into their own hands. The Naas Regeneration Group, formed by local businesses and other volunteers, started a town voucher scheme which aims to encourage people to shop locally.“Maybe it is baby steps, but it feels like we are gaining a little bit of momentum,” Phipps adds.Dressing the Main Street since 1980, Mary Fielding’s soft-furnishings shop, Finishing Touches, lost staff members and customers during the financial crash.Although Kildare is classified as the third-wealthiest county in Ireland, Fielding says neither her business nor her staff numbers have fully recovered from the crash.There is no doubt that online shopping has played a role, but the shopping complexes that opened on the town’s periphery have also been contributing factors, she says.While Naas is full of young couples, there is a “distinct lack of people in the town,” she adds, as many people who have moved to the area in recent years spend nearly all of their time in Dublin.New to the street, Charles McAvoy says he “took a risk” in choosing to open a men’s shoe shop just two months ago.“I will only know in about a year if that risk has paid off,” he says. “The town has a vibrancy, there is no doubt about that, but it is still quite depressed... Naas is supposed to be one of the wealthiest towns in Ireland. I would challenge that, because people are not spending their money here.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945932.1562189363!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us ambassador vows to try to enhance relationship with ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador to Ireland Edward F Crawford at the ambassador’s residence in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Photograph: Nick BradshawUS ambassador to Ireland Edward Crawford has spoken of his pride at being chosen for the role and said he intended to do everything he could to enhance relations between the nations.Speaking in front of a crowd that US chargé d’affairs Reese Smyth called “1,500 Irish friends”, Edward F Crawford (81) explained that US president Donald Trump had offered him an ambassador posting before he had even been elected.Asked by Mr Trump what country he would prefer, Mr Crawford responded: “Ireland”. When it was suggested that he give Mr Trump three choices, Mr Crawford said these were “Ireland, Ireland, Ireland”.Mr Crawford, a businessman from comes from Cleveland, Ohio, made his first public appearance as ambassador at an Independence Day garden party in the grounds of his residence in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. On a warm summer’s evening, he joked that he had brought the weather with him from the US.“I had dreamed about serving my country. I was approached by someone you know the name of before he was even elected. I have known him for some time,” he said.“I am going to do everything I can to enhance the relationship between America and Ireland – undeniably one of the strongest relationships. America was one of the first countries in the world to recognise Ireland.”Confirmation processHe recalled the arduous 17-month process between being nominated by Mr Trump and his confirmation as ambassador and paid the tribute to Mr Smyth, who effectively served as ambassador during the lengthy hiatus between appointments.Mr Crawford introduced his family on stage – his wife, Mary his son, Matthew his daughter-in-law, Deborah and their three grandchildren – Colin, Catherine and Claire. Matthew described his father as a “strong, smart and caring leader” and “one of the most successful charismatic and passionate business leaders from America”.His father’s story was “very Irish-American – a hardworking young man who started at the very bottom and then builds a big business one day at at time”.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar recalled that Mr Crawford’s parents had left Ireland in 1925 for the US and had passed through Ellis Island. The new ambassador’s mother, Kay, came from Co Cork.“They made the American dream their own. Today I can only imagine what it would mean to them to see their son return to Ireland as United States ambassador – the fulfilment of another dream,” Mr Varadkar said.He joked that Mr Crawford was not a week in the country and was already throwing the “best party of the summer”.Mr Varadkar said Mr Trump had given him a copy of an order sent by Gen George Washington to his troops in 1780 giving them the next day off, which was St Patrick’s Day. Washington did so, having called the Irish a “brave and generous people”.“We are two countries united by our shared heritage and our deep, abiding friendship,” Mr Varadkar said. “We are strong partners and in the years ahead we intend to work together trading and investing and creating employment on both sides of the Atlantic with almost as many people in America working for Irish-owned firms as there are Irish people working for American-owned firms.“Over the centuries, Ireland has benefited so much from the courage and generosity of the American people. For that we are forever grateful.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945896.1562186450!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government denies it is at odds with michael creed over beef deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Creed has vowed to ‘thwart’ the EU’s Mercosur deal. File photograph: Tom HonanThe Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has said he intends to “frustrate”, “dismantle” and “thwart” the EU-Mercosur trade agreement in order to protect the interests of the Irish beef sector. Mr Creed’s comments on the EU agreement with four South American nations appear to be at variance with Government policy, which is to examine the deal “in the round” and carry out an economic and environmental assessment before a decision is made on whether to oppose it or not.A spokesman for Government and Mr Creed’s spokesman denied that the Minister was at odds with the Government position on the deal. However, his pledge to seek to ”thwart” the deal goes much further than anything Taoiseach Leo Varadkar or any other Minister has said on the matter to date.Mr Varadkar told the Dáil that he would vote against the agreement if the economic and environmental assessments showed it to be against Irish interests and said that the Government would seek to protect Irish beef farmers. However, he said that the Government must recognise that Mercosur – a bloc made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – is “a market of 250 million people and while there may be losses for some sectors there could be significant benefits for others and we need to look at that in the round”. Under the deal, announced last week after some 20 years of negotiations, the EU has agreed to accept 99,000 tonnes of South American beef into its market each year, which farmers claim could cost the Irish beef sector up to €750 million annually.The deal, which is unlikely to be voted on for at least two years, also covers other sectors such as pharmaceuticals, services, machinery, and other food stuffs – including the importation of tens of thousands of tonnes of poultry and pig meat into the EU.Negative effectsMinister for Business Heather Humphreys told the Dáil that “there are benefits in certain sectors but there are also negatives” in the deal. However, Mr Creed went much further, saying he would not be found “defending the indefensible”. “I have stated my view clearly. I have a responsibility to use the time available to us following the announcement of a headline agreement between the European Commission and Mercosur states to ensure everything is done to frustrate and mitigate, dismantle the ambition and protect the interests of the beef sector,” he said, adding that environmental and climate change requirements could be used to “thwart” the deal.“Collectively, the challenge is to make progress on these matters in a way that will diminish the ambition of Mercosur.”Government sources pointed to Mr Creed being under pressure from the wider agriculture sector and in his constituency. Mr Creed’s comments did not go unnoticed in Brussels, with one senior European Commission source wondering if the Minister would resign due to being at variance with Government policy on the deal.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillDark memories of Kylie Minogue swept across Leo Varadkar’s mind and he was suddenly afraid.The Taoiseach paused, stopped in his tracks by thoughts of that breathlessly penned “Dear Kylie” note last year when he told the Aussie superstar he was a “huge fan!” and was really looking forward to seeing her in concert, and could he welcome her to Ireland personally as his office is right across the road from her hotel?He got dog’s abuse for doing that.Tina Turner turned up in the Dáil on Wednesday. There was no advance notice so no opportunity of a fanboy repeat for Leo.She surfaced during the long tributes to former Fianna Fáil TD for Galway West, Mark Killilea, who died in December.In fairness, this was not expected.The Leas Ceann Comhairle, Pat ‘the Cope’ Gallagher, was a great pal of the politician, who was a deputy back in the late 1970s and early 1980s before becoming a senator and then a long serving MEP.Pat remembered being on the election trail with “Markeen” in 1994 along with the music blaring from the campaign bus.“And when I go west of Ireland I still hear Tina Turner in my ear, singing ‘Simply the Best’. He felt he was simply the best and it was an exciting campaign.”The Taoiseach was 11 months old on the day Killilea first entered the Dáil, but he paid a warm tribute on behalf of his party to a fellow politician who was respected on all sides.“I didn’t have the privilege ever to meet Mark Killilea but I am delighted to learn today that we both shared a love of Tina Turner,” he began, before hurriedly adding: “but I’m happy to inform the House that we’re not currently in correspondence.”Fan mailA laughing Leo, hands up in mock horror, stressed his fan mail days were behind him.“Or ever, by the way, just in case you want to ask.”Labour leader Brendan Howlin recalled Killilea was in the thick of things during the turbulent Haughey era.“I suppose most political commentators remember the very odd . . . ,” he began, about to elaborate on those colourful days when he was struck by a thought: “You see, this Dáil – people think it’s very bizarre but it’s calm in comparison to the Dáil during that era.”So bizarre and boring are interchangeable words now.He looked back to the time Killilea was a junior minister for posts and telegraphs, when people often had to wait years to get a phone line into their home. They made representations to their local TDs in case they could influence the process. Howlin was told Markeen always kept a number of the old-fashioned handsets in his car and gave them to constituents.“They would still have to wait two years for the connection, but it would give them hope.”Meanwhile, the needle between the Taoiseach and leader of the main Opposition party continued to fester nicely.The flashpoint for Wednesday’s squabble was the Dunkettle roundabout.This legendary traffic interchange on the road to Cork city is earmarked for an upgrade under the government’s much vaunted Project 2040 plan. But nothing much is happening and local man Micheál Martin is keen to find out why.He asked the Taoiseach to explain the delay, elaborate on the rumours of major cost overruns and say when construction will begin.The Taoiseach snippily remarked he was glad the Fianna Fáil leader supports the project because his spokespeople think some of the road projects should be reviewed.The only person to suggest such a thing was Senator Jerry Buttimer, bristled Micheál from Cork South Central, referring to the former Fine Gael deputy for Cork South Central.Well then, deflected Leo, apropos of nothing Micheál was asking, what projects do you want reviewed?He was told to stop being silly. People want to know when Dunkettle roundabout will be finished.“They want to know if you’re going to cancel the roads programme,” niggled the Taoiseach, inadvertently intimating that Fianna Fáil might be back in government soon.Carry-on“They don’t want to know about the rest of the roads,” groaned an exasperated Micheál. “They don’t believe in that silly carry-on. It’s just your press office on steroids.”The bickering continued later when the pair were at odds again over the funding and future of major projects, including Dunkettle. The Fianna Fáil leader asked for a response which wasn’t “petty, silly and idiotic”.Leo, just back from rubbing shoulders in Brussels with fellow European prime ministers, was in a truculent mood. Probably finding it difficult to be back among the domestic plodders having soared with political giants.One day being spoken of as a compromise candidate for president of the European Commission (flattered but not at the moment), the next dealing with Dáil accusations over housing, the minimum wage and a traffic intersection in Cork.No wonder he was a bit short with the locals.“I’m always amused and bemused that deputy Martin likes to accuse me of being partisan and personal, yet, as evidenced by his name-calling today he’s very capable of being partisan and personalised himself,” remarked Leo levelly.Micheál calls him petty, silly and idiotic.“Hold me coat!” says Leo, before he floors everyone with his strange reaction.“It kinda reminds me of one of those parish priests who preaches from the altar telling us to avoid sin while secretly going behind the altar engaging in any amount of sin himself.”Whoa! What did he just say?In the chamber, Micheál Martin was speechless.Elaine Loughlin of the Irish Examiner quickly tweeted the comment.“To be honest Elaine, I think this reflects more on the Taoiseach than anyone else,” he sadly concluded.Meanwhile, Michael Creed is cracking on with his plan to “thwart” the beef element of the Mercosur trade deal. With Irish farmers up in arms over the draft agreement, the Minister for Agriculture is vocally championing their cause.It’ll be no pantomime and it’s going to run for years, but Creed intends to ride to the rescue of beef farmers and scupper those aspects of the plan which are damaging to beef farmers by using a variety of disruptive tactics.White Knight and the Seven Thwarts – frustrate, dismantle, mitigate, delay, obstruct protest, outfox – whatever it takes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946447.1562224088!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pay review for defence forces following effective campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPay review in store for Defence Forces.

Photograph: Jorge SilvaReuters. A “red-button” mechanism will be built into the Mercosur trade agreement which would allow farms, regions and even countries to be shut out of the controversial deal if they sell sub-standard products into the European market.EU sources said action could ensue against producers within 15 days if they do not meet food and feed safety as well as animal and plant health standards.Under the agreement, negotiated over some 20 years, the EU has agreed to except 99,000 tonnes of South American beef into its market each year. The deal also covers other sectors such as pharmaceuticals, services, machinery and other foodstuffs – including the importation of 180,000 tonnes of poultry into the EU and 25,000 tonnes of pig meat.Irish farmers have taken issue with the deal, which is not due to be formally voted on for at least two years, with lobby groups saying the beef element of it could cost the Irish meat sector up to €750 million annually. The “red-button” mechanism in the deal would allow the shutting off of a supply from a farm, region or country, the source added. Farms and regions would be vetted and the “red-button would be pushed where there are scares”.“For someone to export as a third country to the EU, the inidual abattoirs and processors must be on our list, so if you are off the list because the producer is found not to be respecting our rules, it is going to be a major challenge to get back on to that list,” the source added. Climate change A provision is also understood to be contained in the soon-to-be published agreement for potential sanctions if the countries involved break their climate change commitments under the Paris Agreement.Ireland currently exports some €483 million in goods a year to the four Mercosur countries – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – with the proposed trade agreement providing for savings on customs duties by eliminating duties on 92 per cent of all tariff lines.EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan said on Wednesday that the new arrangements will not be introduced overnight. “This beef quota will be implemented over several years, not starting before 2022 and then only over the following five years in annual instalments. In other words, it will be up to 2028 before this deal is fully implemented.”The deal includes a safeguard clause which can be used if the EU agro-industry is seriously affected by increased imports, and Mr Hogan said €1 billion in financial assistance will be made available for farmers if necessary.“This is the first time that any such funding has been made available in the context of any trade agreement,” he added. “Already, Ireland has a €1 billion surplus with Mercosur in traded services and we export nearly €500 million worth of goods to the region. These goods come from companies all over Ireland in sectors that support over 110,000 jobs in Ireland in such areas as chemicals and pharmaceuticals, medical devices and machinery and electrical.”Mr Hogan said he welcomed the Government’s decision to hold an economic evaluation into the potential impact of the deal on various sectors."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946436.1562221568!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"australian student detained in north korea released","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA handout photograph from the Sigley family showing Alek Sigley, who is one of only a handful of Western students who studies Korean literature at Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang, North Korea.An Australian student has been released after a week in detention in North Korea and is “safe and well”, Australia’s prime minister has said.Swedish diplomats had raised the case of Alek Sigley (29) with North Korean authorities in Pyongyang where Australia does not have an embassy.“I’m pleased to announce that Mr Alex Sigley has been today released from detention in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK),” Scott Morrison told Australia’s parliament to cheers from politicians.“Alex is safe and well.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignJuly 4th 2019: How a tax on playing cards and a thwarted tea shipment led to American Independence DayRoyal Marines in

Camilla Tominey and Natasha Bernal profiled the millennials behind the online activities of many of the party\u0027s MPs.Following the debate over whether or not Tory MP Rory Stewart had been an MI6 spy, a former intelligence analyst and operational officer discussed what life is like once you leave the world of espionage behind.With the issue of how borders are policed and controlled post-Brexit never far from the news, Tom Hoggins looked at the futuristic technology that could be used on Britain\u0027s borders.To listen,  simply click the \u0027play\u0027 button of the recording you wish to listen to.‘If you\u0027re looking for profit, this isn’t the business for you’: why music festivals are no moneyspinners Meet the millennials helping the Tory leadership hopefuls go viral The secrecy of being in MI6 is tough - but life gets harder once you leaveFrom drone swarms to AI border guards: How futuristic technology could be used to police Britain\u0027s borders July 4th 2019: How a tax on playing cards and a thwarted tea shipment led to American Independence DayRoyal Marines in Gibraltar detain supertanker suspected of delivering Iranian oil to SyriaHiker killed as volcano erupts on Italian tourist island of StromboliSimone Burns, Human rights lawyer jailed for abusing Air India cabin crew, found dead at Beachy HeadTrump puts himself centre stage as tanks feature in Independence Day \u0026#39show of a lifetime\u0026#39Comment: The latest backroom-dealing in Brussels shows the Franco-German alliance in actionAlek Sigley, Australian missing in North Korea, is \u0026#39alive and well\u0026#39 in ChinaTheresa May urges successor to defend the Union as Nicola Sturgeon claims her legacy will be Scottish independenceComment: Boris should weigh the evidence on sugar taxes against Britain\u0026#39s obesity crisisNorth Korea says US \u0026#39hell-bent on hostile acts\u0026#39 despite wanting to talkBaby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: where, when and everything you need to know about the royal serviceTheresa May to snub Tory Party Conference to speak at literary festival insteadBoris Johnson unveils £1 billion plan to put bobbies back on the beatPrivate schools told to open up places and facilities to children in careOne in ten patients in NHS hospitals is alcohol dependent, Kings College study findsGive free care to the elderly, next Prime Minister is urged Bring in laws to force companies to make recycling labels simpler, MPs toldAndy Burnham claims \u0026#39northerners face discrimination in London\u0026#39 as he criticises upper-classes PMsInvestigation shows hospitals with sewage spillages, collapsed ceilings and babies left to freezeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/03/TELEMMGLPICT000202663901_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7GgL7o0_ESnuLxJzSWOePQE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"end french exchange red tape safeguarding culture blamed decline","story":"Now just a quarter (25 per cent) of state secondaries now offer exchanges, down from 29 per cent last year and 30 per cent in 2014It was once considered a rite of passage for secondary pupils. But the French exchange is becoming a thing of the past, according to a British Council report which found that red tape is partly to blame for its decline.Sending children on exchanges has “fallen out of fashion” in part due to the “safeguarding culture” and Government red tape, according to Vicky Gough, schools advisor to the British Council.Guidelines from the Department for Education state that English families that host foreign pupils should undergo Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks and for this reason many schools and local authorities are put off, she said.“Because the regulations say parents should be DBS-checked, this makes people think this is a risky undertaking,” Ms Gough told the . “Some schools and local authorities don’t allow any to take place for this reason. The whole culture of safeguarding has changed”.Now just a quarter (25 per cent) of state secondaries now offer exchanges, down from 29 per cent last year and 30 per cent in 2014, the British Council’s annual language trends survey found.The poll of 1,600 teachers showed that while a greater proportion of private schools organise exchanges, they have seen a steeper decline over the same time period.Just under half (48 per cent) of fee-paying schools currently offer the trips, down from 53 per cent last year and 77 per cent in 2014.“When I was at school everyone did an exchange, everyone’s older brothers and sisters had done one,” Ms Gough said.“If it’s something that has always happened, pupils have heard about it from others and seen their photos, they feel comfortable.  “But when it falls out fashion and falls out of the school’s culture, it then sounds a bit odd and risky.”Ms Gough said that exchanges may be declining faster in private schools than in their state counterparts due to the management being more “risk averse” and cautionary.At a glance | How to learn another languageShe said state schools are under more financial as well as time pressure, and may not see organising exchange trips as a priority.Ms Gough told how at in the mid 1990s, every secondary school in Durham did one or even two exchanges, but now there is only one secondary left that does it.The number of pupils taking French and German GCSEs and A-levels has plummeted in recent years.Entries for GCSEs in both subjects has dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent. A-level entries are also declining, but at more gradual rate.Earlier this year, the Government set up a £2.5 million fund for schools to spend on taking disadvantaged children on trips abroad, including foreign language exchange trips. Ministers hope that the move will boost the numbers of pupils taking modern foreign languages at GCSE.Do you have fond memories of foreign exchanges from schooldays gone by?

It is estimated that for every teacher’s death, nine children will die, meaning over 100 people will die every year in the UK as a result of exposure when they were at school. There is no statutory duty on schools to report their asbestos management, Ms Sweeney said, which means many turn a blind eye to the potential danger it poses.  “Primary schools contain children who are boisterous,” she told The Daily . “If you don’t know where the asbestos is, how can you ever ensure they aren’t disturbed?  “The simple act of putting a pin into a wall to put a display up can puncture the wall and that might release fibres – teachers at the very least should know where the asbestos is.”  A Government report published in 2017 found that asbestos in schools is a “serious” problem which could threaten the health of children, as it concluded that thousands of schools are failing to follow safety guidelines. Liz Darlison, from Mesothelioma UK, the national charity for asbestos-related cancer, said that because developing the disease can take several decades following exposure, the dangers of asbestos are “perhaps not fully appreciated”.  She said: “Many people still think that asbestos is a problem of the past and that asbestos-related illnesses only occur in trades’ people or people who have worked in the construction industry.“This is simply not the case. The potentially deadly material has been used in all types of buildings and is still present in many primary schools due to aging school buildings.”A Department for Education spokesman said it plans to publish the findings of its Asbestos Management Assurance Process school survey shortly.  “Since 2015, we have already allocated more than £7.4 billion to those responsible for school buildings to maintain and improve the school estate, including removing asbestos when it is the safest course of action, the spokesman added. Poll puts Labour support at historic low amid Brexit flip-flopping and anti-Semitism rowJuly 4th 2019: How a tax on playing cards and a thwarted tea shipment led to American Independence DayRoyal Marines in Gibraltar detain supertanker suspected of delivering Iranian oil to SyriaHiker killed as volcano erupts on Italian tourist island of StromboliSimone Burns, Human rights lawyer jailed for abusing Air India cabin crew, found dead at Beachy HeadTrump puts himself centre stage as tanks feature in Independence Day \u0026#39show of a lifetime\u0026#39Comment: The latest backroom-dealing in Brussels shows the Franco-German alliance in actionAlek Sigley, Australian missing in North Korea, is \u0026#39alive and well\u0026#39 in ChinaComment: Boris should weigh the evidence on sugar taxes against Britain\u0026#39s obesity crisisTheresa May urges successor to defend the Union as Nicola Sturgeon claims her legacy will be Scottish independenceNorth Korea says US \u0026#39hell-bent on hostile acts\u0026#39 despite wanting to talkBaby Archie Harrison\u0026#39s christening: where, when and everything you need to know about the royal serviceTheresa May to snub Tory Party Conference to speak at literary festival insteadBoris Johnson unveils £1 billion plan to put bobbies back on the beatPrivate schools told to open up places and facilities to children in careOne in ten patients in NHS hospitals is alcohol dependent, Kings College study findsGive free care to the elderly, next Prime Minister is urged Bring in laws to force companies to make recycling labels simpler, MPs toldAndy Burnham claims \u0026#39northerners face discrimination in London\u0026#39 as he criticises upper-classes PMsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bring laws force companies make recycling labels simpler mps","story":"Consumers are confused about what they can and cannot recycle Retailers should be forced to introduce binary labeling to clearly inform consumers whether a product is recyclable or not, amid widespread confusion, two industry leaders had said.Stuart Lendrum, Head of Packaging at Iceland, told the Environment Food and Rural Affairs committee that the government must introduce laws to simplify the current system which uses dozens of symbols, most of which the public does not understand.Karen Graley, Packaging Manager at Waitrose, agreed that the government should legislate.“Absolutely, we\u0027d support that, moving to a binary label as soon as possible so we make it easier for consumers to understand what to do with the material and a piece of packaging,” she told MPs.The comments were made as part of the select committee\u0027s inquiry into \u0027Plastic food and drink packaging\u0027. The  recently launched a Zero Waste campaign calling on the government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s recycling rates and make the process simpler.The UK has no national strategy for recycling with local authorities accepting a variety of materials and processing them in different ways, which means some households are able to recycle specific items when others are not.The current recycling labeling is also confusing with a plethora of different labels which indicate whether a product can be recycled or not. The Keep Britain Tidy ‘tidyman’ logo, for example, which shows a man putting paper in a bin, is often mistaken for a ‘recyclable’ sign, when it is just encouraging people to pick up litter.Even the Keep Britain Tidy logo is confusing for consumers Conversely the symbol of a man putting a bottle in a bin surrounded by a triangle means that it is glass which should be recycled.Likewise, the recycling triangle logo containing a number inside seems to suggest a plastic is recyclable.  But numbers ‘3’ for PVC and ‘6’ for polystyrene are virtually never recycled by councils because it is too difficult. Mr Lendrum told MPs that there were too many different types of material being made, and too much confusion for consumers.“We need fewer materials, we\u0027ve got to simplify the material mix of what\u0027s being used, we\u0027ve got to simplify the labeling to support that and move to a binary \u0027it\u0027s recyclable or it\u0027s not\u0027 and make it mandatory so it\u0027s the same labeling on every single pack that\u0027s on sale in the UK,” he said.“We\u0027re not at the mandatory labeling system yet, we\u0027re not yet at the binary labeling system and we still have too many different materials.” There are dozens of recycling symbolsA separate survey by YouGov on behalf of Keep Britain Tidy and Brita UK, also found that just half of businesses are offering recycling services in the workplace, while four in 10 are doing nothing to reduce plastic waste, a new survey has found.The study of more than 1,000 small to medium sized firms (SMEs) found just a quarter believe they have a responsibility to help customers and staff reduce their use of single-use plastic. And fewer than one in five (18 per cent) have replaced single-use plastics with reusable alternatives. Nearly half (44 per cent) do not think their business has a responsibility to provide recycling facilities in the workplace and only one in three (29 per cent) think they are responsible for encouraging customers to recycle.There are 5.7 million small and medium-sized businesses in the UK, accounting for 99 per cent of all businesses.Allison Ogden-Newton, Keep Britain Tidy Chief Executive, said: “This research makes for shocking reading but it is not simply about knocking businesses for inaction – it is about understanding the barriers they face and looking to work with them to offer the expertise, support and guidance that will help them transform for good.“Keep Britain Tidy is a charity that is focused on developing solutions and, through these solutions, helping businesses tackle the problems of waste, including single-use plastic.“The public are willing to get out there and do something to clean up the plastic that they see around them – more than half a million volunteers gave their time during the Great British Spring Clean to do just that – and businesses must support the public by playing their part.” Sarah Taylor, Managing Director of Brita UK, said: “The last few years have seen a sea change in our awareness of the impact of single-use plastic on the marine and wider environment.It’s been exciting to see so many household name businesses take big steps to reduce their single-use plastic footprint, from providing staff with reusable alternatives, such as reusable water bottles and coffee cups, to trialling refill schemes for customers in stores.Real change will only be achieved if the business community comes together to find solutions to the challenges posed by single-use plastic.”Poll puts Labour support at historic low

Groenen and the Netherlands will contest Sunday’s final, after her fine strike beat Sweden to settle an otherwise unremarkable contest.This had none of the controversy, intensity or drama of Tuesday’s semi-final, played on the same pitch 24 hours earlier. The United States will not be troubled by anything they witnessed here. England’s players will have watched two teams short on quality with one persistent, nagging question: “What if?”But while Phil Neville and his players will be in Nice this weekend, attempting to rise themselves for a third-place play-off against this Swedish side, the Netherlands will be 90 minutes away from becoming world as well as European champions. For a team who qualified for the first World Cup four years ago, it is some achievement.Head coach Saerina Wiegman should thank her goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal, who made several important saves when Sweden were marginally on top. Much of the credit must go to Groenen, who capitalised on the space the Swedes offered her, striking low into the far corner to seal the final berth.The first half was poor. Van Veenendaal, one of the Netherlands’ four-strong Arsenal contingent, was the most vocal member of their pre-match huddle and the busiest of their players in those opening 45 minutes. Sweden edged them - with two shots on target to one by their opponents - and the goalkeeper had to be alert for both attempts.Created with Sketch. Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A woman in Stina Blackstenius’ form would usually convert the first. Sofia Jakobsson’s delicate work in midfield slipped Sweden’s match-winner from the quarter-final through one-on-one. Her shot was right down Van Veenendaal’s throat, even if she only collected the ball at the second time of asking.The Dutch ‘keeper’s handling was questionable at times, particularly on the flat and straight corners Sweden insisted on playing. One failure to come and collect allowed Elin Rubensson to shoot from the edge of the area, and when that attempt was blocked, Lina Hurtgi pounced on the rebound. Van Veenendaal beat the shot away with her feet.Her best save, however, came in the slightly-improved second half. Another awkward corner spread panic in the Netherlands’ penalty area, with space eventually opening up for Nila Fischer. The centre-half’s low drive was destined for the far, left-hand corner until Van Veenendaal’s fingertips erted it onto the post. It was an excellent save.At the other end of the pitch, the Netherlands were offering very little, especially for a team whose attacking talent lit up the 2017 European Championship and was much-vaunted at the start of this tournament. They too had to resort to the more prosaic form of set-piece play and it was not long before they had also hit the woodwork.Vivianne Miedema had been largely anonymous up until this point, but on one corner swung in from the right she managed to peel away from the Swedish defenders who had previously done so well to contain her. She crouched slightly, attempting to direct her header just underneath the crossbar. Instead, she struck it.Wiegman turned to her mercurial winger, Shanice van de Sanden, whose introduction was welcomed by those wearing orange in the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, her club stadium. In the final minute of regulation time, Van de Sanden was presented with a chance to spare us all another 30 minutes. Hedvig Lindahl, Sweden’s goalkeeper, tipped a rising shot over.Sembrant and Vivianne Miedema tussle for possession (Getty)The Netherlands were now at least building attacks better, having largely nullified Sweden’s early threat. What the contest needed now was someone, anyone, to make a difference. As the clock crept into three figures, up stepped Groenen, reacting fastest to Danielle van de Donk’s deflected pass and from 20 yards out, drilling low and hard into the far corner.If that is the sum total of the Dutch’s end product on Sunday, the United States will almost certainly win a fourth Women’s World Cup, retaining their 2015 title. But as Groenen demonstrated, sometimes one moment is all that it takes.The latest football headlines direct to your inboxThe latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

We are still on the train and have been told that we are understandably going to be here for some time.We can see a large number of emergency service vehicles at the scene.The Rail Accident Investigation Branch have been notied.A spokesman said: We are aware of an incident between Port Talbot and Pyle.

Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An emergency Budget. Huge sums found to keep certain industries afloat. Civil service holidays scrapped.Hunt, though, is unlikely to become PM. Andhe does we doubt even he believes he would preside over No Deal.Boris Johnson is more likely to do both — and must have a similar strategy. It was crazy that Mrs May did not.Today Dominic Grieve’s bid to block No Deal by threatening to inflict ­poverty on millions may be put to a vote. Labour may back it. Good luck explaining that to pensioners and those on benefits.No Deal remains the fallback. Let’s be as ready as we can.SIR Clf Richard and DJ Paul Gambaccini are innocent men who were ly accused and shamefully treated by the police and the BBC.But they are wrong to demand ­anonymity until charge for suspected sex offenders.Had paedophile TV star Stuart Hall not been named on his arrest he might have swatted away the three claims against him and lived on as a national treasure. Publicity triggered a flood of new accusations, proving a pattern of behaviour.Likewise for cab rapist John Worboys.We greatly sympathise with Clf and Paul. But the answer must not be an affront to open justice which risks the guilty getting away with crimes.It is for police to be less credulous as they sort fantasists from victims, to charge or clear suspects far more ­rapidly and to punish all  accusers.Secrecy is not the solution.LABOUR’S limitless self-harm continues.Taxing children for parental gts is a sucker punch for young middle-class urban Remainers — rapidly becoming Labour’s core vote — who rely on mum and dad to help them buy or rent.And the working class face punishment too. The pensions of , ex-miners, British Coal and British Steel workers will be trashed by Labour’s cut-price nationalisation of the private utilities they’re invested in.Labour detests the rich. But their politics of envy now alienate all classes.Oh, and Leavers. And Remainers.No wonder they’re nose-ing in the polls.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it was all a stunt for the papers.Sarah was a nanny and looked after the children of wealthy couples. Often she would work odd hours and stay overnight caring for the children so Id take in parcels for her.Sarah has vowed she will never settle for having just one partner again — and has instead ed head first into the kinky world of sex fetish parties.She has now sworn off monogamy – after her marriage to the man she wed on their first date ended in under two months.Sarah, who is now dating TWO toyboys, matched with husband Paul Edwards on dating app Bumble in December .Ten days later they met for the first time at Gatwick Airport and flew to Las Vegas to get hitched over Christmas.But it’s not all doom and gloom for Sarah. She says: “My marriage may be over but it has opened me up to a whole new world.“I no longer believe monogamy and marriage is the be-all and end-all.“Now I’m living the polyamorous lestyle and loving it.“My rainbow hair is the embodiment of the new me — strong, confident and ready for whatever the weather.”The couple’s split did not come as a surprise to Sarah’s family and friends, who always thought she was “bonkers” for marrying someone she had never met before.And Sarah confessed it was not exactly lust at first sight.She says: “I wasn’t initially attracted to Paul. But he seemed laid-back and nice and I was swept away in the moment.”The pair celebrated their honeymoon by buying each other private lap dances at a strip club.Sarah, who loves being a dominatrix, thought she had finally met someone who could keep up with her high sex drive.“It was great,” she recalls. “I love kinky parties and role playing and although Paul was not au fait with that world, he was open to it.“I thought I’d met my match, in and out of the bedroom.”Once back in the UK, Paul, , who was training to be an electrician, moved from Chichester, West Sussex, into Sarah’s home in Crowborough, East Sussex, which she shared with her two exes — also called Paul.Sarah says: “At first all three Pauls got on well. We were one big, happy, albeit unusual, family.“But my husband was very jealous of one of my Pauls, who I’d had a long-term relationship with and who shared the mortgage.”A week after husband Paul moved in, Sarah claims he started a row with her and her two Pauls.She says: “Everyone was getting on well. We were playing a board game and chilling out together at home.“But Paul got funny because I was apparently sitting two inches closer to my ex on the sofa.“He accused me of still being in love with him.“After that night the atmosphere turned sour and both ex Pauls started to hide in their rooms. It should have been a huge red flag.”“I understood my Paul’s fears as it was a weird set-up.“I’d sometimes be with my ex in his room, comforting him, but leaving the door open to appease my husband.“But Paul would storm in and accuse me of sleeping with Paul.”In an attempt to get their relationship back on track, Sarah says, the couple got dressed up in kinky gear for a night out at sex fetish party Torture Garden.Unsurprisingly, it did not do the trick. Sarah says: “Paul was a fish out of water.“Guys were coming up to me just to say ‘Hi’ and he would get all jealous and put his arm around me asto say, ‘She’s mine’.“Shortly after, we went to a gay night at a club in Brighton.“I was chatting to a gay couple at the bar. They were being flirty, flamboyant and fabulous and pushed a lollipop in my face and said, ‘Do you want a suck babe ’.“Jokingly, I obliged then gave one a cheeky kiss on the lips. Paul went absolutely mental and said I’d cheated on him.“He followed me around the whole night and watched me like a hawk.“I felt conned, like he had sold me a version of himself that wasn’t real.“As I became less attracted to him, our sex le dwindled.“He also got a man cold and was moaning all the time. It wasn’t sexy at all.”In February, Sarah says she asked Paul to move out as the rows were getting her down.But determined to prove the doubters wrong, Sarah decided to try to give their relationship another go. She says: “I knew people would say, ‘I told you so’, which was hard to swallow.“We were married and I took those vows seriously. I still wanted to make it work.”Later that month, they met for a romantic dinner. A few days after, Sarah says Paul invited her to a swingers’ night at club Le Boudoir in central London.She continues: “We were having a good night and were both chatting to a couple.“Paul fancied the girl and the pair started kissing. It didn’t bother me as, you know, we were in a swinging club, and I kissed her too.“But then her boyfriend stuck his hand up my skirt and grabbed me and I thought, ‘This is not cool’.“So I left the circle and went to get a drink.“Paul was annoyed as I’d ruined his chances with the girl and started another big row.”After a failed attempt at couples’ counselling, the pair split for good — days before their two-month anniversary.And as Paul left Sarah’s flat for the final time, he took one of Sarah’s Pauls with him.“That really upset me,” recalls Sarah. “He got that Paul to move in somewhere . It wasn’t the ex he was really jealous of, it was my other ex, whom I dated for a while.“It was really tough. I’d lost one of my jobs as a nanny and now I was going to lose the £ a month rent from that Paul.”It was then that Sarah says she decided to REALLY throw herself into the kink and sex fetish community.She says: “I became obsessed. I started going to a dferent BDSM event every week.“I lost all my mates when I married Paul, so now all my new friends are at these events.”In May she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and matched with a -year-old toyboy who works in the City of London.“He told me he was polyamorous,” she says. “We got on so well and his unconventional lestyle made sense.“He sees other women and I have recently met another -year-old guy who works in IT. It’s amazing, we all go to kink events together.“I dress them up in whatever outfits I want and I am their dom.“I dressed one up as a ballet dancer the other day.“They don’t get jealous of each other and we always ask permission first before getting with someone .“After feeling trapped in a jealous marriage it has really put me off being with one man again.”Laughing, she adds: “I’d love three boyfriends. It’s a good number.“I’ve got another date next week and I am very excited about it.” She says: “Despite everything, I don’t regret my relationship with Paul because I have learnt so much about myself and I’m much stronger and confident now.“But I am never dating another Paul again . . . it’s a rubbish name anyway.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house. Impress upon them that legs are useful things and might be funthey employed them once in a while.And for the rest of us: Walk, run, cycle. , paces per day minimum, or you’ll end up like Jabba The Hutt.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games. Do you like whack-a-mole or are you more of an apple bobber, plunging your head into a barrel of cold water to try to bite an elusive Granny Smith Bouncy castles, face-painting, white-elephant stalls, the suggestive-carrots display, guess-the--of-the-sausage-dog or the dreaded bric-a-brac stall: These are the daft indulgences of the British summer. Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop. It’s not a bad definition of Britishness: Have you ever been to a fête Certain rules apply.RULE ONE: At least one lady on the organising committee shall be called Peggy or Alison.RULE TWO: The trestle tables at the tea stall shall wobble alarmingly, but never quite collapse.RULE THREE: The home-made chocolate eclairs shall start to melt in the cakes tent.RULE FOUR: The PA system operated by the master of ceremoniesshall be prey to random bursts of deafening feedback.RULE FIVE: Evenit rains, everyone will totter home happy.Foreigners often find us hard to understand. At present they are baffled that our Government may soon be led by crumpled, grunting Boris Johnson, and that his opponent will be rambling revolutionary Jeremy Corbyn, an OAP who likes shell-suits and municipal manhole covers.Global diplomats and analysts pore over the socio-economic data, the pollsters’ pie charts, the tax statistics and more, and they puzzle.Likewise, they behold the weekly argy-bargy of Prime Minister’s Questions, or the sight of Nigel Farage and his merry MEPs turning their backs on the EU anthem at the opening of the European Parliament, and they are flummoxed. Brexit bamboozles them — “But why do you wish to leave our European Union ” They really don’t get it.My advice to our foreign friends is this: Follow the bunting and get yourself to a neighbourhood summer beano.Visit a fête and you will soon understand the British character. Bloody-minded,  quirky, unassuming, unfazed about politically-correct crazes.Fêtes are a telling combination of romantic tradition and anarchy. No one wants them to be slickly modern.We want our fêtes to be small-c conservative: The canvas marquee to smell as it did  years ago, the skittles lane to be surrounded by no more health and safety paraphernalia than a few straw bales, and at least one of the domestic-produce judges to become squfy after sampling the home-made sloe gins.At our village in Herefordshire it is always my job to supervise the dog show. In the parade ring things iniably unravel. We have had fights and attempted matings .One year a lad aged  about six entered the ring with a Great Dane twice his size. The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In a desperate bid to appeal to Conservative grassroots, the Foreign Secretary voiced his support for the cruel sport which has been banned in England in Wales for nearly  years. He said it was part of the countryside’s “heritage” and should be legalised. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: Labour proudly banned this barbaric practice. This Tory leadership race is going from bad to worse. And Mr Huntaposs surprise intervention will trigger dismay among Tory modernisers, who hoped he was the candidate to quell Boris Johnsonaposs lurch to the right. Sources stressed he would only seek to bring a free vote to the Commons – where MPs vote according to their consciences –there was a majority in Westminster for such a view.  Mr Hunt told the : “I donapost hunt myself, itaposs not particularly my thing. “I think we have to recognise itaposs part of the countryside and I think we have to recognise that, in terms of the balance of the countryside, itaposs part of our heritage. “So personally Iaposm happy for people to do it. He confirmed a commitment to have a vote in Parliament would be in the next Tory manesto,he was PM. In reality, such a situation is highly unlikely, with the overwhelming majority of MPs fiercely opposed to a reintroduction of the bloodsport.  However, Mr Huntaposs vocal display of support for hounds ripping apart foxes risks derailing his No bid. Theresa Mayaposs confession to the Mirror during the snap  general election that she had always backed the rural past-time was widely blamed for fuelling her ballot box humiliation. She said then: As it happens, personally I have always been in favour of fox hunting and we maintain our commitment - we have had a commitment previously as a Conservative Party - to allow a free vote. And thataposs what it will allow, would allow, Parliament the opportunity to take a decision on this. Polls consistently show around three-quarters or more of Britons are against bringing back the bloodsport.    Traditional hunts now follow a scent trail instead of a fox, or work around loopholes in the law. Countryside campaigners repeatedly demand a shake-up, effectively repealing the  Hunting Act. Mrs May’s predecessor David Cameron also promised Parliament a vote on repeal but had to scrap it after the SNP vowed to block it, even though it does not apply to Scotland.  Chris Luffingham, League Against Cruel Sports director of campaigns, hit back at Mr Huntaposs comments and suggested they could be damaging to his chances in a general election. “The last time a politician said we should bring back hunting - Theresa May in the  General Election – they were punished in the polling booths, he said. “Nothing has changed. “The vast majority of the British public will be horried by any attempt to revert back to the barbaric activity of fox hunting.    “The Hunting Act needs to be strengthened, not repealed, as the hunts are currently still getting away with chasing and killing British wildle. “Hunting needs to be consigned to the history books, and this decision shows quite how out of touch with public opinion Jeremy Hunt is. “Fox hunting is a brutal nasty activity in which the hounds literally tear apart the foxes – this should have no place in a modern compassionate society.” Labour Party Chairman Ian Lavery added: This Tory leadership race is going from bad to worse. “We’ve had Johnson’s tax cuts for the wealthy, a race to the bottom on no-deal Brexit , and now a pledge to bring back this barbaric practice that Labour had proudly banned. Animal Equality executive director Toni Vernelli said: “Jeremy Hunt has a very short memory – It was this same pledge that lost Theresa May the youth vote at the last election. “Hunting with dogs is a cruel relic of the past. “Britain has long moved on from finding animal abuse entertaining, and Jeremy Hunt is living in a cavehe hasn’t noticed this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mp accuses dwp incompetence cover","story":"NewsMP accuses DWP of incompetence or cover-up over benefit claimants deathsDebbie Abrahams blasted missing documents in a row over people who died after being subject to a fit-for-work testShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsDebbie Abrahams attacked the Department for Work and Pensions\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Labour MP has accused the government of incompetence or cover-up over the way it handled benefit claimantsapos deaths.

The DWP finally replied this week - but said it was too late to know for sure and documents may have been destroyed.    In a letter to the campaigning MP, DWP minister Justin Tomlinson said the government shared all relevant information which was requested by the review team. But he said it was up to the reviewers, not the DWP, to decide what documents they wanted to request. He added: The [DWP] would therefore not routinely share private information on claimant cases. Ms Abrahams blasted the reply, telling MPs: Weaposre talking about the circumstances of peopleaposs deaths about five years ago. To tell me these documents canapost be found smacks at least of incompetence and at worst of a cover-up. Raising a point of order in the House of Commons, Ms Abrahams said the DWP must ensure it keeps proper records and reports and investigate the missing documents. She also demanded an in dependent inquiry into all deaths linked to the governmentaposs social security reforms. Deputy Commons Speaker Eleanor Laing said it was an extremely important matter - one literally of le and death.  In his letter, Mr Tomlinson confirmed the DWP has carried out  internal process reviews into inidual benefit cases since . Circumstances that can trigger a probe include investigating whether there was any link to the DWP in a benefit claimantaposs death. But the Tory minister claimed it would not be right to publish them because they contain personal information. He added not all relate to fit-for-work tests, which have been undergone by millions of people claiming sickness and disability benefit Employment and Support Allowance. Mr Tomlinson said DWP officials had run a robust and thorough search to checkdocuments were shared with Dr Litchfield.  But he said: Due to theof time since the reviews were carried out, factors such as document retention policies, organisational changes and staff turnover mean that information that might help answer these queries is no longer available. Therefore, as the information is no longer held by the department, we are unable to comment on this issue any further. He added: The [DWP] does not hold or collect data on the reason for death for benefit claimants. Whilst any death is extremely distressing for the family, no causal link can be made between the likelihood of dying and the fact that someone is claiming benefits.

Friday  June: Boris Johnson domestic row The race explodes as police are called to the home Boris Johnson shares with girlfriend Carrie Symonds amid a domestic row. He surfaces on Saturday but refuses to answer questions about the incident. Headlines continue for days.  June -  July: Hustings by members  The Toriesapos , members spend a month deciding who will lead their party - and thus be Prime Minister. Members take part in a postal ballot, with a nationwide tour and several hustings by the candidates expected. There is no electronic voting. DATES TBC: BBC TV debates  The BBC announced plans for several debates. The final two candidates would be invited to put their cases to a studio audience in a special edition of BBC Question Time, hosted by Fiona Bruce. The same two would also be each invited to a one-on-one interview with Rottweiler interviewer Andrew Neil. Two separate shows would be broadcast, one for each candidate. However, allies of Boris Johnson appeared reluctant to take part in a wider debate before the field is knocked down to two people. Monday  July  Sky TV debate  Sky News was organising a live head-to-head debate between the final two candidates, hosted by Kay Burley. It would take place in front of a live studio audience of Conservative voters, who decide the contest. But it was postponed from June  after Boris Johnson failed to take part. Tuesday  July: ITV TV debate  Julie Etchingham is expected to host a debate ITV debate on  July. It would be a head to head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt and itaposs thought both have agreed in principle. An ITV spokesperson said: ITV will provide coverage across both TV and online, with ITV News’ journalists scrutinising the candidates for Conservative leader, getting answers to the questions that matter. Our plans will include both a head to head debate and interviews, as well as trusted impartial analysis across our ITV news bulletins. Further details of our plans will be announced in due course. Tuesday  July: Next Prime Minister confirmed  The next Prime Minister was expected to be announced in the week of Monday  July. Once the winner is confirmed by the Conservative Party, the process of being installed in  Downing Street would happen quickly. All it takes is for Theresa May to end her lame duck term by visiting the Queen and formally telling the Monarch she is handing in her resignation. Minutes later, her successor could be expected to be called to Buckingham Palace, where the Queen would ask him or her to form a government. What next  Cabinet reshuffle, Brexit plans - and a possible general election  The next Prime Minister can be expected to carry out a major Cabinet reshuffle after years of resignations under Theresa May. Many of those who quit in protest at her Brexit deal can be expected to make a comeback, especiallya Brexiteer ally wins power. This would be the first step towards dramatically re-shaping the UKaposs Brexit plan. Expect the next PM to seize the opportunity of August - a quiet time with MPs and the EU on holiday - to draw up new plans behind closed doors and prepare for fresh clashes with Brussels. Parliament s in the first week of September, at which point the new PM would hold their first PMQs . This would be the ideal moment to begin a legal process towards either making a drastically dferent Brexit deal or crashing out with no deal at all. The next PM makes their first address to the Conservative Party Conference on October , just  days before the Halloween deadline for leaving the EU. But thereaposs a catch. Deadlock in Parliament could force the next Prime Minister to call a general election. Or worse, they could have one thrust upon them through a vote of no confidence in HM Government. Pro-EU Tories have warned  of their MPs are willing to back a no confidence vote to stop No Deal. That would be enough to trigger a general election just weeks into the new Prime Ministeraposs term. Labour could even theoretically hold a no-confidence vote on the new PMaposs first full day in office, Thursday  July. But itaposll have to be a snap decision - asthey donapost force a vote then, itaposll have to wait until Parliamentaposs summer holiday is over in September.

Grandmother-of-three and great gran-of-two Mary Emerson has been making them most of her le. But the -year-old says as she has grown older she does nip into bakery chain Greggs to get her fix. She said: “I’ve enjoyed baking for as long as I can remember and everyone has always enjoyed my sausage rolls. “I still enjoy making them, with a little help. One of my favourite times to make them is Christmas with my granddaughter, Naomi.” She said the key to a perfect sausage roll is good quality sausage meat and cutting them up small.    Mary said: “Although my eyesight is poor and I have the odd niggle, I still try to make sausage rolls as they go down so well. “That and staying positive has been the secret to a long le.” Mary was thrown a surprise birthday by her local Greggs bakers for her birthday on Sunday.

David Baker and Carol McCann, both , were spotted inside a grey coloured car parked up at Northern Cricket club in Great Crosby on a spring afternoon. Despite insisting they were actually just clearing up some spilt Coke, they were later charged with outraging public decency by having sex in view of the public.  Baker, from Southport, and McCann, from Crosby, both pleaded guilty during a hearing at Sefton Magistrates today, reports the Liverpool Echo. They instead described a series of unfortunate events, involving a can of coke, which led to them being found in the position. Prosecutor Sarah Egan told the court how the mum and daughter noticed Baker aposnaked, and facing the rear of the car.apos    Baker was moving aposback and forwardapos and there was a woman below him. The mumaposs -year-old daughter said to her: Mum, are they doing what I think they are doing  The mum then approached the car with a second adult, which was in the overflow car park at Northern Cricket club. As they approached the car one of the women said to Baker and McCann: What do you think you are doing  Ms Egan said: At this point Mr Baker pulled up his trousers. Ms McCann made no effort to put her clothes on. The two women took a photograph of the couple in the car. The incident happened at around .pm on April  this year. Ms McCann, a dinner lady from Crosby, told the police that Baker had spilt a can of coke over her and that  she had been trying to change her clothes.    She told police that although she was topless she had her knickers on. The court heard that the couple had known each other in their youth but bumped into each other at Goodison Park. On the day of the incident McCann had picked up Baker, who was married, at Blundellsands station. They were planning on driving to Formby. Nick Archer, who defended Baker, said that although his client admitted the offence he did not have sex with McCann in the car. He explained how when Baker opened a can of Coke in the car it went all over McCann. Baker had spare clothes and decided to use the overflow car park at Northern Cricket club to get changed.    But when she started to get changed aposone thing led to another.apos Mr Archer said that although the witnesses thought the couple were having sex this was not the case. He said: It may have looked like it, but it was not actual sex. Mr Bakeraposs Coke had gone everywhere in the car. She knew there was an overflow carpark at the cricket club. It was a safe place for her to get changed.  But due to an event on that day, people decided to use the carpark. It was a number of coincidences. One thing led to another, but it was short of intercourse.Obviously my client is full of shame and embarrassment He has had to explain it to his family. Joe Woodyett, defending McCann, said that she did not have sex with Baker on the day of the incident - but that she was ashamed and sorry for what happened. Sefton Magistrates ordered Baker and McCann to do  hours unpaid work each. They were each ordered to pay £ in costs and a victim surcharge of £.

After years of waiting, victims of an alleged multi-million pound land banking scam were seeing the key player give evidence. Baron Deschauer ran a web of companies which bought greenbelt fields and ided them into housing-sized plots which were sold to investors. Buyers claim that they were told that the value would rocket ten-fold when the sites got planning permission but it hasn’t been granted and the land is effectively worthless. Many bought their plots as long ago as  and the Glenridge Estates group of companies that sold them have been shut down and their funds have disappeared overseas. Now another Deschauer company, Guernsey-incorporated Terracorp Limited, is suing them for even more money. When investors bought plots they signed covenants to pay an annual charge, which they claim they believed would pay for roads and utilities for the housing estates. Many are now being taken to court after they stopped paying the charges because, without planning permission, no work has started on any of the sites.  The defendants claim that Canadian-born Deschauer, , and his sales reps tricked them into signing deals by suggesting that planning permission for housing would be obtained within three to five years. Deschauer told the High Court in London this week that he later came to the conclusion that his star salesman, named as Jay Sandhu, was a “rogue agent” with “a fluid morality” and “the ability to persuade himself that black is white and vice versa”. However he insisted that no promises were made about the likelihood or timing of planning permission being granted. “I sub-ided land and sold off the freehold, what people wanted to do with that land was purely up to them,” he told the court. His barrister Andrew Maguire asked investors who gave evidence about the clause in the contract that said no planning promises were being made. Witnesses responded that they were given little time to read the contracts following high pressure sales tactics, often signing the agreements while sitting in the sales rep’s car on site, and were given verbal assurances that planning would be granted. Family doctor Jagdish Chavda from Leigh on Sea, Essex, bought two plots near Reigate, Surrey, for £, and has since paid more than £, in covenant fees. He said the sales rep “certainly did not warn us that there would be any doubt or risk in obtaining planning permission”, and “failed to tell us that the location was in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and that there were current planning restrictions.” Airline supply manager Mohammad Chaudhry and his family bought three plots at Bourne End, Bucks, for £, each. “Planning permission was described in terms that made it sound like a mere formality,” he said in a witness statement. “It was not explained that we would have to pay covenant charges as a perpetual charge irrespective of whether planning permission was granted.”  Yash Pal Gogna and his family bought five plots at Newark, Notts, through sales agent Jay Sandhu in . “He said they were selling fast, you need to sign today, they will be gone tomorrow,” Mr Gogna told the court. He said they were doing four year interest free credit, you have nothing to lose. Mr Gogna said he skimmed through the contract he was shown: I did not know at the time what covenant meant. He said it was a maintenance charge and it would only be paid for four years. He stopped paying the covenant charge in  because at that stage I realised I had been the victim of a fraudulent landbanking scheme. We were told lies and believed the lies. When Deschaueraposs barrister suggested that he must have been aware of the risk of a salesman “getting beyond himself”, he replied: “No, Iaposd never come across a fraudulent salesman before.” Oumeima Ben Youssef, a radiographer from Gillingham, Kent, bought three plots at nearby Bluebell Hill for £, and has since paid nearly £, in covenant charges. Her witness statement read: “Deschauer and his ious companies were all aware, or should have been, that the plots were sold to me without the remotest possibility of planning.” Barrister Helen Swaffield, representing the investors, told Mr Deschauer: “The reason people do not want to pay your covenant charges is because it’s a scam, and having already paid for a worthless plot they do not want to throw good money after bad.” He replied: “I do not believe it’s a scam.” She asked him: “In the last  years since running these sites have any of them got planning permission  Deschauer responded: “None.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle harry refusing reveal","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry refusing to reveal godparents but here are  contendersThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be making public the identity of son Archies godparents - attracting further criticism after funding renovations with tax payers moneyShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  JUL NewsBookmakers are taking bets on the likeliest candidates to be Archies godparents \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have decided they wonapost be revealing the identity of Archieaposs godparents - but that wonapost stop speculation as to who it might be.

Dean Coleman, , was already serving a suspended sentence for assaulting Holly Parker. But, having agreed to give her a le to pick up a parcel, he left her terried by driving erratically and threatening to smash into a tree. The thug later turned up at her home and circled it for an hour. Then, as she waited for police to arrive, he attacked her with a hammer aiming blows at her head which she managed to block with her hand which was broken in the attack.A court heard Coleman snatched Miss Parkeraposs beloved dog, spray-painted vile abuse on and around her home and caused hundreds of pounds of damage, reports Chronicle Live .Coleman, from Swalwell in Gateshead, Newcastle, was branded a danger and locked up for four years with an extended licence period of a year. Miss Parker said she feared she would die while a judge said he had shown insight by saying he behaved like a monster.    Newcastle Crown Court heard the pair were in a four month relationship in  but Coleman had assaulted her and caused criminal damage, leading to him receiving a suspended prison sentence and a restraining order last year. Having ceased contact, Miss Parker got back in touch with him for a time but then stopped again due to his behaviour. However, on December  last year she needed to collect a parcel and, as she doesnapost drive, he agreed to take her to pick it up. But on the way back to her home in Whickham, she said his demeanour changed and he started driving erratically and at high speed, almost hitting a pedestrian. Nick Lane, prosecuting, said: She thought the driving was intended to scare her as she had recently lost her friend in a car accident. He began to question why she had not been in contact with him properly and he became very angry. He threatened to drive at high speed into a tree and she began to cry, shouting that she didnapost want to die. Coleman drove around for at least  minutes before she seized an opportunity on Coatsworth Road, Gateshead, to jump out of his van when it came to a stop. She ran through back lanes for five to  minutes to try to get away, stopping to hide behind a wall when she spotted him. Miss Parker rang a taxi to collect her to take her home and she got there about pm - but within five minutes she saw Coleman drive past in his van before ing and parking outside. He went round the back of her house, which he circled for around an hour, leaving her afraid when she heard smashing noises. When she saw him break some glass in a window next to the front door, she called .    The court heard she told him the police were on their way, to which he responded: If thataposs the case I might as well come and get you. Mr Lane said: Within moments she could see him moving across the street towards her. He grabbed her by the hair, kneed her in the face, pushed her to the ground and he hit and kicked her to the body while she was on the ground. She got up and he pushed her into ceramic bird bath in the garden, causing her to fall on her side. Miss Parker ran towards her neighbours home, shouting for help and banging on the door. Mr Lane said: While she was trying to get help, the defendant ran towards her with a hammer in his hand and was waving it above his head. She lted her arm to protect herself and he hit her seven times with the hammer. She describes each blow connecting with full force on one or both of her arms. He shouted at her to get in his van and she screamed at him to stop. She said the blows were aimed at her head but hit her hands as she was using them to protect herself. She describes being petried and fearing he was going to kill her. Eventually, a neighbour opened his door and she ran inside to safety and rang the police again. Officers turned up at .pm and found the front door had been damaged and the word s**g had been repeatedly spray-painted on the pavement and brick work of her house. Miss Parker also noticed her pet dog was missing. She asked her mum to text Coleman askinghe knew where the dog was and he replied suggesting he had the dog and would kill itthe police were contacted. He had also gone back in and smashed two televisions, the court heard.    Miss Parker was taken to hospital and was found to have a broken left hand, bruising and swelling to both arms and cuts and bruises to her her leg. Her Fitbit watch was also damaged. The total cost of the damage done to the house was £, the court heard. When Coleman was arrested, the dog was found in his possession. In interview, he gave some bizarre answers, initially admitting the attack, then saying he had chopped off her head with a machete and pulled her brains out, then claiming he had been in Benidorm at the time and said the victim was horrible and called her a compulsive liar. Miss Parker said in a victim impact statement: I thought he was going to kill me, I thought I was going to die. Iaposve never seen him like that, he really scared me, like something took over him. She said she felt ashamed for giving him another chance after the first assault, adding: I feel humiliated by the attack and I feel embarrassed that after a previous assault I was stupid enough to think he had changed and to even think about giving him another chance. I believed him when he said he loved me and promised to be dferent. She continued: He was hitting me with a hammer when he was really angry so I feel itaposs only luck my arms took all of the force as I desperately tried to protect my head. If any of the blows hit my head, I might not have survived. Roofer Coleman, who has seven previous convictions, pleaded guilty to GBH, burglary, possessing an offensive weapon, breaching a restraining order, two counts of criminal damage and breaching the suspended sentence. Judge Robert Spragg jailed him for four years with an extended licence period of a further year as part of an extended sentence after branding him dangerous. He was also given an indefinite restraining order. Referring to a pre-sentence report, the judge told Coleman: You have shown some insight, referring to yourself as a monster for what you have done. Paul Caulfield, defending, said: His instructions are at that particular time he was in a very dark place mentally and emotionally. He expresses through me his remorse for his conduct. He bitterly regrets what he did. Mr Caulfield said Coleman had glowing testimonials from prison.

Gwen Lamb was forced to fork out £ in dental bills after one of her teeth was chipped and another fell out following the bakery incident. The Middlesborough woman accidentally bit into the ring of the cupcake which she mistook for icing.Gwen contacted the bakers who offered her a gt voucher, Chronicle Live reported.She turned the gesture down, instead demanding that they pay her dental bills and for her phone calls to the dentist.    Gwen won the battle, but now she wants the sausage roll specialists to improve its safety measures. She said: I am very pleased that in the end Greggs has done the honourable thing and refunded me. This happened on April  and it has taken a long time for them to do the right thing. The real icing on the cake would bethey changed the tops of the cakes to icing. The tooth based trauma began when Gwen bought the cup cake from a Greggs in Newcastle just before Easter.    Ever since she has been beating the drum for ring-free cupcakes from Greggs. They are a choking hazard, she said. They should make staff warn customers when they buy a cake it is a toy ring, or they should just ice the middle of the cake. Rings are not meant to be bought in bakeries.    A spokesperson for Greggs said the company has been in regular contact with Gwen about the issue. They added: We have clear warnings inside our shops and also on our packaging to advise customers that all toys and decorations are non-edible. A gesture of good will has been offered and we really hope the customer will visit us again soon.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan harry have less money","story":"NewsMeghan and Harry have less money and far fewer staff than Kate and WilliamEven the Duke and Duchess of Sussex face \"financial restrictions\"ShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video say-what-prince-harry-just-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Unless youaposve been living under a rock recently , then you may have caught wind of the scrutiny the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs spending has come under.

Margarita Grachyova, , was forced into a car by partner -year-old Dimitry Grachyov and driven to a forest where he forced her to kneel before the horric attack. The psychologist carried out the vicious act in December  after becoming convinced she was having an affair. Now he is serving a -year jail sentence and she is determined to look sexy again after posing for glamour pictures in her native Russia. Margarita - or Rita - has won admirers around the world for the “inspirational” way she has rebuilt her le after the brutal attack. One hand was sewn back on - giving her limited use. The other was too badly damaged and she had an articial limb attached leading her young sons to call her “transformer mum”.    Posting her new pictures, she asked her social media followers: aposSexuality - how does it manest itself  “Right after the tragedy of  December , it seemed to me, and I sometimes still think so now, that I am no longer attractive. “Before I was a girl without any defects. “But I turned into a girl with no hand - and lots of scars on my left arm and leg. “To be honest, I have not learned to accept myself as I am. “Sometimes I am very upset and annoyed that my left hand looks chubby and blue from scars. “And the black prosthesis - it doesnapost really match a blue dress…. aposAnd when I wear a short skirt, four huge scars are visible on my leg. aposBut sexuality is not only the look, theof legs, and hair. “It is something deeper, something inside.”   She won thousands of likes for her postings on Instagram and Russian social media VK.Her profile reads: “Transformer-mum, two sons and a cat. Everything is in your hands evenyou have only one.” Saying she is now single after starting orce proceedings against her jailed husband, she confessed: “I am not giving up on a private le, but I have slightly dferent priorities now.” Margarita has learned to e and said: “I want to jump with a parachute but have not done so yet.” She is also writing a book on domestic violence - based on her own experiences - along with her journalist mother. “I hope that some girl will read it and leave her tyrant husband,” she said, arguing her experience can be a warning to other women. She won a string of admitting comments for her pictures. “You are so pretty, I sincerely admire you,” said one. Another posted: “Well done, Rita! Great happiness in le!” Her husband was jailed after a court case in Serpukhov, near Moscow, in which she cross-examined him. “No verdict willmy hands,” she said after the November case. And no [jail] term will. “I will have to live with it for the rest of my le.”    He showed “no remorse”, said Margarita, who denied she was unfaithful to her husband. Margarita’s left hand was sewn back on by surgeons, and she now has a “robot” right arm which she is learning to use as she rebuilds her le and cares for the couple’s two sons. Grachyov was found guilty by judge Irina Pantela of threatening his we with murder, kidnap, and causing her serious physical harm. Earlier he was stripped of his rights to raise the couple’s children. He told the court gruesome details of how he severed her hands after dragging her out of his car. “I wrapped ropes around her arms, next to her shoulders, in two places,” he said. He forced her to kneel and admitted his terror-stricken we was “screaming” and begging him not to dismember her. “As I was chopping her hands she didn’t try to run away. “She just fell down. “I dragged her to the car.

At hospital I went through security gate and screamed that they had to take her from the car. “I helped to put her on the trolley.” She earlier told how Grachyov was “totally calm” when he axed her hands. “Unfortunately, I felt all the pain very much. I was dreaming that I would faint. “I kept thinking all the time, why am I not fainting  “When he raised his axe, I just closed my eyes, I didn’t look at it….

So the pair decided to leave their jobs, sell their house and take their two daughters, Isla, , and Madeleine, , on the trip of a letime.Speaking to the Tele, Gillian said: #His job requires him to be away from home regularly and he wasn#t seeing the kids growing up. We just didn#t want him to miss out.# The family, who live in Kellas, kicked off their travels in Iceland before coming back and doing two house sits while Andy worked abroad. Then they made a fleeting visit to Portugal before taking a road trip around Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro # all whilst homeschooling the girls on the go. But the travelling didn#t stop there # since the start of the year the family has also visited the US, Costa Rica and Guatemala, amongst other destinations.And their time in America was pretty unforgettable as the pair decided to get hitched in Las Vegas, with their whole family flying out to join them for the celebrations.The couple had previously taken Isla travelling around south-east Asia when she was two years old and knew that it was something they#d definitely do again.Gillian said she was certain that it was one of the best decisions they had ever made.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy

It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour.

I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really.

As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully.

Itrsquos a testament to the continued interest in local heritage and tradition that it is as relevant in  as it was two centuries ago.Now in its th year, the annual Haddington Show will open its gates on Saturday to the crowds and showcase the finest producers, breeders and vendors from East Lothian.The show is a signicant event within the area, with traditional displays of animals, produce and crafts but also offering entertainment and attractions that appeal to contemporary audiences.Of course there is always the lsquoBest in Breedrsquo awards, where competition is fierce but friendly between cattle and sheep breeders, and judging is a serious affair.There are about  horse classes, from veteran riders to the horse and rider fancy dress. The number of entrants reflect the unmistakable popularity of equestrian pursuits within East Lothian.And for those who prefer more craft-based endeavours, there are numerous prizes for the craft schedules, including floristry, baking, stick dressing, photography and jam-making. Itrsquos certainly an inclusive event.Therersquos even a hugely popular vintage farm machinery section, a huge draw for farming and non-farming visitors alike and which makes an impressive vista across the showground.Butyou think itrsquos all about prize turnips and tractors, yoursquod be wrong. Such is the reputation of the Haddington Show it attracts some prestigious performers.One of the most sought-after tickets is for the remarkable pop-up opera shows: a touring version of Scottish Opera who perform in a mobile lorry, complete with seating and stage. Theyrsquoll be singing highlights from three operas during the show and tickets are on a first-come first-served basis on the day.Other notable entertainment is from the Broke FMX stunt motorbike team. Theyrsquoll be performing acrobatic stunts that will have the audience holding their breath as the UKrsquos top ranked freestyle motocross riders reach heights of  feet and jump gaps of almost  feet.For something a little less heart-stopping but no less thrilling, donrsquot miss The Drakes of Hazard. Marvel at the skill of Mark Wylie with his sheepdog and Indian runner duck display team as they navigate around obstacles, working in harmony ndash a lsquomust seersquo for the kids.And no Scottish agricultural show would be complete without a pipe band.The Haddington Show is pleased to welcome East Lothianrsquos own Haddington Pipe Band, a befitting soundtrack to this traditional event.Asall that entertainment isnrsquot enough, visitors can also sample and buy a range of locally produced goods in the East Lothian Producers Marquee. The very best produce from our area includes locally made oils, dairy goods, bread, spices and, of course, whisky!Another area not to be missed is the equally local Craft and Lestyle Marquee, where you can buy items made in East Lothian. Again, the choice is ied, definitely a lsquosomething for everyonersquo scenario and some unusual offerings like hand-knitted kidsrsquo clothing, candles, accessories madefrom feathers, tweed items and furniture ndash and thatrsquos just the edit! Allow plenty of time between the performances to browse the local marquees.The Haddington Show is a fabulous and educational day out for all ages but it doesnrsquot happen without the continued support of sponsors and traders, who also exhibit at the show.The two main sponsors for  are Greaves, West  Ayre, who have been generous sponsors since , and Lothian Broadband, who this year are also supporting the show, and both businesses will be in the sponsorsrsquo marquee by the main ring, along with many other local companies visitors are encouraged to meet the traders.No less recognition should be given to the committee who make the show possible. Throughout the year, they work tirelessly, and largely voluntary, to make the show a success. Co-ordinating the events, booking the entertainment and physically preparing the ground for the big day takes a huge effort.

It is due to begin in August and be completed in the autumn with the report going to the new PM.The Cabinet had been poised to discuss the Union at its regular Tuesday meeting but this was cancelled because Mrs May was waylaid in Brussels as EU leaders discussed the appointment of jobs to the new-look Commission. It is now expected the ldquoUnion Cabinet will take place next Tuesday.It is understood that there is a growing mood within Whitehall that, particularly with the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, that the Conservative Government has to do much more to strengthen the Union.Already, Scottish Conservative MPs have been pushing for more direct funding to Scotland to show voters how much the UK Government does to build and improve the nationrsquos infrastructure.

The one marked ldquoUnited Kingdom had been placed at the bottom of the pile. The new premier frowned, pulled it out and placed it right at the top.In the last few days, Mrs May has had to endure the sight of the two contenders rubbishing her approach to Brexit and dancing on the grave of her failed attempt to get Brexit through even though both of them backed her Withdrawal Agreement in the final Commons vote.Her speech on Thursday will be scanned for any nuance that can be interpreted as a put-down to one candidate or an endorsement of the other in other words, Boris for the former and Jeremy for the latter.No doubt, alarmed by the ldquodo or die rhetoric of Mr Johnson, Mrs Mayrsquos central message about strengthening the Union will be directed at her former Foreign Secretary. Watch out to seethere are any references to charging at the guns and the Valley of Death.In the last few days and, no doubt, in the next  hours before the Scottish hustings, the two would-be premiers will be busy burnishing their Unionist credentials.Just as there has been a bidding war on fiscal promises and on who can sound the hardest on a no-deal Brexit, so we can expect the two contenders to be trying to out-speak one another on who is the greater Unionist.Mr Hunt has already pronounced that he would support the Union with \"every drop of blood in my veins\". At Tuesdayrsquos Belfast hustings, when talk was of the backstop and borders, Mr Johnson declared the ldquoUnion comes first\" and was ldquoabsolutely inviolable.Both men have committed to introducing a Union Unit in No  to better co-ordinate the Unionist message across Government.With time so short before she goes, the PMrsquos attempt at legacy-building is dficultnot impossible. And yet this newspaper has been told that she will soon announce a review, possibly in her speech on Thursday in Scotland, to look at how the Government structures can be configured to strengthen the Union the very subject of her final address.The Conservative administration is due shortly to publish its response to the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee report on constitutional matters, which called for a review of the role of the Scottish Secretary and Scotland Office now that we are  years on from the start of devolution.While the Nationalists want the post and office abolished, some Unionists want them to be subsumed into a Department for the Union headed by the Deputy Prime Minister or First Secretary of State.But David Mundell has been, behind the scenes, battling to have the role enhanced. Indeed, there are suggestions the Scotland Office is going to be beefed up with a couple of new ministers as part of the underpinning of the Union.The Scottish Secretary is due to appear before the committee next week when he will doubtless expand on his vision for his office which, of course, might not include him depending on who wins the Conservative crown.Other signs of strengthening the Union are the UK Governmentrsquos new hub in Edinburgh, including a dedicated room to enable the UK Cabinet to hold some of its meetings there, and a push for more direct Whitehall funding of Scottish projects in devolved areas denounced as a ldquopower-grab by Edinburgh.One Unionist project, however, is unlikely to see the light of day: Mr Johnsonrsquos idea of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland.When asked about it, he insisted he was still supportive but noted diplomatically it was something for the Northern Irish Executive to take forward.

Scuttlebutt insists that the -year-old is nothing but a puppet, leaning on colleagues for support, mouthing their ideas, and too decrepit to do much more than clutch the lectern and issue an occasional rallying call to his troops.With most unfrail alacrity, Mr Corbyn has refuted all these suggestions ndash apparently made by senior civil servants ndash and is asking for an independent inquiry into whoever is spreading such lies. He is right to insist on this, but sadly the damage is already done. Now every blink and tremor, every hesitation and stumble, will be cause for analysis and concern.No-one beyond the Labour leaderrsquos closest family and associates can know how much,any, truth this gossip holds. Wersquove been told about eye problems, but are they an indication of more serious underlying health problems  Or is it simply that the burdens of office are exhausting him, making him appear older than his years  Impossible to tell. With a man whose demeanour has always been more energy-saving bulb than dynamo, it is dficult to detect any appreciable dimming of wattage.As questions were being asked about his ability to run the party, let alone turn the key in the door of Number , I found myself thinking of Mr Corbyn when watching democratic hopefuls for the next US presidential nomination. Bernie Saunders, who will be  in September, is impressively impassioned, but he cannot surely be anybodyrsquos idea of the perfect candidate, given the demands that would be made of him in arguably the most high-profile and pressured job in the world. Joe Biden, too, at  is scarcely a spring chicken. Like Mr Saunders, he was born while the Second World War was getting into gear. As for the American president, even his worst enemies have to concede that at  he still seems to be possessed of enough energy to make international deals and travel the globe, with never a sign of flagging.This might all sound unpleasantly ageist. Yet with a few notable exceptions, most mortals begin to slow down intellectually as well as physically as they reach their biblical span of three score years and . This is not to say that there are not many fruitful, useful and enjoyable years ahead, but it is to suggest that the gruelling schedules expected of modern politicians, be they first ministers or presidents, senators or MPs, is no longer an arena in which those past their prime will easily flourish. A century ago, there would have been little or no public outcry over an elderly or enfeebled prime minister or party leadercolleagues could keep the government on track. In this, Britain had the benefit of centuries of precedent with royalty. From before the Stuarts to George III, kings and queens, with a little help from friends at court, continued to pass edicts and legislation, sign death warrants and go to war, while, whether through ill health, insanity or senility, they were completely unfit for office.Read more: Labour demands probe into civil serviceWith the onward march of democracy, however, has come greater visibility, transparency and accountability. Technology might have transformed our domestic workload, but for those in the political front line, the digital revolution has turned night into day. Dedication and accessibility   is the least voters now expect. No wonder so many images of MPs shows them in running gear, pounding the pavements and turning strawberry pink. This is not just a metaphor but a practical necessitythey are to survive the punishing regime their role demands.Despite much talk about our fast-ageing population, there has never been a period that is so youth-driven, or when the old have been so easily and cruelly dismissed as irrelevant or past-it because they have one foot still in a pre-tech world. The gulf between those born while ration books were circulating, and those whorsquod mastered an iPhone before their milk teeth were cut, is eye-wateringly wide. What does someone of pensionable age understand of the Snapchat generation  Other than the most basic human needs, such as security, work, and dignity, which transcend any barriers of time and class, colour and creed, what can an elderly politician offer a youthful electorate Well, perhaps more than yoursquod think. Clearly, what wersquore witnessing with the ongoing popularity of those like Mr Saunders and Donald Trump, is the triumph of longevity and experience over vigour. Their retro appeal is in part thanks to a letimersquos accumulation of high-powered connections and skills. Why be surprised that some dream even now of Ken Clarke taking over the Tory Party to bring it to its senses, despite him being almost as ancient as the Fortingall yew  Or that others rejoice at the distant prospect of Ann Widdecombe resurrecting her political career and ing as a Brexit Party MP.Experience, and the informed perspective it allows, is by far the greatest advantage of seniority. Is this what the young see when they look at people like Mr Corbyn, who lavishes more care on his allotment than on clear-cut policy yet commands widespread respect and even affection or why the venerable-looking Mr Saunders made such an impression with his brand of democractic socialism that he threatened to make Hillary Clinton toast It would seem so. Evidence suggests, indeed, that despite living in a world designed for youth, where to be in any way incapacitated or slow is to be invisible and ignored, we are nevertheless hard-wired as humans to defer to age. Rightly or wrongly, our instincts tell us that with wrinkles or bald pate, dentures or dodgy knees, comes hard-won wisdom. You might even argue that, far from being a handicap to reaching power, advanced age is actually an asset."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-english-nationalism-demeans-our-politics","story":"English nationalism is not mentioned in Mr Smithrsquos column, but it is arguably the element which has driven Brexit and left the country in its present state of lemming-like idiocy. Is it not noticed by media commentators, because it has become so normalised and taken for granted  It does appear to be a signicant mote in Mr Smithrsquos eye and it greatly diminishes his arguments for a better style of politics.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.IT is a lovely idea that a kinder politics could flourish in Scotland rather than that which we have become accustomed to. Mark Smith points out that the remarkable victory of Ekrem Imamoglu as mayor of Istanbul was based on just such a strategy, having concluded that ldquoyou cannot fight polarising populists by being polarising.Those who have become hardened by the angry confrontation that so often accompanies exchanges over Scotlandrsquos constitutional future might think it naiumlve to imagine that we could get away from all that rancour, yet the Istanbul example shows otherwise. Turkish politics has after all suffered more than its fair share of isive and angry political struggles over the years.Personally, I believe one of the biggest turn-offs when it comes to considering future options for Scotland is the grievance-led narrative favoured by the SNP leadership. The challenge for those who value Scotlandrsquos positive place in the UK is to try to dfuse discord, and to emphasise the positives we share with family, friends, colleagues and fellow citizens across the UK. Many of the dferences that nationalists seek to exploit are short-term or exaggerated, whereas the advantages of being in the closest of possible unions have lasted over the course of many generations.Keith Howell, West Linton.RORY Stewart was right to be ldquoafraid of the word ldquolove in political discourse. All you need is love, said the Beatles, and that ended in an acid trip at Haight-Ashbury. Mark Smith seems to regard love as a political tool that might be utilised so that ldquowe might be able to take on popular movements that rely on national identity, such as Scottish nationalism. His particular brand of love does not seem to be universal. Who are ldquowe Tricky word, love. Professor William Barclay used to lecture us on prime-time telly, to the signature tune of Mendelssohnrsquos Scottish Symphony, on the dference between ldquoeros and ldquoagape . The trouble is that a lot of people who think they are in love are actually in a relationship of coercive abuse. The greatest act of love you can possibly bestow on a person about whom you are crazy, but who just isnrsquot right for you, is to let her go.Dr Hamish Maclaren, Stirling.MARK Smith comments on the positive nature of ldquolove in the political sphere. What he doesnrsquot say is the first proponent of inclusive political positivity was Alex Salmond in the  referendum, and who always referred to our big southern neighbour with complementary affection. Of course his objective was Scottish self-government and his opponent was Anglo-British nationalism, the nationalism seldom referenced in the media. The term ldquoUnionist, in the time of Brexit surely being an oxymoron, and certainly contrary to majority opinion within the Tory Party.Mr Salmond gained nothing for his positivity, being told a Scottish English border would be ldquocustom posts, barbed wire, and armed guards: contrast that with the proposed ldquoinvisible border in Ireland. Or Scotland being rebuffed on a currency union, oddly this is now cast as the ldquoSNP ditching the pound by todays British nationalists.And there is not much love coming from the Tory leadership contest. What we are told by the contestants is that Scotland will not be ldquoallowed to be independent: that while border polls in Northern Ireland are guaranteed by international treaty , that winning elections with a Scottish electorate, or gaining a majority in Scotlandrsquos parliament is not ldquoa mandate for a plebiscite.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I NOTE with wry amusement the ambitions of Jo Swinson, prospective Liberal Democrat UK Leader .Ms Swinson will have no truck with the SNP or an independence referendum she hopes for a Liberal Democrat government after Brexit. Again we read about the LibDems breaking the mould of British politics, something they have forecast every time they make a small advance. The mould of British politics was well and truly broken by the Brexit Party in this yearrsquos European election  seats, with the LibDems on . I might also point out that the Tories got four and Labour .Two things she hinted at: she is not completely against co-operation with the Tories, despite their previous alliance with that party destroying any credibility the LibDems had. And her ambition to be Prime Minister would be dunted by the fact that there is a thing called English Votes for English Laws which could debar her from any Cabinet office on that score I am constantly surprised at the survival of David Mundell.

Having worked for the BBC in the past, I continue to appear on it occasionally and should include myself in those ranks.Tough love needs to be dispensed because those at the top of the corporation are clearly not getting the message. It is time, dear Auntie, to get your act together or get your coat.The corporationrsquos defence can be split into three parts. First, it is not to blame for . million pensioners losing their free licences. Correct. A Labour government introduced the measure, a Conservative Chancellor, George Osborne, then dumped the bill in the BBCrsquos lap after barely any public consultation.Next defence: the BBC has to pay talent what it is worth otherwise the stars will go where. Nonsense. Certainly, the BBC has had some of its better known names quit for the private sector, among them Chris Evans, Eddie Mair, and Simon Mayo. But there are only so many Evans-size salaries out there, and only one Chris Evans. The idea that private enterprises are ready to splurge vast reserves of cash on an exodus of BBC talent is laughable. What would their shareholders say for a start : BBC says it is doing wellAs for the old Lrsquooreal defence ndash the stars are worth it ndash really  Gary Lineker is worth more than a Prime Minister, a First Minister, a surgeon, a teacher, almost any profession you care to mention  Steve Wright, for pressing buttons and singing over the music, merits a pound, pay packet As for Huw Edwards, almost half a million pounds for anchoring the news, a skill that can be summed up as ldquoreading aloud  It is not just on-screen iniduals either. More than  managers earn over pound,.Meanwhile, the poor bloody infantry, the ones who put in the night shts and the weekends, the ones who make the talent shine, are stuck on low pay and rolling contracts that offer little in the way of job security. Never mind, they can at least comfort themselves with the knowledge that the gender pay gap between well paid men at the corporation and well paid women is closing, with three women now in the top ten earners. As for everyone , good luck with the claims, now inching along like tipsy slugs.The last of the BBCrsquos defences is that it costs a lot of money to provide what it does, but it still provides great value. The answer to that is simple: stop doing so much. No one asked for BBC Sounds. No one asked the BBC to build a vast online news empire, paid for by the state, that took jobs, readers, and advertisers from newspapers.: Anger as Beechgrove is prunedThe new BBC Scotland channel is a case in point of the corporation trying and failing to deliver what it thinks viewers want.Take, for example, The Nine, the channelrsquos flagship news show. Just the blend of local, national and international news required, all of it from a Scottish perspective. You see reports on here you never would on the Six or the Ten, which fulfils the remit exactly. It is the kind and quality of show thatit had been on at six orsquoclock would be hauling in the viewers. But it is on at nine orsquoclock, right up against the mainstream channelsrsquo big hitter dramas and documentaries, so its viewing figures are ridiculously low.The Nine languishes where it is because the BBC in London was terried of a Scottish Six, fearing it would be a sop to nationalism. To disguise that lack of courage a whole new channel was constructed at greater cost. While some of the new channelrsquos offerings have been well worth watching, Yes No: Inside the Indyref chief among them, they could have easily found a home on the existing BBC  Scotland. As for the rest, the stale soup of repeats and shows that should never have been made in the first place ndash who needed another quiz show  ndash are dragging the channel down. When it comes time to make cuts, as it inevitably will, which programme will go: the relatively expensive The Nine or the cheap as chips fare The corporation might tell itself it is catering for a new, younger viewer who watches television in a dferent way, but there it goes again, looking in the wrong place for answers. Instead of trying to please a generation that wonrsquot pay for anythingit can get away with it, the BBC should be satisfying its existing customers more.The BBC will never have pockets deep enough to match Netflix or Amazon. What it does have is the ability to do certain things very well, such as drama. More Bodyguard and Killing Eve and less dross would be just the thing for the discerning viewer. People do not want an endless choice. Just scrolling through the Netflix menu is becoming exhausting.By cutting back the big wages, and building on the success of Studios, the corporationrsquos profitable production and distribution ision, the BBC can start to get serious about reducing its dependence on a licence fee that is not going to be around forever.In Years and Years there was a happy ending, normal civilised society was restored and the BBC came back.

He concluded with a plea to the council to visit the site and ldquoremove the said eliphant.He wrote: ldquoAdam Kerr baxter, burgess of Edinburgh humbly complaine upon Abraham Seyboura Dutchman owner of the eliphant that where I having ane shop and oven at the head of the fishmercat close with a back vault to the south thereofhellipwho keeps his eliphant therin and exposes the same his Dung and water thereof comes so doun upon my said vault that it has spoylt the samehellip and comes doun in great quantities upon the vault and spoyle and abuses the concerned goodsrsquo.According to city archivist Vikki Kerr, further research revealed the owner of the elephant had also raised a petition with the Town Council, asking for permission to parade his animal for the pleasure of the cityrsquos residents.ldquoItrsquos the first time wersquove found that kind of petition in the Town Council minute and shows that people at that time were getting the chance to see something quite dferent and exciting as an elephant walking down the High Street, she said.The elephant is said to have been kept within a building near Fleshmarket Close, named after a nearby meat market. A stonersquos throw from the Royal Mile, the Old Town area around the close is now popular for short-term holiday lets and Airbnb properties.Ms Kerr added: ldquoItrsquos hard to imagine an elephant going up a narrow set of stairs, so we can only think that the bakersrsquo shop and oven were on a lower level and the elephant might have entered at street level.ldquoMost of the letter is quite legal and pompous, and we havenrsquot been able to find out what happened next, although I suspect the Dean of Guild would have wanted to visit to see it for themselves.Indeed, the female Indian elephant had already endured an unhappy le before reaching Edinburgh, having apparently been shuffled around ious European cities after first being shown at a trade fair in Leipzig in  when she was already around  years old.Over the course of the next  years, she was displayed across Europe, travelling between Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Switzerland and France accompanied at times by an ldquoAfrican Jungle-Donkey ndash thought to be a mandrill or an aardk ndash and a bizarre three-legged animal.She eventually arrived in London in  and was touring England when her owner, Bartel Verhagen died. His will stipulated that his prized elephant should be passed into the care of assistant Jan Janszoon, however, she ended up being rented out to Mr Sever.From the time of her original ownerrsquos death to her own demise, the elephant is said to have earned  guilders, compared to an ordinary Dutch labourerrsquos earnings of around  guilders a year.Despite the financial benefits of keeping her alive, Mr Severrsquos lack of experience in elephant handling ndash and a decision to trek her north to Aberdeen in late winter ndash left her starving, exhausted and frail.But while her death in a ditch just outside Dundee may have been sad, it also led to the first dissection of an elephant in Britain, carried out by surgeon, botanist and anatomist, Dr Patrick Blair.Historian and author Andy Drummond, who researched the lsquoDundee elephantrsquo in his book Elephantina, said the discovery of the letter is another fascinating insight into the elephantrsquos unfortunate le.ldquoShe gave a demonstration to the Duchess of Hamilton in  and then trampled off to Aberdeen in March and towards Dundee, he said. ldquoThe elephant keeled over in Broughty Ferry because of the weather and lack of food.ldquoItrsquos a little sad, but at the same time people benefitted greatly, such as Dr Blair.His pioneering scientic study of the animals internal organs and skeleton brought him fame and recognition at the highest level.ldquoHe couldnrsquot believe his luck, added Mr Drummond. ldquoHe basically took it apart bit by bit, while someone documented all the things he pulled out of the elephant in drawings.ldquoHe then had a very long scientic paper published in the journal of The Royal Society in London.\"According to Dr Blair, the elephant stood just over  feet high and  feet from nose to tail.

Enough is enough.Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.NICOLA Sturgeons response to the UK Government review of devolutionmakes more sense and is more accurate when applied to herself. Turn her tweet around to \"a desperate rant by a First Minister who has shown zero respect for the UK Parliament during her time in office. Its for the Scottish people ndash not a nationalist MSP ndash to consider and decide what future we want for our Parliament and country.\"Not once has Ms Sturgeon tried to work with the UK Government since SNP got into power. On every issue, everything has been grievance and confrontation.The SNPs ambiguous economic plans are based on even more ambiguous levers.We should admit our mistake.

The more honest candidate , Jeremy Hunt, now concedes that leaving the EU without a deal will be as damaging as the financial crash of . He admits that \"thousands\" of people may lose their jobs in such an event, but he would do it \"with a heavy heart\". This puts the interests of the Conservative Party ahead of those of the nation as a whole. The charade of Brexit began with an attempt to outflank the Faragists and threatens to become an economic disaster. Even now Conservatives of all hues are concerned that failure to deliver a Brexit before the next election will be a disaster ndash for the Conservative Party.Meanwhile a bidding war is taking place to spend Philip Hammondrsquos war chest to cushion Brexit on all sorts of pork barrel promises, mainly to benefit the ageing and wealthy membership of the Conservative Party. Having woken up to the dangers of their Brexit folly for the integrity of the United Kingdom, both seek to cloak themselves in a Union Flag ndash though the bulk of the Conservative electorate place Brexit before the Union.This must come as an extreme embarrassment to Unionists in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Union means far more to them than their English counterparts, despite the rhetoric. Perhaps the time for a reappraisal of the constitutional arrangements of these islands is at hand.Even more embarrassing must be the rhetoric past and present of the front-runner, Boris Johnson. Past references to \"verminous\" Scots have been brushed under that carpet, as have taunts that a pound spent in Scotland was less effective than a pound spent in south-east England ndash which must be why so much is spent on the south-east. Mr Johnson now says that as the next Prime Minister he would style himself also as \"Minister for the Union\" though most of that seems to involve bashing the SNP rather than addressing the deep inequalities in the UK. But, peculiarly, that could all change tomorrow. After all, he is the man who put \"liar\" into peculiar. But this may be our next Prime Minister.Larry Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.I AM intrigued by Keith Howells descriptionof \"Scotlands positive place in the Union\" given Scotlands lack of positive benefits from more than  years of oil production, while repeatedly being saddled with Conservative governments we never voted for, and now facing the probable prospect of a Tory Prime Minister who will be a positive nightmare for Scotland. And Scotlands decision to remain within the European Union has been positively ignored since the EU referendum in  by politicians who have the cheek to talk about delivering democracy.If David Cameron had accepted Nicola Sturgeons proposal that the UK would only leave the EUall four nations voted to do so, Scotland would be in a far more positive position than our current prospect of being hauled over the edge of the hard Brexit clf we positively never voted for.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE actions by the Brexit Party leader and his stooges in facing the wall during the EU anthem is surely the final insult that these obsequious iniduals can render to us here in Scotland.They do not represent Scotland and Scots who voted to remain in the EU. No doubt, our EU friends will be glad to see them gone after Brexit, but the final irony would surely beArticle  were revoked and these nasties would have to continue.However, the EUrsquos representatives, in particular Joseacute Manuel Barroso, former President of the European Commission and an Anglophile, must be squirming now having been led by the nose by David Cameron to attack us during the independence referendum and support Better Together. How they and he must feel now to see that Better Together has brought about a scenario where Scotlandrsquos definitive vote to remain in the EU has been thwarted. So now you can start to stand up for Europositive Scotland.The EU must ensure now that Scotland is fast-tracked into membership when the UK of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ceases to exist. In fact, as other nations from the formerYugoslavia and Czechs and Slovaks who separated from Czechoslovakia, were admitted, there is no reason now to consider the UK sacrosanct as the English and Welsh vote took the UK out.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amOrkney’s -athlete-strong contingent which will compete at the NatWest International Island Games is set to arrive in Gibraltar today.

This has been under constant review, some might say attack, since .#Commenting after the Coastguard Agency consultation meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, Thursday, on the future of emergency tug provision in the north of Scotland, Mr Carmichael said: “For the third time in nine years the Maritime Coastguard Agency is again consulting on future provision of emergency tugs and for the third time in nine years it looks like a botched job.“The consultants engaged by the MCA have been set tight and arbitrary deadlines. Today’s meeting in Edinburgh seems to be the last chance for input from outside government. I fully support the call made by Councillor Steven Coutts for an extension of the time for responses.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course.

This greatly improves the confidence and interactions between customer service teams and passengers helping to build lasting relationships.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travellers.Earlier this year NorthLink implemented its new ‘Recite Me’ accessibility tool to the website to enable more people to experience the NorthLink Ferries website in a way suitable to their needs.NorthLink staff have also attended disability awareness training with Access Panel Orkney and in , NorthLink teamed up with a sign language interpreting agency to improve access and user experience for its customers with hearing dficulties.For more information Neatebox visit www.neateboxcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I don’t want mundane days I want everything in summer to be as full and vibrant as ripe fruit, evenit’s just the extravagant laziness of doing nothing at all to the fullest possible extent.The quintessential summer, in my own mind’s eye, takes the form of one specic picture: sitting on my grandparent’s front steps, eating an ice pole, while the neighbour downstairs gardened and I picked paint off the railing to look at layers of colour underneath. A warm day with the flowers blooming, blue skies and distant lawnmowers, the sweetness in the air of my nana’s roses, suspended in time forever. When my mind wanders, thinking of summer, that moment is always there. I cycle through other scenes: the intention,not necessarily weather-permitting reality, of beer gardens. My papa packing a flask of tea before a day out in the car. Touching the chilly North Sea as a wave comes in. Lying on my back reading, while there’s a breeze blowing in and nothing to do: in a caravan, with the door open and gas stove hiss of tea being made, or rain pattering on the roof. Sometimes I think about being suspended on a plane, with nothing to do but waste away time with a book before stepping out into unfamiliar humidity.: The indignity of modern train travel – Laura Waddell: Fleabag: Priest’s sexual advance has got people talking – Laura WaddellNostalgia is the ultimate Instagram filter, but hope is close behind. When we daydream of the summer we want, we’re not thinking of nothing at all, but of a clearly defined atmosphere, one we want to plunge entirely into, dferent from our everyday lives rather than merely undoing them. Temporarily, we enter alternate reality, whether through memories or hope for how our summer might look. The city itself looks dferent in the sunshine. We rediscover gardens and parks. New ways of being are possible. I walk around looser in my skin, later into the day. We don’t want to drop out of reality entirely – other than a break from everyday chores, tedium, or anxiety – so much as we want to e headfirst into glorious feeling. Sights and sounds, cut crass, chilled wine, and sunshine langour. Summer is intense, in the way that the orange of Aperol spritzes is intense, the smell of lavender is intense, and heat on our brow is intense. Deeper sleeps, longer lies.It’s rarely so idyllic, all of the time. But the best stories, of course, also temporarily take us out of reality and set us down where. And so they are, I feel, the ideal summer reads – like for like. There are some practical considerations. Physically, you’ll probably want a paperback that can be chucked in beach bags or shoved down into a backpack alongside bug spray, water bottles, sandwiches and sunscreen. Books are made for using even an object fetishist like me, who spends a lot of time looking at book cover design, still batters their corners.If I’m travelling I might seek out something set in the destination ahead to double up on discovery. This year, ahead of a pinching-myself lucky work invitation to Vienna to celebrate Bloomsday – books have enabled me to travel to new places, literally as well as figuratively – I dipped back into Austrian author Stefan Zweig’s shorter stories, full of emotion, which often depict longing in settings such as hotel rooms and train stations, reflective of his status as a Jewish intellectual dispersed during the Second World War. His experiences have never felt irrelevant, and his storytelling skills are classic. As I work in the book industry, for summer reading I often choose books I don’t have to review, write about, or recommend in any way. No publication dates looming. A dissolution of everyday demands. It’s a rare, weightless chance to browse shelves without looking for anything in particular, although inevitably, I’ll weigh myself down from trips to bookshops wherever I go.Recently I did an author reading in Shakespeare and Co, the revered, ramshackle, cat-installed English language bookshop in Paris, celebrating the launch of an anthology called We’ll Never Have Paris which invited a sprawling number of writers to depict it as they see fit a theme that emerges is reconciling the Paris of romanticised imagination with the everyday reality. While I was there, I pluckedLauren Groff’s Fates and Furies from a high and tightly packed shelf, a bestseller from a couple of years ago that I’d been meaning to read for ages. It’s a dense and lyrical book exploring one marriage’s successes, sacrices, and hidden rages. While keeping cool from the record-breaking heatwave sweeping Europe, I also read Heartburn by Nora Ephron, a short, sharp satire of eighties New York and Washington society full of wit, humour, and recipes, and Tokyo Ueno Station by Yu Miriwhich shows the city from a rare perspective, that of a homeless labourer asking himself whether years of gruelling work building Olympic stadiums had been worthwhile, capturing the everyday atmosphere of transient camps.In the summer, with more time to wander and get lost, I gravitate towards books that will immerse me in their world some of the very best hazy-dayed reading memories I have include plunging into Donna Tartt’s addictive New England intrigues, Elena Ferrante’s two fists full Napoleon epic that took me through all seasons, and Samanta Schweblin’s eerie Argentinian bio-horror Fever Dream.Each to their own, of course. Wholeheartedly, I believe anyone should read whatever they want, should they choose. But for me, summertime reading will always be something I can travel through, as much as with, taking me to places I don’t yet know or deepening my imagining of those I do, but crucially, upending reality just like a strike of sunlight washing over my face is able to.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first meeting of citizens assembly to take place in edinburgh","story":"The first meeting of the Scottish Government#s planned Citizens# Assembly will take place in Edinburgh later this year, with members paid # for each session they attend, it has been revealed.The Assembly, made up of  members of the public, will be asked to look at a way forward for Scotland as SNP ministers set out plans for a second referendum on independencethe UK leaves the EU.But the Conservatives have already branded the exercise a “Nationalist stunt”, while one pro-Union campaign group has called for its members to boycott it.The impartiality of the planned body was further questioned when Joanna Cherry, a senior SNP MP, claimed the Assembly was “the perfect way” to advance independence.But constitutional affairs spokesman Mike Russell has insisted that the Assembly would be independent from SNP ministers as a key principle of its establishment.: Pro-Union parties brand Citizens’ Assembly a ‘Nationalist stunt’The Scottish Government today published a revised tender document for a potential contractor who will be responsible for recruiting the  members required for the Assembly, along with  substitute members.The document states that the Assembly “will bring together members of the adult population of Scotland to discuss and deliberate on Scotland’s future”.The body will meet for six weekends between late October this year, one month later than originally planned, and late April , with Assembly members required to attend every meeting.According to the tender, members will receive “a gt of thanks” of £ per weekend for their time and contribution.

There is a deficit there that would be good to reverse. “For Scotland in particular, the infrastructure changes taking place in Pakistan present opportunities in terms of project management and consultancy, whether it be construction or finance. “In terms of energy, particularly renewables, their expertise is already being exported to places like China and I’m hoping Pakistan can be added to that.“In terms of education, I think our universities are well placed to create institutional partnerships with higher education providers in Pakistan. It’s about seeing it as a two-way link.“There is a growing middle class in Pakistan who want access to quality education and I think Scotland can help with that.”More than , Scots claimed Pakistani heritage at the  census, with by far the biggest concentration living in Greater Glasgow.The links between the two countries are something Mr Nithavrianakis sees as a real advantage to his posting. This week he has met with ious community and business groups before he takes up residence in Karachi.“I see myself as a facilitator,” he added. “I can try and do the introductions between Scottish and Pakistan society.”He continued: “If there are Scottish businesses already working in the Gulf, it’s not dficult to get into Pakistan.“They may have been put off in the past by bureaucracy or corruption, but I think slowly that’s changing.”Mr Nithavrianakis added that Pakistan had endured some “terrible atrocities” since the turn of the century but that security was improving in parts of the country. He pointed to the resumption of British Airways direct flights to Pakistan, and the planned visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the autumn, as examples.Away from diplomatic le, Mr Nithavrianakis recently completed the Edinburgh Marathon in memory of his late brother, a fisherman from Castle Stewart, raising £, for the Fishermen’s Mission.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership hopefuls promise to defend the union as polls show a 50 50 divide","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland is now on an #inexorable journey# towards independence as a result of Theresa May#s time in office, as the Prime Minister makes a final visit north of the Border today before standing down.Mrs May will urge her successor to make safeguarding the union their “greatest duty” and also defend her own record on strengthening the UK during her three years in Downing Street.Leadership candidates Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will address a hustings event in Perth tomorrow night, days before postal ballots are sent to Tory party members who will elect Mrs May’s successor.The Tory leader will set out plans for a review of the UK government’s approach to devolution as she addresses an audience in Scotland this afternoon, but it has been dismissed as “too little, too late” by the SNP leader.The First Minister also warned that Mrs May’s successor will never “undo the damage” she has done to the Union.The SNP government at Holyrood is seeking to stage a second referendum on leaving the UK next year, in response to Brexit uncertainty.

Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

Our patrols also act as a means of deterrent to offenders and to reassure residents that patrols are being undertaken. Patrols are carried out on foot, bicycle, in marked and unmarked council vehicles and in private vehicles.“In order to try and tackle part of the problem, council has also adopted a robust enforcement policy in relation to stray dogs.”The spokesperson continued: “We also know that there unfortunately remains a small number of irresponsible dog owners who fail to clean up after their dog whilst out walking or by owners letting their dogs out of the house or pen to run around the neighbourhood late at night or early in the morning to foul. Dog owners know it is not acceptable to leave dog foul lying in the park or on the pavement. The message is clear, ‘Your Dog, Your Mess, Your Responsibility’.”Council initiatives aimed at tackling the issue of dog fouling include educating people about the importance of responsible dog ownership, the Green Dog Walker scheme encouraging people to clean up after their pets and the ‘Fed Up With Fouling’ campaign, which encourages people to report fouling offences.“Other ideas to tackle irresponsible dog owners are currently being developed as part of the Clean Neighbourhood project. These include the design of new publicity materials and introduction of dog control areas,” the spokesperson added.Anyone who witnesses a dog fouling offence is asked to report it to the council’s Enforcement Officers on    or by email - ehealth@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.ukThe council can issue fixed penalty fines by postit has the date, time and location of the incident, the name and address of the ownerand a description of the dog.Dromara and Community Art Group Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"day two of the balmoral show in partnership with ulster bank at balmoral park outside lisburn","story":"The weather stayed kind for visitors and exhibitors at the annual show window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringThursday  May  :Picture DeskPictures from PressEye and Pacemaker PressPACEMAKER BELFAST  :Day two of the Balmoral Show at Balmoral Park outside Lisburn.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ardoyne dancers top of the world","story":"AN Ardoyne-based Irish dancing school are celebrating after their success at the An Chomhdhail World Championships in Killarney.Lawrenson-Toal Academy of Irish Dance brought home a world champion to North Belfast with Caragh Hendron scooping first place in the under- category.

The property on the Ballysillan Road was so badly damaged that Mr Emerson says it was essentially handed over to him by a friend. Originally from England, he moved to Northern Ireland as his father was Irish and became a community worker in north Belfast in the s. \"I had worked as a community worker in the North Belfast Development centre,\" he explained.\"In  I resigned and only after did they tell me that when you resign you do not get unemployment benefit. \"Financially I was a bit stuck, so I started gardening when I moved into this house in . \"It was derelict but is now a listed building and is looking much nicer than it once was.  Because I was financially not very well off I started growing food.

What we are trying to avoid here is a no-deal Brexit which I think would be a very considerable burden for businesses in Northern Ireland and across the two islands.“That’s what we are trying to avoid and that is what the report does in trying to set up a dferent way of solving the problem and issue of the Irish border.”Panel chairman Shanker Singham highlighted that one of the proposals was the establishment of a Government fund to help financially support businesses who had to increase their administrative capabilities.He said the arrangements could also be implemented with the use of existing technology.“Media often says it’s all about technology – it’s not all about technology,” said Mr Singham.“Technology is not the driver for the solution, but it’s equally absurd to say technology plays no role at all.“Technology has a component – it supports the technical and administrative processes we are talking about.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp shannon to be investigated again over parliamentary expenses","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That completely misses the basic point that in any democracy you are very likely to see or hear things with which you may disagree.  “A shared future – by any reasonable definition - means that Orange Parades should be facilitated not prevented. The Orange Order is part of the rich history of Belfast, and the lack of tolerance shown towards the Order is a problem that must be addressed.” Its the fourth year the parade has been restricted.The Parades Commission said it restricted the parade after considering its potential for public disorder and its impact on community relations and community le.In its determination it noted the \"tensions\" surrounding the parade, in particular at the peace line at Workman Avenue. It stated the parade organisers had not engaged with the local community in a bid to broker a local agreement.

The Parades Commission Code of Conduct statesa parade is to \"pass through an area where the majority population is from a dferent tradition, or through an interface area, it would be important for the organiser to take steps to establish a line of communication\".\"Efforts should be made to meet reasonable concerns of residents.\"The Parades Commission added: \"Such an accommodation would build confidence within both communities but requires dialogue between parade organisers and residents groups.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And for construction firms,  will be the second year in a row in which an industry body has recommended stoppages for just two days - Friday, July  and Monday, July .However, Mr Webb said that people were still in the habit of booking their holidays over the first two weeks of July, regardless of company policy on stoppages. And with many offices giving their staff both the public holidays of July  and July  off, he said it was a wise move as staff only need to take eight days of annual leave to get a full two weeks off.A spokesman for Harland and Wolff confirmed it will close on Friday, July , with no weekend shts, but reopens on July . However, aerospace company Bombardier said it will close from tomorrow and reopen on July .

Meanwhile, dairy co-operative Dale Farm said its production facilities were open all year round.Newry company MJM Marine said it closed on July  and  but that due to work commitments, some of its staff would still be coming in.Mr Webb said that even though companies were staying open during July, a quietness had descended on Belfast. \"The economy does slow down during this period, even a lunchtime walk through Belfast city centre reveals a noticeably quieter place,\" he said.  \"While tourists appear plentul, office workers appear in shorter supply. \"So, while the Twelfth brings a slowdown in activity here, the traditional shutdown is a thing of the past and tourists coming in are offsetting some of the local exodus.\"Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said: \"July remains a signicant holiday period for Northern Ireland with many locals going on holiday both within NI and abroad.\"However with the growth of tourism we are also beginning to see an increase in out of state visitors during the same period. \"With the majority of our hospitality businesses opening as usual, trading does see geographical shts to our key local holiday destinations and around major events.\"The Construction Employers Federationindustry body announced in  that it was ending the -year tradition of observing the Twelfth fortnight as an annual holiday.And Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said the concept of the Twelfth fortnight had died out in the manufacturing sector around three decades ago. \"Theres been a big sht over recent years where very few places actually close down completely over the Twelfth,\" he said.\"But it was never really unorm all across NI.

The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EU’s top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker.

The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia.

One will not understand this feelinghe is not hungry or thirsty themselves.“The Muslim community in the city has merged these two principles together to raise donation for the people who need food to feed their families.“There is no better time to run this campaign than the month of Ramadan and there is no better local charity to support this good cause than Foyle Foodbank.“We are collaborating with Foyle Foodbank third year in a row for Ramadan fasting challenge. We managed to raise £, first year, £, second year and £, this year with our Ramadan charity fasting challenge donation project.”Foyle Foodbank manager James McMenamin thanked the NW Islamic Association for their continued support.“There has been a steady increase in the amount of money they have donated each year. This enables us to buy food that we’re running low on and will also help with teaching courses in debt management.”InclusionEach year in the month of Ramadan the North West Islamic Association invites members of the local community to take part in a fasting challenge where participants fast for a few hours up to full day depending upon their capability and preference.Families, friends and colleagues sponsor the participants by donating money.“At North West Islamic community centre we also run this donation appeal and set up donation box as well. Most of the people from Muslim community who attend for prayer and other events put money in this box to support this campaign as well in addition to show support for the participants,” Mr Bahli said.“The most impressive thing is that kids at the Islamic community centre break their kitty boxes to participate in this campaign.“All the participants are invited to join the Muslim community at the time of breaking the fast in Islamic community centre on the day of the challenge. There are a selection of dishes prepared for this day by the Muslim families from dferent countries“This project strengthens the bonds between communities and helps to know each other and to understand ious cultures and traditions in a multicultural environment. There is great sense of friendship, building bridges and sense of inclusion amongst the communities.”He concluded: “These types of projects are vital in a society to promote combined efforts for a good cause and aims which are beyond race, religion and nationality.“North West Islamic association is grateful to the participants of the challenge this year and also to the people who have donated money for this great cause this year and years before and for support in future.

He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

While these works are important and will undoubtedly benefit the town in the long term, there really does need to be more strategic thinking here.”But the department responsible for the Roads Service has defended its actions..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p “As far as possible the department aims to keep roadworks disruption on the strategic network to a minimum,” a spokesperson said.The department said other necessary works on the main roads connecting Limavady to Londonderry and Coleraine had either been finished in advance of major works in Ballykelly, or delayed until afterwards.“Due to the nature of the works at Ballykelly and Baranailt Road near Claudy it was not possible to delay further,” the spokesperson added.“Other work on Irish Green street and Rathbrady Road has been purposely timed to be carried out during the summer period to avoid disruption to local schools.”Security alert ends after ATO remove WW training round Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
