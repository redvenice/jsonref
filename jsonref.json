All of the three trendy singers have blurred circles on their ears.No policy has been issued by China\u0027s television watchdog to prevent the appearance of earrings on men, but an insider who works at one TV station told China News that programmes had been informed to obscure \u0027particularly large ear accessories in close-up shots\u0027.  Fans are confused and angry  after their idols appeared on TV with their earlobes covered. The reported rule comes after  stars were told not to have tattoos, dye their hair or being \u0027sissy\u0027Like many topics or objects targeted by Chinese censors, the \u0027earring ban\u0027 seems to be an internal directive passed on by word-of-mouth. News site Sina reported that  internet programmes would also be subject to the new policy. The article explained that most of the entertainment programmes were shot a long time in advance, therefore the production teams had to cover their stars\u0027 earlobes after receiving the order. Chinese fans are confused, angry and heart-broken after hearing the rumour. They protest against the alleged policy on Weibo and demand an explanation from China\u0027s State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.  The Chinese television watchdog has issued multiple rules in the past two years in hope of preventing alternative cultures from spreading on TV - a move aiming at keeping the country\u0027s youngsters in check. In the summer of 2017, male stars were told not to have ponytails while a female singer was given a large graphic hat in the shape of a ladybird on her head during a show for dyeing her hair pink.Early last year, China launched a crackdown on hip-hop and artists with tattoos. A popular rapper was pulled from a reality TV show. It was thought that the Chinese government wanted to tighten their control over the often-provocative music genre."},{"url":null,"title":"Zoe Ball 1 6m BBC Radio 2 paid predecessor Chris Evans says father","story":"    Zoe Ball, 48, outside Wogan House in London after her first morning hosting the BBC 2 Breakfast Show on Monday  Chris Evans (left) was paid a £1.6m salary when he was hosting Radio 2\u0027s Breakfast Show, Johnny Ball (right) says that his daughter deserves parity\u0027She\u0027s had 15 years of greedy vase-owners... and now she\u0027s...\u0027Show two is like the second tricky album\u0027: Zoe Ball thanks...Share this articleHe told the paper his daughter was superb value for money, saying that if some people thought her salary was too great they should complain to the BBC.The BBC has faced a raft of criticism for its male dominated salaries.The heavy-hitters for 2017-18 were Gary Lineker (£1.75m), Chris Evans (£1.6m) and Graham Norton (£600,000).The highest paid woman for that year was Claudia Winkleman (£370,000) who placed 13th in the male dominated list.Miss Ball became Radio 2\u0027s first female weekday breakfast show host on Monday.

But following the decisive rejection of the government\u0027s deal by MPs on Tuesday, those cannot be on the basis of your existing red lines. \u0027It is clear that no tweaks or further assurances are going to win support for the government\u0027s Brexit deal in Parliament.\u0027We have set out an alternative framework for a better deal: based upon a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union a strong Single Market deal and guarantees that there can be no race to the bottom on rights and standards. \u0027That is the consistent position that Labour has outlined over the past year.

Strangely for an event calling for peace in the Middle East, it did not involve Israel.Corbyn also attended a meeting in the Houses of Parliament, in 2015, just six months before he became Labour leader, organised by pro-Palestinian pressure group Middle East Monitor.He sat with Daud Abdullah, a Hamas-linked figure who signed a letter calling for the Royal Navy to be attacked if it attempted to stop weapons being smuggled into Gaza. Abdullah also said he was prepared to blow himself up in a suicide attack, telling the BBC: ‘Sacrificing myself for Palestine is a noble cause.’Corbyn’s explanation: Initially, he denied being involved with the wreath-laying in Tunisia, but when challenged, he came up with the much-ridiculed reason: ‘I was present when it was laid. I don’t think I was actually involved in it.’ Photos then emerged showing him holding a wreath. As for the meeting with Hamas in the Houses of Parliament, he later said he regretted calling them his ‘friends’.          Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking at St Mary\u0027s in the Castle during a visit to Hastings in East Sussex todayPROTEST AT DRONE ATTACKS ON ISISThe Labour leader took part in a protest at an RAF base in Lincolnshire in 2013, calling for the Armed Forces to be banned from the ‘obscenity’ of using drones as part of the West’s war against the terror group that has killed hundreds of thousands in the Middle East. This included the use of drones against ISIS’s British executioner, Jihadi John. Indeed, the former Westminster University student seems to have been someone Corbyn wanted to be able to walk Britain’s streets, judging by an interview he gave in 2015 with Arab TV station LuaLua.Corbyn’s explanation: He said moves to ban jihadis from returning to Britain were ‘strange’ and ‘legally very questionable’. At a Stop the War rally (before becoming Labour leader), he said that the ISIS beheading of Alan Henning, a British aid worker, was ‘the price of jingoism’.PAID £20,000 TO HELP IRA SUSPECTAs a newly elected MP in 1983, Corbyn invited IRA apologist Gerry Adams to the Houses of Parliament. The two men met on other occasions during the Eighties, when the IRA was at the height of its terror campaign. Corbyn even put up £20,000 of his own money to stand bail for an IRA terror suspect facing extradition to Germany.He also invited two convicted IRA volunteers to tea at Westminster in 1984, just two weeks after the Brighton bomb, which killed five people staying at the Grand Hotel for the Conservative Party conference.          Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein political party of Northern Ireland at the House of Commons in 1996In 1986, Corbyn was arrested outside the Old Bailey during the trial of Patrick Magee — later convicted for the Brighton bombing — in a protest against the strip-search of his co-defendants. After the Brighton attack, London Labour Briefing (a far-Left monthly journal Corbyn helped run), published a reader’s letter stating: ‘What do you call four dead Tories? A start!’The Labour leader also attended the annual gathering of the Wolfe Tone Society, which honours dead and imprisoned IRA members.In 1986, the event programme said: ‘Force of arms is the only method capable of bringing about a free and united socialist Ireland.’ In 1987 Corbyn was at a commemoration for eight IRA men shot by the SAS as they attempted to attack a police station in Armagh.In 1996, the year of the Docklands and Manchester bombings, Corbyn again invited several suspected IRA terrorists to Parliament and tried to host a book-signing by Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams — although this was stopped after Tony Blair threatened to eject Corbyn from the Labour Party. All these meetings were long before the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, when the IRA called an end to its armed struggle.Talks?

I obviously did meet people from Sinn Fein, as indeed I met people from other organisations, and I always made the point that there had to be a dialogue and a peace process.’He was later forced to retract his claim he’d never met the IRA after Labour MP and former lover Diane Abbott said he’d shared a platform with IRA members Raymond McCartney and Brendan McKenna, the latter having been jailed for bombing a British Legion hall.At no point did it appear that Corbyn asked Sinn Fein to renounce violence as a condition for meeting its leaders. Even when the IRA said it was downing arms, Corbyn struggled to condemn its murderous activities during The Troubles without equating them with the British Army’s role in defending Northern Ireland from paramilitary groups. He infuriated British soldiers by saying: ‘I condemn all bombing. I condemn what was done by the British Army as well as by the other sides.’          The Labour leader also attended the annual gathering of the Wolfe Tone Society, which honours dead and imprisoned IRA members. Pictured above in Hastings today AN INVITATION TO HEZBOLLAHOfficials from the Lebanese group — which is classified by the U.S. government as a terror organisation and which has called for the destruction of Israel — were invited by Corbyn to a meeting in 2009. He said: ‘It will be my pleasure and honour to host an event in Parliament where our friends from Hezbollah will be speaking . . . I’ve also invited our friends from Hamas to come and speak.’Corbyn’s explanation: Asked during a hearing into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, in 2016, why he’d called the terror groups ‘friends’, he said: ‘It was inclusive language which, with hindsight, I would rather not have used. I regret using those words.’ However, he hasn’t used the phrase ‘inclusive language’ this week when defending his refusal to join Mrs May for Brexit talks.HIS OTHER LINKS TO EXTREMISTS...Corbyn travelled to Syria to meet its brutal president Bashar al-Assad in 2009. Millions have been killed and made homeless during the country’s civil war, and Assad has been accused of launching more than 100 chemical attacks against his own people.Corbyn’s trip was hosted by London-based lobby group the Palestinian Return Centre, which was later embroiled in controversy for holding a meeting at the House of Lords, where a speaker claimed a ‘heretic’ rabbi had ‘antagonised’ Hitler to ‘systematically kill Jews’.Corbyn recorded his trip in the Members’ Register of Interests, saying it was worth £1,300.          Corbyn travelled to Syria to meet its brutal president Bashar al-Assad in 2009. The trip was hosted by the controversial London-based lobby group the Palestinian Return CentreInstead of explicitly condemning Assad, he says he abhors violence on all sides. Corbyn has equated the power of Assad’s police state with the country’s rebels.He also joined a group to welcome Abdallah Djaballah — a controversial Algerian politician and leader of the radical Islamic party the Movement For National Reform who has called on his countrymen to ‘wage holy Muslim war’ against Britain and the U.S.This was at a 2014 event at Finsbury Park Mosque, North London, where Islamist rabble-rouser Abu Hamza once preached.Corbyn was also photographed at the mosque making the Rabbi’ah, the four-fingered salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, the theocratic group which was involved in the ‘Arab Spring’ uprising in Egypt in 2011, but which is regarded as a terror organisation in some Middle East countries.Corbyn’s spokesman said that in making the salute, the Labour leader was ‘standing up for democracy, justice and the right to protest in Egypt . . . the four-fingered gesture is a well-known symbol of solidarity with the victims of the 2013 Rabaa massacre in Cairo.In 1984, Corbyn lobbied a variety of ‘Latin American cultural organisations’ on behalf of what he called ‘comrades’ in the Colombian revolutionary socialist group M-19.These ‘comrades’, according to the Sunday Times, have car-bombed, shot, tortured and killed their way across the country in recent years.Corbyn also criticised the Colombian government’s crackdown on M-19, accusing it of ‘repressing’ them. At the time, M-19 was little more than a glorified drugs gang behind a series of cocaine laboratories. It was also known for funding its activities with kidnappings and ransom demands.Corbyn also helped the men accused of being the 1988 Lockerbie bombers, who killed 270.In 1992 he signed a letter supporting their bid to avoid trial in either the UK or the U.S. ‘One has to ask whether they would receive a fair trial in a British or U.S. court,’ he said.And after Al-Qaeda’s 911 outrage, Corbyn wrote in the Socialist Campaign Group News, a paper for Left-wing MPs, that the West was responsible with its ‘blanket support for Israel’s occupation of Palestine’.He was only willing to concede the 911 attacks were a tragedy in the context of what he regards as other, equal tragedies — including Osama bin Laden’s death, the Iraq War, the ‘attack on Afghanistan’, as well as the treatment by Western soldiers of Iraqi and other prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the Bagram military prison."},{"url":null,"title":"Historical dictionary containing 4 000 words Yorkshire dialect released","story":"    Dr George Redmonds spent more than 60 years collecting words for his dictionary of Yorkshire dialect.

It’s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands’I took the picture in the summer of 2013, in a rural part of northern Austria. I grew up in Holland. I went back there in 2012 to try to recapture my own childhood, but the farm where I was born no longer existed and the people I knew as a child no longer lived there. And then I found my childhood – or what I wished it had been – here, in the Austrian countryside.I was asked to do a documentary project about the Waldviertel region, which is how I came to meet these two local little girls, Hannah and Alena. Their mother, Sonja, asked if I would take some pictures of them.That summer, I travelled to their grandmother’s farm in a village called Waldberg, between Vienna and the Czech Republic. It’s where they always spend their holidays. We became friends and I’ve been going back ever since to photograph them.The two boys – Martin, who is on the swing with the girls, and his brother Christian, whose hands and feet peek out from behind them – are their friends who spend their summers at the farm, too. When I first met Christian, all he wanted to talk about was my camera. But, from the outset, the girls simply did their own thing. I would start our sessions with a few posted portraits, but soon they would get bored and ignore me. And that’s when I would begin to work.I think I was lying on the ground to get this shot, with my 35mm. It’s a camera I love because it allows me to be right inside the image, and I want my viewers to feel the same thing.I don’t know if I purposefully avoided showing their full faces. It wasn’t to anonymise them. Rather, it was to capture something more universal. Instead of looking into their eyes, you follow their inidual gazes, and you see the social dynamics at play between them. But I’m not really interested in what they’re playing with. Here, I hate those metal pipes, they spoil my picture. And without the children, there is no picture.Alena, the older girl, is at the centre of the image, and that’s true in how they play together. It’s a role that naturally falls to her – she is in charge, she decides what they’re going to do, and where they’re going to play. The others are happy to follow her lead. And while any other adult – a parent or a grandparent – might be tempted to intervene (“Don’t do that” or “That’s too rough”), I don’t judge, I don’t comment, or direct anything. I might be present, but the kids are on their own. Wherever they go, I go. They don’t see me. They’re in their own world.It’s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands of Christian’s. The longer I live, the more I long to be a child again. This project has perhaps been more about looking not for my actual childhood, but one I might have had.When I was two, my father and older sister Anita were in a car accident. Anita was killed, and my father was left with the mental age of a child of seven. So the only father I knew, growing up, was someone who was aggressive, and of whom I was ashamed. He wasn’t a normal father. Perhaps this is why I look for the idyllic, or the romantic in the stories I shoot – to balance things out, as a coping mechanism. I think that the most important things that happen to you, in life, happen between the ages of two and 12.When I see these four children here, in their own world, what I love is that they’re in charge. They are powerful. And that’s how I choose not only to depict children in my work, but also how I want to relate to them in everyday life: as human beings, as equals. Respected, empowered, not patronised. They inspire me.• Carla Kogelman’s I Am Waldviertel is at Schilt Gallery, Amsterdam, until 9 March.

While locals may worry about the growing number of empty stores in their town centre, the other side of the coin is the devastating impact on retail property values.When it opened in 1981 the Postings, which cost £4.25m to build, promised to be a magnet for shoppers. Each store opening prompted local news, with 1980s TV celebrity and Generation Game presenter Isla St Clair even dropping in to cut the ribbon at the William Low store (a supermarket chain bought by Tesco in 1994) when it opened.But the now dated precinct, in what is Gordon Brown’s former constituency, has fallen on hard times. It was dealt a big blow in 2015 when Tesco – despite personal protestations from Brown – closed the superstore which anchored the mall and also doubled as the town’s post office.But the cost of the annual upkeep of the Postings is now thought to be higher than the £152,000 it brings in from rent, making its ultimate parent Columbia Threadneedle Investments eager to offload it after more than 15 years of ownership.Columbia Threadneedle said the Postings had been acquired for its rental income stream but that it had now been repositioned as a development opportunity that “does not fit the holding fund’s investment strategy”.Quite who would see it as a development opportunity is another matter.Famed as the birthplace of the 18th-century economist Adam Smith, Kirkcaldy once had coal, textiles, linoleum and electronics. Today the biggest employers in the town of 49,000 people are the NHS and the council (which incidentally is the Postings’ most lucrative tenant, renting the car park for £70,000 a year). It has estates that are the most deprived in Scotland outside of Glasgow and in a recent interview with the , Brown revealed the number of families turning to its food banks had soared.“What the price tag tells you is the relevance or rather the irrelevance of these dated shopping centres in challenged towns,” said Matthew Hopkinson, co-founder of retail advisory firm Didobi. “This is a very difficult time to be a property investor because the retail sector is going though major structural changes.”Last year was a difficult year for the retail sector with a long list of high street failures, including House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld, while other chains including Mothercare and Carpetright, together closed hundreds of underperforming stores.There is some hope for the Postings, with Columbia Threadneedle reporting that the eye-catching price tag had created a lot of interest. “The reserve price of £1 is generating significant attention and we expect to get a considerable amount at the auction,” the company added in a statement.

However, their share of the mix has been gradually shrinking as renewables have grown and energy demand has fallen.More significantly, seven of the eight nuclear sites will have shut by the end of the 2020s as they reach the end of their lifetime, with only Sizewell B in Suffolk continuing to operate. The government has also committed to shutting the country’s last seven coal plants by 2025 at the latest.So far the only nuclear project to be given the go-ahead is EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C, a 3.2GW plant in Somerset, which will power about 6m homes when complete.The power station is officially due to begin supplying electricity to the grid in 2025 but similar projects in Finland and France have run many years over schedule. EDF has already warned the plant may not be generating until 2027.Originally there were concrete plans for five nuclear plants in the running to meet the UK’s new nuclear ambitions. But three of those – Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury – have been shelved. That leaves the 3.2GW Sizewell C in Suffolk, led by EDF and backed by the Chinese state firm China General Nuclear Power (CGN), and the 2.3GW, Chinese-led Bradwell B in Essex, which EDF has a one-third stake in.The government negotiated a guaranteed price for power for 35 years with EDF for Hinkley. Hitachi was trying to do the same, with the additional support of the government taking a multibillion-pound stake, but could not make the numbers work.Attention will turn to a new method of financing known as the regulated asset base (RAB) model, which the government plans to give more details on this summer. The RAB approach would mean a regulator setting fixed costs and fixed returns for a nuclear developer, to overcome the huge upfront cost of nuclear plants and years-long delay for investors reaping a return.If new nuclear plants do not materialise it will pose a challenge to tough carbon targets for 2030. It is unlikely to threaten energy supplies, given the speed with which gas plants and windfarms could be built.The main technology that has the scale to fill the nuclear gap is offshore wind power. More inshore windfarms and solar power would also help. The intermittent nature of those technologies could be addressed to a degree by more batteries and other storage, imports and technologies such as demand side reduction.

This slowdown highlights a shift in consumers making many of their Christmas purchases before December.Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, argues that a cocktail of factors - including Brexit - are to blame for the slowdown in spending:Everything from lower consumer confidence, Brexit fears, higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, slowing consumer credit take-up and business rates made 2018 a really tough year for retailers and 2019 could easily repeat such pain.December’s UK retail sales are even worse than expected, says David Madden of CMC Markets, especially if you strip fuel out.Economist Rupert Seggins explains that the retail sector hasn’t provided any economic growth this quarter -- not a good omen.Grace Blakeley, the New Statesman’s economics commentator, argues that people are too indebted and ground down by austerity to keep the high street in good health:Here are the key points from the retail sales data, just released (and online here)Newsflash: UK retail sales fell in December as shoppers reined in their spending.That’s partly due to the Black Friday sales (23th November), which dragged some Christmas spending forwards.This will fuel concerns that the UK economy - so long driven by consumer spending - is faltering.The ONS’s head of retail sales, Rhian Murphy, says:“Following the increased growth in November, where shoppers snapped up more Black Friday offers as they continue to bring forward their Christmas shopping, retail sales weakened in December.”“Retail sales fell back slightly in the last three months of 2018 with only petrol stations seeing significant growth.More to follow....Mnuchin’s apparent offer of help to China comes just a few days after Beijing announced it would cut taxes to help businesses, many of whom are struggling in the trade war.Airline stocks aren’t joining today’s rally, after Ryanair hit shareholders with another profits warning.A trade war breakthrough may be coming, but it won’t be coming at Davos next week.President Donald Trump has cancelled plans to send US officials, including treasury secretary Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer, to the World Economic Forum.This means the US won’t be able to discuss trade with China’s representatives.Trump has also blocked House speaker Nancy Pelosi from using a military plane to visit troops in Afghanistan, as the feud between the White House and Democrats over the government shutdown intensifies (something else for markets to worry about...)European stocks have opened higher, hitting their highest level since early December....Optimism over the US-China trade talks have pushed commodity prices to their highest levels in months.Investors are anticipating higher demand for steel and iron ore, if a breakthrough is found.Reuters has the details:“The signs out of the recent trade talks in China are promising and have boosted market optimism, despite the lack of concrete outcomes,” ANZ Research said in a note. Stocks jumped across the Asia-Pacific region overnight, following the WSJ’s report.Investors are hopeful that Steve Mnuchin could calm the trade war, says Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada:Optimism of trade policy again dominates overnight price action, with a report in the Wall Street Journal that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin (a free trade proponent, in contrast to Lighthizer and Trump) has proposed easing tariffs on China to support markets.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Investors are grabbing onto any straws of optimism in the US-China trade wars, as the clock ticks down.Overnight, the Wall Street Journal has handed the markets fresh crumbs of comfort, reporting that US treasury secretary has discussed lifting some of the tariffs imposed on China.Steven Mnuchin’s logic is that offering Beijing a carrot might help deliver a breakthrough in the ongoing trade war, ahead of fresh negotiations at the end of January.As the Journal puts it:U.S. officials are debating ratcheting back tariffs on Chinese imports as a way to calm markets and give Beijing an incentive to make deeper concessions in a trade battle that has rattled global economies.A swath of Chinese products now incur hefty tariffs at the US border, from food and chemicals to machinery. These levies seem to be contributing to a sharp deceleration in China.However, the Journal also reckons that Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is resisting Mnuchin’s idea. And overnight, the White House has poured cold water in the notion, saying:“No new tariff decisions have been made. We are focused on the current 90 day period and the expected high level visit by China Vice Premier Liu He at the end of this month.”But still, hopes of a breakthrough lifted Wall Street last night, with the Dow closing 162 points higher at 24,370 - extending its 2019 rally.It will push European stocks higher this morning too:UK retail sales figures will show whether consumer spending held up over the crucial Christmas trading period.We also get new US consumer morale data, which may indicate if the government shutdown is hurting the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8df5173251773317795112f0d013a7abfc46136a/0_0_2064_1238/master/2064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b09a5375476eb8d7a2f6a11c919b344","title":"neither north nor south nottingham by carol adlam an urban cartoon","story":"Author-illustrator Carol Adlam looks at liminal spaces caught between this Midlands city’s industrial past and its drive towards the futureSituated at the very centre of England, Nottingham is neither a traditional “northern” or “southern” city. With a a significant working class and industrial legacy that has left its traces on the cityscape in the lace-market, the extensive network of caves that run under the city, the canal, and derelict industrial-era mill buildings, it is also. Socially it is ided: on the one hand it is a thriving city with two universities on the other, there remains significant social deprivation in areas such as Nottingham north, with very low literacy levels.Radford Mill is on the canal edge, a vast textile-manufacturing mill building that is undergoing regeneration after years of neglect.From here the dramatic cliff edge of the sandstone outcrop on which the city centre sits can be seen. Sneinton Hermitage refers to a set of caves that were once inhabited by a religious order, and the 15-foot steel dragon that is partially hidden in the trees nearby is the work of local artist Robert Stubley.Nottingham sits on a vast sandstone escarpment in which there are extensive networks of manmade caves, some of which were in use for work and even habitation until the second world war. The tunnel is evidence of the historical ide between rich and poor in Nottingham: it was designed by 19th century architect TC Hine as a route for horse-drawn carriages to travel from the prestigious Park area to the west of the city centre, through to Derby Road. It is now used as pedestrian access from the Park to through to Derby road, an area recently regenerated by EU funding.The building opened in 1925 as the Palais de Dance, and sits at the junction of Glasshouse Street and Lower Parliament Street, a key thoroughfare into the city from the East side.This is the point at which the train lines and the tram network meet, bringing together the mid-nineteenth-century Midlands railway structures with modern-day infrastructureThis building housed the Nottingham  (1918-1953), known for its radical and non-conformist leanings. The building is one of hundreds designed by Watson Fothergill in Nottingham, whose neo-Gothic style characterises much of central Nottingham. The building is now offices, but its portico often offers unofficial shelter for Nottingham’s homeless people.The eighteenth-century building is the crossing point for central Nottingham’s pedestrians, who criss-cross the old market place as they go about their business.One of a small number of alleys that are woven through Nottingham’s centre, creating a set of hidden spaces next to the central shopping zones.

The Brexiteers sought to “take back control”, by restoring the sovereignty of parliament just as it was in 1972, the year before we joined the European Community, as the EU then was. But the world of 2019 is very different from that of 1972, when there was no Human Rights Act, no devolution, no Good Friday agreement, a world in which the referendum was thought to be unconstitutional. The past is indeed another country.Brexit was instigated by a referendum in 2016. But we have no rules determining when referendums are to be held, what issues should be put to referendum, how frequently they should be held, what majority should be needed for change and whether the outcome should be binding or merely advisory. The danger is that they come to be held, not for principled reasons, but to suit the convenience of the government of the day. We have adopted a new method of validating legislation, transferring sovereignty to the people, but without thinking through the implications.Brexit is being implemented by a government which has lost a vote by the largest majority since parliamentary records began. Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011, the vote would have been a matter of confidence. That would either have brought rebels into line, as happened with the legislation ratifying the Maastricht treaty in 1992-3 or, if defeated, the government would have been required to resign. But the Fixed-term Parliaments Act enables a government to continue in office without being in power. A government may be unable to secure its legislation, and yet the opposition may be unable to remove it in a specific vote of no confidence. The resulting deadlock hardly makes for effective government.The Brexit process has also, for the first in time in our constitutional history, politicised the Speaker. John Bercow might well have been right last week to allow the Grieve amendment to be debated – and this amendment did, after all, secure a majority. Where Bercow was wrong was in allowing it to be thought that he holds anti-Brexit views. The Speaker, like the Queen, must be politically neutral. Otherwise, future Speakers could be selected, not on merit, but because they can be relied upon to support the views of the government of the day. That would be a retrograde development.But above all, the Brexit process has highlighted the uncertainties surrounding devolution. It has led to a tacit amendment of the devolution legislation. For the government has decided that some parts of the devolved powers being returned from Brussels (in areas such as agriculture, fisheries and environmental protection), are to be retained by Westminster so as to preserve the internal market of the United Kingdom – a market which, until Brexit, had been regulated by the EU. Otherwise, there could be a harmful ergence of standards if, for example, there were four entirely different systems of agricultural protection in the four parts of the United Kingdom.But the government could not obtain the consent of the Scottish parliament for its stance. The National Assembly of Wales has, for its part, made the case for a constitutional charter, establishing a quasi-federal system in which the government would need the consent of at least one of the devolved bodies to alter devolution. But that, of course, is hardly compatible with the principle of the sovereignty of parliament.The implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland are even more serious. While the Good Friday agreement does not explicitly require a soft border, that was because it was assumed that Britain would remain in the EU. But the agreement’s provisions for North-South cooperation clearly require a degree of congruence between trading rules in the two parts of the island of Ireland. That indeed is the basis of the backstop, a backstop confined to very limited areas, primarily those necessary for North-South cooperation under the Good Friday agreement. From this point of view, the DUP’s hostility to the backstop is self-defeating since a hard border could lead nationalists in Northern Ireland to call for Irish unity so as to achieve a closer relationship with nationalists in the Republic. The backstop, paradoxically, is a guarantee for Northern Ireland not a threat.In its report on Brexit, the EU select committee of the House of Lords declared that the EU was “in effect, part of the glue holding the United Kingdom together since 1997”. That glue is now coming unstuck. Membership of the EU put us in effect under a codified constitution via treaties constraining both government and parliament. With Brexit, Britain will once more have an unprotected constitution in which our rights as citizens and the relationships between the different parts of the United Kingdom come, once again, to be at the mercy of a sovereign parliament, which, except when there is a minority government, is under the control of the executive.Might not the very nakedness of our post-Brexit condition provide an impetus for Britain to follow almost every other democracy by enacting a constitution? Might not Brexit prove to be our constitutional moment?• Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at King’s College London.

But it took on a new surreal meaning on Monday, when Theresa May asked us to consider what the history books would say about the vote on her deal.It takes truly great commitment to your own mediocrity to sort through a catalogue of your own mistakes, find the largest and most avoidable, and then tell the gods of history that yep, this national humiliation is the way you want future generations to remember you. It’s like calling up the Oxford English Dictionary and requesting that “to cock something up irrevocably, to the point that people feel a pang of despair when they hear your name” be for ever known as “doing a Theresa”.If, like me, you’re curious as to what history books will make of this period, then good news! I’ve managed to simulate a completely accurate version of the future using the latest futurologist technology and got my hands on a Key Stage 2 history book from 2070, looking back on 2019 in a course that they call “The Age of Screaming, Stupidity and the Crying With Laughter Emoji”. Here’s how our era is remembered in 50 years’ time …Back in 2019, Britain was much larger – it included Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and Norwich (now the modern-day Underwater Kingdom of Delia Smith) was still above sea level. Britain’s people were simple and angry, all of the time, and they believed in many mysterious superstitions: they thought that cancer could be cured if enough people grew moustaches in November, that cuddling a stuffed meerkat would bring them luck in their car insurance, and that you could effect a miraculous epiphany in Donald Trump by messaging him on Twitter.This silliness was borne out by the pop culture of the era: the most popular song was about building a city on thousands of sausage rolls, the most popular social media star was an egg, and the most popular pastime was blindfolding yourself and driving into traffic. If you want to imagine what it was like to live in this era, find the most expensive razor in the house and throw it into the toilet while shouting, “Take that, Gillette, you feminazis!”Many silly things happened during this era, but the silliest without a doubt was Brexit.No one knows for sure. Technically it means “Britain leaving the European Union”, but depending on context, it’s clear that it was also used as a verb (as in, “Oh, for God’s sake Nigel, you’ve Brexited the toilet again”), and as an adjective (“This Wetherspoons is well Brexit, there’s blood on the seats”). The nuances have been lost in the sands of time – some sources say that at the time Brexit meant leaving the customs union, some say it meant fewer “brown people”, some say it just meant having more Mrs Brown’s Boys on the telly. In 2019, it must have had a clear definition as a government would never carry out something that affected the lives of 70 million people based on a vague word whose meaning no one could agree on.Starting in 2010, the British government carried out a policy called “austerity”. Austerity was a process by which the money that traditionally went to things like schools, hospitals and hungry people, instead went to a man called Fred Goodwin. Nobody is entirely sure why, but at the time experts agreed that this was an extremely sensible course of action, just as in the middle ages experts thought that leeches would get rid of dysentery.The hungry people whose money went to Goodwin became angry, and they began to look for people to blame. They were encouraged to support Brexit by Nigel Farage, who became famous in the 2010s for drinking pints of beer and saying nonsense that made everyone feel better. Newspapers, who knew that what Farage was saying was nonsense, let him say it anyway because it made people angry, and in the 2010s that was the point of many newspapers. TV also let Farage say nonsense, because of a mystical ritual known as “journalistic balance”. This was an ancient tradition in the BBC which stated that for every true thing said on TV, someone would have to tell a massive lie, for balance.In 2016, the prime minister, David Cameron, decided to let the country vote on the nonsense, as that was easier than actually trying to convince them that it was nonsense. When he lost, he took up jogging and tried to write a book in a shed. Unfortunately, the shed never spontaneously combusted.Theresa May was the prime minister from 2016 to 2019. During this period, she had the opportunity to rectify the many mistakes of her predecessor, and to tackle the fundamental issues in British society that had led to the Brexit vote. If she had achieved this, she would have been remembered as one of the greatest prime ministers of all time. Unfortunately, May is most famous today for: alienating the EU setting arbitrary red lines in Brexit negotiations triggering article 50 without a plan calling a pointless election that lost the Tories their majority negotiating a Brexit deal just a few months before the deadline that didn’t have the support of her cabinet, let alone her party, let alone parliament trying to force that deal through parliament through deceit, blackmail and petty bribery and finally for losing the vote on that deal by a historically massive margin.May was placed in an impossible position by history, but her actions somehow managed to exacerbate the situation to the point that it pushed the country to financial and societal ruin.

Isn’t that going a bit far?As if it’s not enough for famous people to have better skin, better bodies and better houses than the rest of us, it seems these days they are also liable to demonstrate how much better they are at getting in and out of relationships. “Conscious uncoupling” is a celebrity-endorsed attitude towards separation, made famous by Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin. The aim is to be as generous and reasonable as possible about the end of the affair, in both public and private.The current queen of gracious orcees is Anna Faris, who poured out her happiness about ex-husband Chris Pratt’s engagement to Katherine Schwarzenegger on Instagram this week, saying, “I’m so happy for you both!!” before offering to perform the wedding ceremony herself (ostensibly a genuine proposition, given that she is an ordained minister).This perhaps takes things one step beyond even the hypercivilised efforts of Paltrow and Martin, who recently revealed that things had gone so well post-breakup that he had accompanied Paltrow on her honeymoon with new love, Brad Falchuck. Are there no heights of internal and external perfection that people in the public eye won’t aim to scale?“Conscious uncoupling”, and its counterpart “conscious coupling”, are phrases that suggest the possibility of a certain level of control over the emotionally volatile matters of love, sex and attachment. At its worst, the implication is that, if you are a clever, decent person, you should be able to manage your relationships in such a way as neither to cause, nor suffer, extremes of pain, and to preserve the dignity of both parties at every point in the romantic or sexual encounter.A brief flick through literary history might suggest that this is a tall order, but Shakespeare, Stendhal and the Brontës didn’t know what it was like to contend with the constant, baleful gaze of social media. In the old days people could have tantrums, wreak revenge and die of heartbreak when their love stories didn’t go according to plan. Now it is de rigueur to retain a consistent appearance of sentimental hygiene given that everything you do or say needs to be fed into the like-machine. It’s become a competitive sport. What would people think of you if they knew you felt hurt, rejected, brimming with envy or rage? Perhaps it would seem at odds with your job as guarantor of the possibility of the charmed life.Still, is conscious uncoupling simply another unrealistic, persecutory ideal? (If Paltrow can do it, why can’t I?) Or might there be things you can do on the journey in and out of love that can truly make life easier for everyone? The term itself was coined by the American writer and psychotherapist Katherine Woodward Thomas, and the process she describes is one of radical generosity coupled with fearless introspection. In practice, this means refraining from doing most of the things people are liable to do in the aftermath of a serious emotional letdown.For instance, don’t blame the other person and badmouth them around town. Even if they really did do something terrible to you, don’t be deflected from thinking about your own role in the situation. The point isn’t to “win”, but to learn. Allow yourself truly to mourn and recover. Don’t pay heed to that hideous old adage, “happiness is the best revenge” if you want to feel better in real life, the best way is to be honest with yourself about what you’ve lost, and to be frank about any hopes you have for the future. In short, Woodward Thomas is describing an authentic grieving process, some of which is liable to be very painful, and might not look nice from the outside.The problem, it would seem, isn’t in the phrase itself, but in the cheesy public enactment of “good” behaviour. Of course it may be the case that Anna Faris is truly and unreservedly delighted at her ex-husband’s good fortune – although, to a cynic, the offer to get among the actual moment of knot-tying smacks a little of hyperbole – but one can’t help wondering about the unspoken sadomasochistic pacts between celebrities and audiences.We hold them to impossible standards, which they then attempt to demonstrate for us at goodness knows what cost to themselves, and we punish them when they let us down. We, in turn, risk finding ourselves feeling terrible when we are unable to adhere to the ideals of perfect social grace we see constantly enacted in front of us. In this alienating hall of mirrors, one must attempt to look good at all times.Losing love, and being replaced, can be terrible narcissistic blows.

The savage parliamentary mauling of Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the European Union allowed Rupert Murdoch’s pet tabloid to unveil on Wednesday morning a front page of grandly gleeful malevolence. Under the headline Brextinct, it conjured a creepy chimera of Theresa May’s head pasted on to the body of a dodo. But the thing about such surreal pictures is that it is not easy to control their interpretation. From the outside, this one seemed to suggest much more than the immediately intended message that both May and her deal are politically dead. When, it prompted one to ask, did Brextinction really happen? Was this strange creature ever really alive or was it not always a grotesquely photoshopped image of something else, a crisis of belonging that has attached itself to the wrong union? Do the events of this week point us, not towards the EU, but to the travails of a radically disunited kingdom?The dodo, after all, may be proverbially dead but it has a vivid afterlife in that great trawl of the English unconscious, Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. It is the Dodo, when various characters have fallen into a pool of tears, who suggests how they might dry themselves – the Caucus-race. “There was no ‘One, two, three, and away’, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, ‘The race is over!’ and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, ‘But who has won?’”This seems, this week more than ever, a perfect description of the state to which British politics has been reduced – a lot of frantically anarchic running overseen by a defunct creature, the Brextinct dodo. And who has won? Carroll’s Dodo, of course, decrees: “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.” Having emptied Alice’s pockets to provide rewards for everyone else, the Dodo solemnly presents her with the only thing that’s left: her own thimble. “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble.”The Brexit game is patently not worth the thimble to be presented at the end of it. Yet in Theresa May’s humiliation on Tuesday, there were prizes for almost everybody else: a glimpse of opportunity for her rivals in cabinet a revival of their sadomasochistic no-deal fantasies for the zealots the hope of a second referendum for remainers proof of the near-collapse of the Westminster order for nationalists the hope of a general election for Jeremy Corbyn. But in truth nobody has won anything – it is a losing game all round.For all of this is the afterlife of dead things. One of them is Brexit itself. When did Brextinction occur? On 24 June 2016. The project was driven by decades of camped-up mendacity about the tyranny of the EU, and sold in the referendum as a fantasy of national liberation. It simply could not survive contact with reality. It died the moment it became real. You cannot free yourself from imaginary oppression. Even if May were a political genius – and let us concede that she is not – Brexit was always going to come down to a choice between two evils: the heroic but catastrophic failure of crashing out or the unheroic but less damaging failure of swapping first-class for second-class EU membership. These are the real afterlives of a departed reverie.If the choice between shooting oneself in the head or in the foot is the answer to Britain’s long-term problems, surely the wrong question is being asked. It is becoming ever clearer that Brexit is not about its ostensible subject: Britain’s relationship with the EU. The very word Brexit contains a literally unspoken truth. It does not include or even allude to Europe. It is British exit that is the point, not what it is exiting from. The tautologous slogan Leave Means Leave is similarly (if unintentionally) honest: the meaning is in the leaving, not in what is being left or how.Paradoxically, this drama of departure has really served only to displace a crisis of belonging. Brexit plays out a conflict between Them and Us, but it is surely obvious after this week that the problem is not with Them on the continent. It’s with the British Us, the unravelling of an imagined community. The visible collapse of the Westminster polity this week may be a result of Brexit, but Brexit itself is the result of the invisible subsidence of the political order over recent decades.It may seem strange to call this slow collapse invisible since so much of it is obvious: the deep uncertainties about the union after the Good Friday agreement of 1998 and the establishment of the Scottish parliament the following year the consequent rise of English nationalism the profound regional inequalities within England itself the generational ergence of values and aspirations the undermining of the welfare state and its promise of shared citizenship the contempt for the poor and vulnerable expressed through austerity the rise of a sensationally self-indulgent and clownish ruling class. But the collective effects of these interrelated developments do seem to have been barely visible within the political mainstream until David Cameron accidentally took the lid off by calling a referendum and asking people to endorse the status quo.What we see with the lid off and the fog of fantasies at last beginning to dissipate is the truth that Brexit is much less about Britain’s relationship with the EU than it is about Britain’s relationship with itself. It is the projection outwards of an inner turmoil. An archaic political system had carried on even while its foundations in a collective sense of belonging were crumbling. Brexit in one way alone has done a real service: it has forced the old system to play out its death throes in public. The spectacle is ugly, but at least it shows that a fissiparous four-nation state cannot be governed without radical social and constitutional change.European leaders have continually expressed exasperation that the British have really been negotiating not with them, but with each other. But perhaps it is time to recognise that there is a useful truth in this: Brexit is really just the vehicle that has delivered a fraught state to a place where it can no longer pretend to be a settled and functioning democracy. Brexit’s work is done – everyone can now see that the Westminster dodo is dead.

It traces his rise from beer-brained dropout to an intern during the Nixon administration, then covers his tenure as secretary of defense during the Gulf war, and his time as George W Bush’s official deputy from 2001-2009.McKay, after establishing his career with comedies such as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Step Brothers, moved into freewheeling, lightly fictionalised accounts of real-life events. His previous film was the financial-crash comedy The Big Short.McKay’s kaleidoscopic approach – the narrative chopped up, and peppered with asides and data breaks – recalls the larky yet hard-hitting style of the British journalist and film-maker Adam Curtis, the person behind films such as The Power of Nightmares and Bitter Lake.The two men also share an interest in unpicking political narratives and in examining how the structure of society can be insidiously shifted by iniduals – and, of course, they share a first name. So, we asked them to sit down together for a cup of tea with Paul MacInnes at the Soho hotel in London.They began by discussing Vice’s key sequences, set in the late 1970s, when Cheney (Christian Bale) and Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) orchestrated a rightwing stealth-revolution that ushered in a sustained era of Republican power and idealism.AC: The very interesting question is why the opposition let it happen. They bought into inidualism. I think the left gave up on mass politics and power sometime in the early 70s, and went for a much more inidualistic way of being radical, through art and self-expression. It became a nice way of being. But what you chart in Vice is a ruthless power grab. The really interesting thing about our time is that no one talks about power. The left don’t talk about it the liberals don’t talk about it.AM: The entire reason I made the movie was because of what you just said. Nobody talks about power any more. Honest to God. There was the whole movement of taking power that we just ignored.AC: We didn’t see it.AM: And the Democrats just rolled over. They betrayed the unions, and really started to believe in this idea of free trade, markets, banks and a load of gibberish.AC: I think you’re spot on. It’s the fundamental problem of why the left and liberals can’t find a way of challenging what’s rising up now. They gave in, and have given up talking about power. I think that’s because power is quite frightening.AC: Suddenly, you realise that you can make the world the way you want it to be. I think what you show Cheney beginning to realise is: if I get this, I can do anything.AM: Information warfare is where we’re living now. More specifically, it’s story warfare. There’s this battle in the US where our oligarchs are claiming they are the Joseph Campbell heroes. That they’re the ones who are going through the three-act structure of going into the unknown. Charles Koch is taking on the world. There’s this weird thing going on where these traditional story structures really play bogus now.AC: That’s because they have been appropriated by those people who really do have power. But that’s also because politicians have given up telling stories. They have nothing to say any longer.AM: I met with some of these Democratic leaders, and they talk about polling and market testing like they’re bad network executives. I have to tell them: the second you do that, you’re dead. That’s why the Democratic party is not tackling global warming – because it polls terribly. And why wouldn’t it? It’s about the end of human life.AC: That’s because they present it as a doom-laden dystopia, and not an opportunity to do something to change the world in an extraordinary way.AC: Exactly. Because that allows you to combine it with attacking austerity and the badness of the present day, and saying we can produce a better world, for now and for the future. But global warming is not presented as an opportunity to change the planet in an extraordinary and better way, is it? It’s a dark force that we’re being sucked into, and can do nothing about. The politicians and the thinktankers, say: “Oh my God! It’s all going to die.” My theory is that they’re late baby boomers projecting their own fear of mortality on to the planet. They’re trapping us in the depressed mind of a dying hippy. That’s my theory.AM: So what’s in the movie you’re working on?AC: Its working title is What Is It That Is Coming? At the moment, I’m on the seventh episode I think there are going to be nine episodes.AM: I can’t wait.AC: I don’t know. Yesterday was not very good.AM: I’ve been in those spots as well. A few times on this movie, we had that. I needed a “What the hell are you making?” friend. We had some screenings early on where audiences we aghast, and I was like: “Hey, we’re just starting off … relax. It’s a process!”AC: Were they aghast because they couldn’t understand the narrative or because they thought you were going too far?AM: They were aghast because the narrative was tough, and a lot of it was upsetting. People get very nervous, you know.AC: I don’t show my stuff publicly like that. I show it to my executives. I just think it’s incredibly risky to show stuff early on when you’re trying to combine, say, two or three different narratives together to make a bigger point. It’s so easy to get it wrong. Because you can see it in your brain, but they don’t know your brain.AM: You’re naked. You’re really naked. It’s like you’re going out to dinner and, before your date has arrived, you’ve opened up the door of the bathroom, and you’re completely naked and still combing your hair. That’s really what you’re doing, and it’s almost always disastrous, but I find the pain very helpful. I can take the punch in the mouth. It just keeps us honest.AC: What I find is that, increasingly, audiences are happy if you make big jumps. They don’t mind that at all, whereas five years ago, say, they would have been more wary. You did it in this film. You made this big jump in time and in subject area.AC: I think it’s because they spend their time online nowadays, making jumps.AM: I couldn’t agree more. On this movie, at a point early on, we go with Cheney to his mother-in-law’s funeral, and then we jump to him later as Dick Cheney in the modern era ordering the extraordinary rendition of a cleric. It was a 25-year time leap and the audience was, exactly like you were saying, thrilled by it. They loved the adjustment they had to make.AC: Yes. And they also feel quite flattered that you’re saying to them: “OK, catch up.” Rather than: “I’m patronising you.” They work at it and they like it. Like being a collaborator with you.AM: I’ve been trying to work on a utopian movie.AC: That would be good.AM: The idea is that nine people from our time are frozen in some accident and come back 200 years from now. And they’ve solved everything. You come out, and all the architecture has plants growing through it. There’s moss on the walls because it insulates, and they’re using light to remove trauma from people. People are just wonderful. They are playing stringed instruments, meditating and exploring space – and your plumber can paint like Picasso. And our souls are just opening up. But I want the whole movie to be done from a paranoid point of view. That the nine people are like …AC: “… there must be something wrong …”AM: “… don’t you get what they’re doing to us?”AC: “There must be a conspiracy somewhere!” Have you noticed that everyone believes in conspiracy theories nowadays? I mean everyone. I wonder if it is not just a defence mechanism against actually doing something to change the world for the better.AM: I think so. It’s more fun to pretend, and people love to think that they have the answer that no one else does. I have a relative who, I just found out, believes that the Sandy Hook shooting in the US was made up. I’m like: “Oh my God. I don’t know if I can be in a room with him.” But then we started talking about why you would ever believe this. And I think the idea is: “I know, I know.”AC: It’s an empowerment thing, I think. It goes back to politicians not telling you stories any longer. If they don’t tell you stories any longer, you’re left in this dark world by yourself where all these frightening things come rushing in.AM: We’ve been in a war of storytelling and mythology, and we have been slaughtered.AC: I think there is a great capacity among those on the left to tell good stories, but that they’re frightened of doing it. The reason is because, they say, the last time you told powerful stories you got Hitler and you got Stalin. The left has always been frightened by what they call populism.AM: I love that point – that the left is afraid of the power of power. Of powerful stories, of mythologies.AC: But you can see why it is, because this is what happened the last time you released the power of the mob, the really big crowd. There was a really interesting thing in the 1950s, after the second world war the Americans did an exhibition called the Family of Man, which was a collection of photographic portraits of people from all over the world. It was a complete sensation. It was funded by the State Department, not as a great conspiracy, but because of this idea that what you have to show people now is that we’re just a world of iniduals. Because what Hitler and Stalin had done was show us as mass crowds – and that went badly out of control and led to horror.I think that went very deep into the liberal psyche, that the mob is frightening. It’s dangerous. And that’s why, when we get to this point – where someone like Cheney and the anti-democratic forces around him have taken power away. To challenge that, you’re going to have to bring people together with a very powerful story. But that’s frightening – potentially dangerous. So the left retreat into that mantra which you find everywhere online, that we are all self-contained iniduals who all have our own little story. And we’re all going to tell each other those personal stories on Instagram and Twitter, and it’s going to be a nice, stable balance. Well, it’s too late for that now. The have-nots are fed up with that system – and are turning to powerful nationalist stories coming from the far right. But unless the left comes up with its own dramatic narratives, which offer an equally powerful vision of a better future, the right are going to win. And in a much bigger way than they’ve won so far.As told to Paul MacInnes.

Best supportive actress is closer to the mark for an award frequently handed to women playing the stoic, loyal wives or partners of great andor troubled men – often in that most Oscar-favoured of genres, the biopic.Jennifer Connelly won gold as Alicia Nash, long-suffering wife of paranoid schizophrenic Nobel laureate John Nash, in Ron Howard’s dully sanitised A Beautiful Mind. In a similar register, Alicia Vikander recently took the prize for playing Gerda Wegener, wife of painter and pioneering sex-change patient Lili Elbe, in The Danish Girl her own art career, unsurprisingly, is a secondary concern in Tom Hooper’s film. The tenor of the role can vary. Rather than a noble pillar of encouragement, Marcia Gay Harden’s fiery Lee Krasner was a fiery peer and opponent to Ed Harris’s Jackson Pollock in Pollock in the very different fictional context of My Cousin Vinny, Marisa Tomei’s gum-chewing mechanic saves her dim lawyer boyfriend’s hide by comprehensively outsmarting him.Yet all these characters are developed only insofar as they aid the arc of a male protagonist, with nary a scene or story strand to call their own. That may seem part and parcel of a supporting actor’s function, though comparatively rare is the man who has been celebrated for playing second fiddle to his onscreen wife. Moreover, it’s a trend that occasionally spills over into the best actress race, as when Reese Witherspoon won for propping up Joaquin Phoenix’s Johnny Cash in Walk the Line, or Felicity Jones landed a nomination for the Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything nominally recognised as leading roles, they nonetheless work in service of a more prominent male subject.This year sees a couple of female actors pursuing the “supportive wife” route to Oscar glory. In the controversy-dogged Golden Globe winner Green Book, Linda Cardellini’s role as sweetly saintly Italian-American homemaker to Viggo Mortensen’s uncouth chauffeur may be too thin to pass muster even by conservative Academy standards frankly, the film is fighting enough pushback over racial matters without further attention being drawn to its iffy gender politics too. Claire Foy, playing another 1960s housewife to an emotionally unavailable protagonist, is in a better position for the Neil Armstrong biopic First Man: her Janet Armstrong brings some flinty defiance to the film’s domestic drama, as she rails against her husband’s self-oriented career and part-time parenting, but she loves him through thick and thin nonetheless.But it is longtime Oscar bridesmaid Amy Adams who makes a stealth lunge for win by playing a less wholesome variant on the supportive wife figure, or what one might call the Lady Macbeth model: the woman who stands by her morally dubious man by getting her own hands a little dirty. Adams hasn’t plucked this characterisation from thin air. In Adam McKay’s satirical Dick Cheney biopic Vice she plays Lynne, the glibly ambitious wife of George W Bush’s insidiously powerful VP, and she and McKay are hardly the first chroniclers to suggest the outspokenly conservative Second Lady exerted her own influence on her husband’s venal politics.Adams plays her as a ruthless, sunnily beaming gorgon behind a fixed beige helmet of soccer-mom hair all homely, Wyoming-bred family values on the outside, though it’s her family who witness her frequent transitions into cool-blooded strategist. Early on, she icily tells her alcoholic husband just what upstanding image she expects him to project, seemingly setting the tone for his entire transformation of self and career decades later, when her daughter Mary’s homosexuality proves a political obstacle, she advances a voter-friendly stance against gay marriage with similar practical sangfroid. Her husband, the film implies, was rather more torn.As such, in a film that fashions itself as an anatomy of a bad guy, Lynne Cheney rather steals her husband’s thunder, emerging as the supervillain of the piece. It’s a lavishly grotesque role, and Adams attacks it with her usual precision and conviction. If the result is less startling than Vice would like it to be, it’s because Adams – whose goody-two-shoes persona endures more in the popular imagination than via her script choices – has performed this very about-face before: her Lynne Cheney is a paler echo of her role in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master as Peggy Dodd, the austere, controlling wife of a Philip Seymour Hoffman’s inscrutable cult leader. A shift in milieu and tone notwithstanding, the performances are such sister studies in passive-aggressive power-playing that you practically expect a repeat of The Master’s famous angry handjob scene. (McKay mercifully spares us.)Such parts are routinely described as “juicy” – all the more so when they represent against-type opportunities for a performer like Adams. But they’re not especially rich or generous: Lynne Cheney may well be every bit as ghastly as the film makes out, but the film flattens her into a vicious feminine archetype, denying her any complex inner life so as to make her husband seem more conflicted by comparison. It’s a stock characterisation every bit as bland as an insipid leaning post like Connelly’s Alicia Nash, and it has ensnared actors as fine as Laura Linney in Mystic River and Bridget Fonda in A Simple Plan a streak of villainy might make it more fun, but hardly more deep.McKay plays into the Lady Macbeth trope so self-consciously as to write a whole scene between Lynne and Dick Cheney in iambic pentameter, but she’s too unexamined and briskly unquestioning to merit the allusion. McKay joins a long line of Hollywood screenwriters paying lip service to feminism by writing these “behind every powerful man” women, without showing much interest in what lies behind the women in question.Over on the small screen, Robin Wright exemplified the Lady Macbeth type with fierce aplomb on Netflix’s House of Cards: her Claire Underwood ultimately emerges from her husband’s shadow to become not just president and the story’s victorious power broker, but the solo lead of the show. Yet the fact that it took an unplanned calamity – Kevin Spacey’s professional downfall – for that to happen makes her the exception that proves the rule. In 2019, screenwriters shouldn’t wait for a man to fall on his sword before giving his wife her due."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8602959988f49ae911fcb415fcd840e02eaa14f6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4f7e1d832c86268a1c7bf1833bf160","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Who will Pochettino turn to up front? Will Lindelöf banish bad memories of Brighton? And should Sarri start Giroud? If Mauricio Pochettino could have picked one Premier League team to start playing against without his top scorer and his most in-form attacker, then he would surely have plumped for Fulham. Claudio Ranieri’s defensively chaotic side are the perfect opponents in a far-from-ideal scenario for Tottenham, who must learn to cope without Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. It will still be interesting to see how Mauricio Pochettino tries to overcome those losses. Perhaps he will ask Dele Alli or Lucas Moura to play as a shifty striker or maybe he’ll deploy Fernando Llorente, a more conventional centre-forward who netted a hat-trick in the recent annihilation of Tranmere Rovers? Or the manager might even push his faith in youth to an unprecedented extreme by giving a start to the highly promising 16-year-old Irish striker Troy Parrott, who has yet to appear for the senior team? Whatever the manager opts for, Spurs can be confident of victory given that Fulham have been so hapless this season that they even managed to concede two goals last week despite restricting Burnley to no shots on target. PDThe talk of Claude Puel being on the verge of the sack at Leicester is a nonsense, or at least it should be. The Frenchman was booed during last week’s defeat to Southampton but fans and certain journalists seem to have the blinkers on to the wider picture, hungry for the next headline. Leicester sit eighth, one place and one point off their highest realistic target of seventh. In the last month they have beaten Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton. Yes, the FA Cup defeat to Newport was poor but more lasting positives – from Puel’s immaculate conduct and poise in the aftermath of their chairman’s death to his role in the development of James Maddison and Ben Chilwell – should endear him to both the board and his fans. Moreover, who would even replace Puel? Brendan Rodgers and Chris Coleman seem to be the favourites to replace him. Whatever the result against Wolves this weekend, Leicester should stick with Claude. MBOne of the more interesting developments of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s brief but eventful tenure at Manchester United has been Victor Lindelöf’s drastic improvement. The centre-back has completed 90 minutes in all five Premier League matches under Solskjær and been excellent positionally sound, dominant in the air and with the sort of ferocious but well-timed tackles that made Nemanja Vidic such a cult figure. The visit of Brighton shouldn’t present as stern an examination as Kane and Son at Wembley last Sunday, the Seagulls have scored nine times on the road in the league this season, but holds a degree of symbolism for the Swede. The reverse fixture last August witnessed a performance the polar opposite of his current form as United lost 3-2, while a mistake against Spurs the following week, prompted Jamie Carragher to rule: “I actually feel a bit sorry for him, he should not be playing at this level.” Lindelöf is making that assessment look increasingly rash. JPWilfried Zaha has blown hot and cold in recent months but he is still one of the last opponents a side would wish to face when shorn of their best right-backs. The injury to Trent Alexander-Arnold, on top of the absence of Joe Gomez, means that for the visit to Anfield of Crystal Palace, Jürgen Klopp will probably have to resort to the plan that he was so eager to avoid at Brighton and use James Milner at right-back. As a bona fide utility superman, Milner can be expected to do as well in the role as he did in recent wins over Wolves and Bournemouth but that will not be good enough if Zaha is on song. On the plus side for Liverpool, having to play Milner (and Fabinho) in defence practically obliges Klopp to start Xherdan Shaqiri in midfield again. The Swiss was below par at Brighton but has previously demonstrated that he has the ingenuity required to link sharply with Liverpool’s front trio. Get that connection right and Liverpool should open up a seven-point lead on Saturday before Manchester City take on Huddersfield a day later. PDNewcastle’s 4-2 victory over Championship side Blackburn in their FA Cup third round replay on Tuesday was comprehensively their biggest of the campaign (albeit inside 120 minutes) and only time the fifth time they’ve beaten an opponent by two goals or more since the start of the 2017-18 season. On just three occasions have they found the target more than once this term while Saturday’s opponents are equally as awful in the final third, Cardiff having scored one goal in their last five games in all competitions. Unsurprisingly, the two teams rank 17th and 18th in the Premier League for chances created per game (Newcastle 7.6, Cardiff 7.4) and average shots on target (Newcastle 3.2, Cardiff 3.0), which adds up to a bleak afternoon on Tyneside. That being said, if one inidual – Salomón Rondón or Ayoze Pérez for the hosts and Callum Paterson or Víctor Camarasa for the Welsh side – can produce, it’s likely to be decisive and absolutely vital in the context of the relegation battle. JPIt will be interesting to see if Maurizio Sarri deploys Olivier Giroud against the Frenchman’s former club, Arsenal, this weekend. The World Cup winner will be itching for his first start of 2019 not only is there a point to prove to Gunners fans but with possibly the last chance to remind those in blue of his undeniable quality before Gonzalo Higuaín’s probable arrival at Stamford Bridge. Barcelona have been linked with a move for the 32-year-old this week and if Sarri opts for a more mobile central striker at Arsenal – Hazard played there last week against Newcastle – one could forgive Giroud for dreaming of Catalonia. MBNathaniel Clyne was last included in an England squad in May 2017 but his subsequent time in the wilderness at Liverpool, through injury and the emergence of Alexander-Arnold and Gomez, has left him firmly out of the international picture. That undoubtedly influenced the right-back decision to move to Bournemouth on loan where he has played 90 minutes in both of the Cherries’ games since his switch south. He’s set to make his first home Premier League start for his new club against West Ham in what will be a significant test, matched up against Felipe Anderson. The Brazilian presents a unique threat whether he opts to dribble 1v1, drift inside and potentially drag his marker out of position with Aaron Cresswell overlapping, make a run behind the defence or attempt to play one of his clever inside passes. A strong performance at the Vitality Stadium can help Clyne show he deserves to still be part of the England conversation. JPWho’s the best manager outside of the top six? Eddie Howe? Nuno Espírito Santo? Manuel Pellegrini? Rafael Benítez? He’s rarely in the discussion but, on this season’s evidence, it has to be Javi Gracia. The understated Spaniard, who on Monday celebrates a year in charge of Watford, has guided his team to seventh as the “best of the rest” and, bar a run of three defeats in late Novemberearly December, two against Liverpool and Manchester City, the expected winter slump hasn’t materialised. This is following a minimal transfer spend in the summer (approximately £26m) plus the sale of their most potent attacking player in Richarlison, highlighting the weight of Gracia’s coaching ability and the methodical squad planning behind the scenes at Vicarage Road. An encounter against a resurgent Burnley, led by Watford old boy Sean Dyche, presents its own complications but Gracia’s malleable and adaptive style has, so far, shown Watford capable of playing their way around teams or winning ugly. JPThe atmosphere at the John Smith’s Stadium has been among the best in the Premier League, even during a campaign in which results and luck have gone against Huddersfield with dispiriting regularity. But the mood could be different on Sunday as there will inevitably be at least a hint of sadness at the absence from the sideline of David Wagner, who remains much loved despite the club’s position at the foot of the Premier League and his departure from the role of manager this week. Mark Hudson, temporarily promoted from his U-23 coaching job, has the mighty task of trying to pick up a team that has not won in 10 matches and getting them to stop a Manchester City side in ominous title-chasing mode. Might there still be wonders at Huddersfield after Wagner?

This is what he said about it:It was totally straightforward. Leicester offered me a deal and I was always going to sign it. I’ve had some good times here and hopefully I can continue to do so. When I first signed, I looked at the squad that was in the dressing room and the Club itself in terms of its fanbase and what sort of club it was. It was a family Club back then and it’s a family Club now. It’s something that suits me down to the ground. It really fit in well with me as a person and it’s the perfect fit for me.Here’s Marco Silva, who implies that he will keep playing Richarlison at centre-forward despite a five-game goal drought:My aim as a coach and a manager is to put the starting XI on the pitch and the XI I think is the best solution for each match. Richarlison can play out wide or as a striker now he is playing more as a striker. I know every three or four matches he doesn’t score the same conversation will come again. I know he hasn’t scored since Boxing Day but he is a possibility to play as a striker, and I will decide the best solution as to who will play in that position. What I can say is he feels as comfortable in that position as he does playing out wide, it is the same for him, and it is up to us to decide.Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has delivered an update on Manchester United’s preparations for tomorrow’s home game against Brighton.

We were on our way home, heading towards Red Road bridge in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, when I heard a commotion ahead.As we approached the bridge, dusk was starting to fall and I could see a figure hunched over on the ground, uncomfortably close to the wall. It was a young man, clearly in distress, crying and shouting, his whole body shaking. I froze, suddenly aware of the gravity of the situation. The bridge ran over a high-speed train track and was a well-known suicide spot. A local family had lost their teenager in that exact place a few weeks earlier.David and I exchanged glances. There was no one around. I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if his death was reported the next day and I’d done nothing.I inched towards the slumped figure, Joey instinctively glued to my side. I asked the young man if I could sit down, then lowered myself on to the ground opposite him, while Joey sandwiched himself between us.I tried a few gentle questions: “What’s your name? How old are you? What do you do?” His answers were monosyllabic. “Tommy. 23. Computers.”“Are you OK?” I asked. “No, I’m not!” he shouted back. He muttered something about a betrayal, and not knowing what to do. His emotions were swinging wildly – tears one moment brittle anger the next. I was desperate to make a connection, asking him where he went to college and feigning delight as I told him my son had studied there, too. I even found myself recounting the story of Neil Laybourn, who had talked a man down from Waterloo bridge in London 10 years ago.“They’re great friends now and have even run a marathon together for charity,” I said. “Who knows? That could be us.” I was babbling, saying anything to alter his mood, to convince him I was a person who cared, and his life still mattered. Then I heard the sound of a train in the distance and knew this was it: the moment he could bolt and throw himself on to the tracks.Time slowed down. There was nothing but me and my incessant chatter. I felt his body tense, saw his eyes swivel downwards. I told him my name, Joey’s name, where I lived, how I was a mother of three, how his life was so big and this was just one tiny part of it, going on and on, desperate to distract him.When the train passed, I let out a sigh. By this time, Tommy’s cries were slowing down and he was stroking Joey under his chin. “He’s a sweet little thing, isn’t he?” he said, his mood lightening. Sensing the danger had passed, I suggested he phone his parents. At first he was reluctant, but I pressed, knowing another train could come any time. “Go on,” I said. “They’ll be worried about you.” He made the call and they arrived soon after, shocked and upset. They scooped him up and whisked him away.When I turned to David, waiting on the path, he told me I’d been sitting with Tommy for 25 minutes. “Is that all?” I said. It felt like hours.I didn’t mention what happened to anyone but thought about Tommy every time I walked Joey across the bridge. Then, one Sunday morning, David greeted me with a smile. He had seen a Facebook post in a community group from someone called Tommy who was looking for the woman and dog who had saved his life.David had messaged Tommy and we arranged to meet the following Wednesday evening in a local pub. He asked me to bring Joey. I was nervous, but as soon as we saw each other we hugged for a good minute and a half. Even though we were strangers, we felt a strong connection. He told me he was on medication and on a waiting list for counselling, which irritated me, knowing how much he needed it now.We’ve met since to take Joey for a walk and we speak every week, bonded by that terrible time on the bridge. After coaxing Tommy to safety, I feel responsible for his future. I want to see him thrive, and live a happy and meaningful life. And if he gets the right help, I know that he can.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

Submit your questions and ideas for our panel of experts to discuss what can be learnt from different approaches to educationDo you have good ideas about education, or want to ask a question about what it could like like in the future? If so, let us know by sharing your thoughts with our panel of education experts to examine what can be done to improve education, and make systems more equal. Whether you’re a teacher, student, academic, social worker, policymaker, parent, and wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.This is what Alex Beard, author of Natural Born Learners, and one of our panellists for this podcast, has to say:“Most schools today are not teaching kids how to learn. We lack a common understanding of what education is and what purpose it serves. We set national targets and arrange institutions and organise people so that they can deliver on those targets. This managerial thinking has been around for 100 years. But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.”In an increasingly interdependent world, it’s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others – be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian – endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month’s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.What are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article ‘It’ll take a village to reform global education’:“More than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math. We’re even further from ensuring the world’s children gain the competencies and dispositions necessary to shape a better future for themselves and all of us.”One thing is clear: the learning crisis is severe. But the conversation on education still needs to shift towards an understanding that this is a crisis that needs fixing – we know where we want to get to, but we don’t yet know how to get there. Of course, what works in one country might not work entirely in another, but recognising that there are other ways to do things might be a good place to start.What are the common issues we all face? What approaches have you seen implemented, or helped to implement, and what beneficial changes have been brought about in the systems you work in?Now we’d like to hear from you.

But a civil war over all that money almost toppled itBy  Jonathan Clegg and  Joshua RobinsonThe Premier League offices in London’s West End are located mostly underground. This fact alone does not make them exceptional in the world of football administration – Fifa’s lair in Zurich features five subterranean levels, including a sinister conference room ripped straight out of Dr Strangelove. But the Premier League isn’t going for the futuristic bunker vibe. Nothing about it exudes Bond-villain hideout or military robotics lab. What makes the place remarkable is its modesty. Premier League HQ feels more like the offices of a mid-sized legal practice.Blending into a row of elegant Georgian buildings with white fronts and black railings, the exterior of the Premier League offices at 30 Gloucester Place is marked only by a small silver plaque. Where it publishes its address, the Premier League points out that access is “by appointment only”. The few people who ever stop to take pictures are the tabloid photographers working the pavement whenever the Premier League managers gather for their league-wide meetings – think photos of middle-aged men in ill-fitting suits emerging from black cabs.When the league moved into the space in 2005, domestic TV rights had just cleared the billion-pound mark for the second successive cycle. Ratings were through the roof. Yet for the most popular league on the planet, the offices have none of the ostentation or scale of, for instance, the NFL’s, perched high above the corner of 51st Street and Park Avenue in New York, or the NBA’s, which are in a skyscraper two avenues over. In part, that’s because the Premier League has roughly 10 times fewer employees than the NFL or NBA, with a head count hovering around 110.Visitors to the home of the world’s most popular league are led downstairs to a small waiting area where the sofas are pointed at the Premier League trophy and a tea station. The atmosphere is one of quiet, businesslike efficiency. Until his resignation this winter, the chief executive, Richard Scudamore, kept a spartan office here, as do the aides who make sure that contracts are up to date, partners are kept happy, and the league’s extensive charity operations tick over smoothly. Scudamore, the Premier League’s highest-paid executive, earned a basic salary in the low seven figures – news of the £5m “golden handshake” he received on his way out caused a brief furore in December. But compare that to the $34m that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell earned in 2016, or the roughly $20m the NBA is believed to pay commissioner Adam Silver, and you wonder why the Premier League – for all of the cash flooding into its clubs – makes its brass look so unassuming.The reason is that the Premier League is a much smaller sporting government than any of its US counterparts. It is first and foremost a media-rights-selling organisation that happens to provide 20 clubs with a platform, referees and a ball. The organisation has six league-wide sponsors – no more – in obvious categories such as official timekeeper and official snack, and a ball contract with Nike that has quietly hummed along since 2000. The NFL, by contrast, had 32 league-wide sponsors in 2015, including an official soup.The most profitable sporting organisation to come out of England isn’t in the business of peddling merchandise either. It won’t sell you a baseball cap or scarf – it leaves that entirely to the clubs. The Premier League’s website does not even have an shop. That’s why the whole operation can be happily contained in a single office that almost nobody knows is there. But ever since 2005, that humble residence at Gloucester Place has served as mission control for the Premier League’s quest for global domination.By the time Scudamore was introduced chief executive in 1999, he could tell the Premier League was already on its way to becoming a domestic juggernaut. Sky had renegotiated its contract for UK TV rights a couple of years earlier, agreeing to pay £670m over four years, more than doubling the value of its previous deal. When Scudamore looked at the international revenues, though, he saw a world of untapped potential. The league’s overseas broadcast rights had sold for just £98m in 1997, a figure Scudamore regarded not merely as disappointing but borderline disrespectful. In his mind, the Premier League was the most exciting football competition on the planet. It was time it got paid like it.His first order of business was overhauling the way the league sold itself abroad. Until then, it had auctioned off its overseas rights package en bloc for a fixed fee, with the winning bidder then free to unpackage those rights and resell them in different countries and territories as they saw fit. He wanted to cut out the middleman and negotiate with broadcasters himself. Scudamore was a man who liked to be in the room. He immediately told the club owners that they stood a better chance of finally raking in what they were worth by breaking up the overseas rights into separate territorial packages and dealing face-to-face with the TV companies. Convinced by his commercial background, the owners signed off on Scudamore’s proposal to become their ambassador to the world.Figures like those would have been inconceivable to the men who founded the Premier League in 1992. They had so underestimated the global appetite that, in the early years of their enterprise, they were the ones paying foreign broadcasters to carry their games, not the other way around. The clamour for rights packages from every corner of the planet now convinced them otherwise.As Scudamore gradually shaped his role into that of a globetrotting executive, making visits to key markets including India, Thailand, Singapore and the Middle East during each new season, he realised that the Premier League product was equipped with a host of built-in advantages. These factors, so obvious in retrospect, meant that fans around the world were predisposed to the Premier League even before they realised it. Best of all, those advantages were a total coincidence. The league had nothing to do with their existence.The first – and most forehead-slappingly simple – is that this whole show takes place in English. While Italy’s Serie A and Germany’s Bundesliga must first help viewers make sense of names like Sampdoria and Borussia Mönchengladbach, one-quarter of the world’s population can tune in to a Premier League and immediately understand what’s happening – even if it means occasionally wading into the absurdly tedious “soccer v football” debate. (For the record, soccer, like football, is an originally British term short for “association football”.) Beyond the language, the league also benefits from its location. As countless London firms have discovered, the fact that the British business day overlaps with both Asian and American daytime hours gave the league a leg up on rival sports organisations, including the NFL and the NBA.A Premier League match that kicks off in the early afternoon can be consumed both as primetime Saturday-night entertainment in Singapore and over a bowl of Cheerios on a Saturday morning in Brooklyn. On top of all of this, it was obvious to Scudamore that overseas viewers had a sort of natural Anglophilia – and were gravitating to the heritage and culture of English football, its authenticity. In short, they craved the Britishness of it all. “Being British is the essence of what we are,” Scudamore told the Times in 2013. “It’s a bit like being the Queen or the BBC.”By the end of his first decade as chief executive, Scudamore had parlayed that headstart into tenfold increase in the value of the league’s international TV rights. Now he had to add some creativity of his own. To keep global rights fees rising, it was no longer enough simply to cut out the middleman and deal with international broadcasters directly. He needed to sell them on the idea that the Premier League rights they had just paid through the nose for were indispensable to their business model. And to do that, Scudamore developed two clear strategies.The first relied on Scudamore’s own talents as a salesman – or, to be more specific, what one Premier League owner described as his talent for “creating tension” at the negotiating table, never letting buyers get too comfortable. If that gives the impression of Scudamore as a sales shark sniffing out weaknesses and exploiting them to push his product, the reality could not be more different. In fact, Scudamore created the most fiendish auction process in world sports by running the league’s sales department with the sort of folksy, homespun charm of a village post office.He purposely kept his sales team to roughly a half-dozen employees so that broadcasters felt a personal connection when they rang Gloucester Place. And the mantra they lived by was less “always be closing” and more “always be courteous”. Scudamore’s unshakeable sense of decorum taught him that politeness was the key to preserving customer relationships. At the end of every season, he personally emailed thank-you notes to the league’s 80 international broadcasters and sent special goodbye messages to those whose contracts with the league had expired. Scudamore also began to accompany the prime minister on trade missions, taking the Premier League trophy with him. “Everyone who sees the trophy will say, ‘Wow’, he explained. “Heads of state, prime ministers – they all want a photo with the trophy. It’s what we like to call soft power.”For two decades, Richard Scudamore’s professional life had been more or less smooth sailing. He promised the 20 owners of the Premier League that he would sell their game around the world, and for 20 years, that’s what he did. But after all of that peaceful coexistence between the clubs, during which English football’s biggest institutions had made money hand over fist, built towering new stadiums, attracted huge global fan bases and transformed themselves into billion-dollar businesses, the Premier League gravy train came to an unexpected standstill in 2018, just as Britain’s trains are wont to do.For the first time in a quarter of a century, it became apparent that England’s top flight – once a model of collective harmony and mutual benefit – was racked by ision of its own the Premier League had split into a morass of feuding factions that were each blaming somebody else for threatening to blow the whole thing up. The big six clubs wanted a larger slice of the pie. The other 14 felt left behind. And the original, 1992 formula for redistributing income – the very thing that underpinned the league’s wild growth – was being challenged.The simmering tensions were mostly kept behind closed doors, in club boardrooms, in executive boxes and in the conference rooms of swanky hotels. Outwardly, it appeared that the Premier League was a picture of strength. The league was resurgent on the European stage, qualifying a record five clubs for the Champions League’s last 16, while negotiations over the latest sale of domestic TV rights meant the clubs were in line for another windfall.But amid this outbreak of unseen hostility, there was one surprise. It turned out that the biggest agitator was the one club that seemingly had the least to worry about. Not content with laying waste to English football on the pitch, Manchester City and its Catalan-Emirati leadership were pushing to overturn the league’s way of doing business.In official league meetings and private discussions with other clubs, City railed against the league’s revenue-sharing model and repeatedly challenged the age-old Founder Members Agreement – a document handwritten in 1991 by Rick Parry, the first Premiership chief executive, that held the status of Premier League scripture. The reality is that when it was written up, no one paid much attention to the overseas income. In fact, the league was losing money on international broadcasts back then as it was paying foreign networks to carry its games. “Nobody envisaged that it would be as big as it is, so sharing those rights equally was a concession they thought wouldn’t matter,” Parry said.The way Manchester City saw it, the Founder Members Agreement was more like a relic that belonged in a glass case with acid-wash jeans, the Sega Mega Drive and other treasured artifacts of the 1990s. The league’s antique formula and its quaint, old-fashioned ideas about competitive balance had allowed the Premier League to become the richest purveyor of the world’s favourite sport. But for a club like Manchester City – whose modern history dated back to only 2008, when it was bought by the Emirati billionaire Sheikh Mansour – that was all in the distant past.In truth, no one should have been shocked to learn that City gave little thought to the overall strength of the league. The club’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, had telegraphed exactly those sentiments a decade earlier in his book about running Barcelona. Midway through a meditation on the differences between professional sport in the US and football in Europe, Soriano laid out his thoughts about the concept of competitive balance.If anything, Soriano’s conviction was even stronger now. The Premier League’s top clubs – like his – needed a greater share of the wealth if they were ever to hope of luring the world’s best players back to England.That much had been made clear to Soriano during the previous summer’s transfer window. It wasn’t that City lacked the funds to compete at the top end of the transfer market, of course. No team in world football spent more in 2017 than the £221.5m of Sheikh Mansour’s fortune that Soriano plunked down on five new recruits for Pep Guardiola’s squad. They weren’t the only big spenders in the Premier League either. In sum, English clubs splurged more than £1.4bn in transfer fees. That was all well and good. The issue for Soriano was that the summer’s headline moves for the best players and the biggest fees had not involved Manchester City. Nor had they involved Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool or any other English club for that matter. The juiciest transfer of the summer belonged to a different superpower in a different league controlled by a different Gulf state. Paris Saint-Germain, backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, blew a world-record €222m on the fleet- footed, flamboyantly coiffed Brazilian Neymar from Barcelona.If that wasn’t bad enough, just a few weeks later, the French teenager widely tipped to be the game’s next global superstar, an 18-year-old forward named Kylian Mbappé, had moved from Monaco for the second-highest transfer fee on record. He had signed for PSG, too.For Soriano, this was a galling development. It was one thing if English clubs had to defer to Real Madrid or Barcelona when it came to signing the game’s most prized players. The two Spanish superclubs had their domestic championships on lockdown, as did Bayern Munich. Players who signed there knew they could spend most of the season beating up on the weaklings that made up the rest of the league, allowing them to conserve energy for the occasional big game, the later rounds of the Champions League, and the serious business of lifting a big trophy above their heads.By contrast, English football was a grind. So Soriano couldn’t blame the likes of Messi and Ronaldo if they chose to spend their careers somewhere more comfortable. But there are only so many world-class players to go around. If Paris Saint-Germain were getting in on the act now, too, that was a problem. And in football, there’s only one surefire way to solve a problem. Soriano knew that if he threw enough money at them, the world’s best players could be persuaded to move to Manchester. Premier League clubs were making more than enough cash for him to do so he just needed to ensure a greater share of it flowed into Manchester City’s coffers at the expense of clubs at the wrong end of the table. It made perfect sense to him. If English football wanted to attract the world’s best players, then who could argue?When Manchester City reached the midpoint of the 201718 campaign with an insurmountable lead at the top of the table, it seemed that the rest of the season might turn into one long victory lap. But if that suggested a Premier League season devoid of suspense, the reality was far different. There was still intrigue, tension and drama out there. You just had to know where to look. For example, in the dining rooms of hip Manhattan restaurants. On a warm night in the middle of October 2017, an incongruous group of diners sat down to eat among the dark wood tables and black leather banquettes at Locanda Verde, a high-end Italian eatery in Tribeca.The group of old white guys with not much hair between them didn’t turn many heads amid the usual gaggle of well-tanned, well-Botoxed VIPs. But if anyone with a keen knowledge of English football executives had passed their table on the way to the toilet, they would have recognised that this party represented the most unlikely gathering of enemies since the heads of New York’s mafia families held their regular meetings in red-sauce joints to keep the peace. Around the table that night were Joel and Avram Glazer, the owners of Manchester Utd, along with the club’s chief executive, Ed Woodward Liverpool’s principal owner John W Henry and Ivan Gazidis, then the chief executive of Arsenal.That these clubs had ended up brushing off more than a century of mutual loathing to sit down to dinner together was due to an emerging crisis that concerned all of them. Over the previous 12 months, the Premier League’s “big six” had jointly reached the conclusion that the exorbitant sums the league were now raking in from the sale of overseas TV rights – currently worth £3.3bn – should no longer be distributed equally among the league’s 20 teams as they had been since the Premier League was first founded 25 years earlier.The way the big six saw it, some clubs deserved a larger share – specifically, them. After all, they were the ones responsible for the league’s explosive global popularity, weren’t they? They were the ones criss-crossing the planet every summer to raise the profile of English football, the ones who boasted of absurd global followings in the hundreds of millions, driving international viewership from Trondheim to Tierra del Fuego. It was only right that they should be compensated accordingly. Nobody in the US or Asia was wrenching themselves out of bed early or staying up late to watch bloody Bournemouth. Unfortunately for the big six, Bournemouth disagreed. So did the likes of Huddersfield, Brighton, Watford and the rest of the league’s smaller clubs. Which is why the executives around the table were slurping their pasta slightly more sombrely than the chef intended.John Henry, seated to the right of Joel Glazer, had come down from Boston to talk things through. Woodward and Gazidis, sitting opposite them, had been called to New York to add their input. But the group around the table knew that any hope of finding the 14 votes they would need to rip up the existing revenue-sharing agreement and draft a new one was all but doomed.Beyond that, the smaller clubs were united in opposition – and their resistance appeared to be a little stiffer than what the big six were used to steamrolling every Saturday afternoon. Within minutes of the topic being broached at the meeting earlier that month, it became obvious to the big six that they didn’t have a path to the 14-vote threshold. At least half of the league’s 20 clubs were not going to budge. The consensus was so strong that Scudamore didn’t even bother asking the clubs to go through the motions of a vote. There was no point. Instead, they had agreed to revisit the issue and try again three weeks later.But now, with seven days to go, the diners at Locanda Verde had to admit there had been no meaningful change. After years of attending Premier League meetings, Woodward and Gazidis had everyone’s voting tendencies memorised as if they were political pollsters. But when Woodward and Gazidis tallied up the two camps, even if every swing vote broke their way, they couldn’t make it work. The league was still gridlocked.Which left Henry, the Glazers and the rest of the big six owners backed into a corner. The Premier League’s revenue-sharing model, the two-thirds majority required for rule changes – these had been core tenets of the league ever since Rick Parry wrote them down on a sheet of Ernst \u0026amp Young notepaper 25 years before. They were the same tenets that had allowed English football to reach its position as the world’s pre-eminent league. But now, in downtown Manhattan, those pillars began to look as if they would have to come down. If the league’s top clubs couldn’t secure a more reasonable revenue split through peaceful means, what option did they have left? Nobody at the table uttered the words “European Super League”, but then, they didn’t need to.‘They threaten it all the time: ‘We’re going to break away,’” said one Premier League owner. “Sometimes they vaguely hint at it, sometimes they outwardly threaten it. But every time they want more money, it’s ‘Well, we’ll just go and play the big European teams.’” The spectre of a breakaway by the big six had been invoked so often during the previous decade that the Premier League now operated in a constant state of high alert, leaving even the most sober observers on edge. Which is how the Times ended up publishing a juicy front-page exclusive in March 2013 outlining secret plans for a Qatar-based “Dream Football League”, a new tournament to be played every two years and featuring 24 of Europe’s elite clubs, including Manchester United and a handful of other top Premier League teams. The DFL had the potential to “change the face of world football”, the Times story noted. Doubtless that would have been true but for one minor detail: the whole thing was a hoax dreamed up by a blogger on a satirical French website.The episode was embarrassing for Britain’s paper of record, but it got one thing right: the desire from forces inside the game to blow up the existing structures and reorganise around the most powerful clubs. In 2018, Fifa president Gianni Infantino was motivated to cook up a proposal for an expanded Club World Cup by an international consortium dangling more than $20bn. At the same time, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli was trying to convince his fellow superclubs to back a larger Champions League that would play on the weekends and shunt domestic league play into midweek.The big six were not shy about expressing their interest. So Scudamore responded the only way he could. Two weeks after the end of the season, he gathered the clubs again at the league’s annual general meeting in Yorkshire. Scudamore had begun to think of the year-long international rights debate as a boil that needed lancing. This time, nothing was off the table.The solution they agreed on distributed roughly one-third of all future international rights fees according to each club’s finishing position, meaning that the big six were almost certainly guaranteed a raise. To assuage the other 14 teams, they agreed that the ratio between the highest earner and the lowest earner’s payments would never exceed 1.8 to 1, a minor increase on the previous ratio of 1.6 to 1. The smaller clubs could tell themselves that the Premier League was still far more equitable than La Liga or Serie A. But as far as thebig six were concerned, they were finally on their way to righting a great injustice. In the interests of peace, the 20 clubs voted for it 18-2, and left Harrogate feeling relieved. But few gave much thought to the precedent they had just set. For the first time in 26 years, they had ratified a change to the Founder Members Agreement, the document that had governed the Premier League since its creation and provided the framework for its remarkable growth. It was as if they had taken a chisel to the Ten Commandments.Scudamore didn’t think the league would need to revisit the issue any time soon, but he wasn’t about to stick around to find out. Within hours of the Premier League’s announcement about the new revenue-sharing model, it followed up with a notice that Scudamore would step down by the end of the year.His battle to quell the big six was behind him. His UK television rights were sold – he had even brought Amazon into the fold by selling them the live streaming rights to a small package of games. And his international television rights were heading for another jackpot haul. It was time to punch out before the whole edifice started to wobble. “The stronger the Premier League is, the more successful the Premier League is, the more international rights go and generate, the more the TV deals go up, the less incentive there is for any of our clubs to go ‘Well, I’m going to leave the Premier League’,” Scudamore said. “The biggest antidote to chaos is a strong Premier League, for our clubs in England. And that’s the bottom line of it.”But he knew all too well that those outside forces would keep chipping away at the Premier League’s raison d’être, that those 20 businesses had less and less in common with one another, and that they might soon wonder why they were in business together at all. Whether those outside forces were investors from the Gulf trying to reshape the game, or even Fifa and Uefa redesigning the formats of club football hardly mattered. It was now clear that the most serious existential threat to the Premier League, itself formed by a breakaway in 1992, was, improbably, another breakaway.This is an edited extract from The Club: How the Premier League Became the Richest, Most Disruptive Business in Sport, by Jonathan Clegg \u0026amp Joshua Robinson, published by Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ecd5387895d5c379a2b0037128832d6bdd6fcf9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6daf115c8fab76cbfbb224493f6b9e36","title":"how brexit unravelled today in focus podcast","story":"In a disastrous week for Theresa May’s Brexit agreement, her former director of strategy, Chris Wilkins, and the ’s Daniel Boffey chart where it all went wrong.

Readers have been debating Brexit the morning after the prime minister survived a confidence vote I think the prime minister just wants to do this “reaching out” as a PR exercise at the end of which she can announce “I tried, but no one else came up with another answer that respects the referendum... So you have accept my deal.”Her notorious rigidity is a major part of the problem. She fundamentally lacks the qualities to move this forward. Although she cannot be removed, she has to be circumvented to allow other options to be explored. SnagaThe purpose of May’s little speech last night was to play to the gallery of Daily Mail readers and to set the scene for blaming Brexit on the Labour Party. At a time when she needed to speak to the nation she was as isive as ever. GiantrobotThis is possibly the most abject failure of the British political system since the civil war. It’s the very definition of a constitutional crisis. The fact that Parliament can claim to have confidence in the government says that Parliament itself is broken. The citizens of the UK need a means of dissolving Parliament. helicanIt appears that May wants to have talks but doesn’t want to concede anything. Of course a second referendum should be on the table. The talks may conclude that it shouldn’t happen, but surely that is the whole point of talks.On Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to meet unless she ruled out no deal, she said, “the door is always open.” Well, there’s no point having an open door if she doesn’t have an open mind. BellaTheCookCorbyn and the shadow cabinet absolutely right to insist the dangerous, flailing and failing May takes no deal off the table before they engage in any talks. May is totally responsible for this disaster and in the power of the DUP whose agenda cares nothing for the well being of the whole nation.The contempt with which May and the likes of Michael Gove talk of Corbyn is disgusting considering the harm created by Tories to our declining economy. They have made us the laughing stock of Europe. SissyJupe20May has no idea how to compromise and isn’t about to start now unless her hand is forced. The opposition parties should now unite behind Corbyn’s refusal to have a dialogue until no deal is taken off the table. At the very least they could extract from her a binding vote on it in the Commons.Ultimately though, we saw yesterday that the DUP can call time on her leadership whenever they want, so I assume they’ll be telling her what to do from now on. smazakIt’s time for Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Otherwise she’s merely trying to share blame. Without some gesture from her to indicate a willingness to actually change something, “nothing has changed”. PaulB1I don’t agree with Corbyn’s stance on Brexit but his insistence on Maybot taking “no deal” off the table is absolutely right. Impossible to talk while this vile dictatorial PM arrogantly refuses to listen to anyone except her rapidly shrinking team of sycophants. darquangeI am absolutely furious, that a bunch of self important, over privileged MPs are trying to strip young people of the same opportunities that I had. Its what you expect from the Tories who have always been the party of grumpy old men and busybodies who want to control everyone else. But what with Labour? SporadicWitIt’s beyond disingenuous to claim that Labour don’t have a plan. During the transition period, Labour want to remain in the customs union and the single market, abiding by the rules of both. Longer terms they seek to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union to avoid tariffs and prevent a hard border in Ireland. That seems like a sensible approach – maintain the status quo, but leave, allowing us time to transition slowly. We would be able to leave the customs union at any time, once we’ve begun the separation process. SharkcustardWell over 500 MPs want a no deal taken off the table. For the first time in this Brexit mess May should show good faith and stop the bullying. If she doesn’t then the short to medium problems will affect those with a bit of money dissatisfied with the increased hassle and cost of travel – and all of the other problems that come with a no deal. Those with no money will be worse off in the longer term. So many of her natural supporters will be immediately affected and they will punish her if her brinkmanship doesn’t work, as it’s only in her power to take a no deal off the table. jonniestewpot"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db9c7187197c1775628d6d71eb865ba7992d7d36/0_160_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5e31f8569fe3241bb6fc0bd9f3e286c","title":"corbyn could face string of resignations if he backs peoples vote","story":"A number of Labour frontbenchers say they would consider their positions if leader backed ideaJeremy Corbyn could face up to a dozen resignations from the Labour frontbench if the party backs a second referendum as a way out of the Brexit crisis.A string of junior shadow ministers have told the  they are strongly opposed to the idea of a second referendum, which they fear would expose Labour to a vicious backlash in leave-voting constituencies.The development follows another tense day of brinkmanship in Westminster between Theresa May and the Labour leader as they seek a way out of the crisis that has engulfed both major parties.Corbyn refused to enter talks with Theresa May on Thursday until she ruled out the idea of a no-deal departure, and demanded that his party’s MPs refuse similar invitations. Later May wrote to Corbyn telling him that ruling out no-deal was “an impossible condition” and calling on him to join cross-party discussions.With no sign of the impasse being broken, pressure is growing on Labour to consider a so-called people’s vote as the UK prepares to leave the EU on 29 March.With Corbyn’s hopes of a general election fading with the prime minister’s narrow victory in the no-confidence vote, some Labour supporters are raising pressure on Corbyn to support a second referendum.A snap poll conducted after the crushing defeat of May’s Brexit plan has found a 12-point lead for remaining in the EU – the largest margin since the 2016 vote.But the  has contacted several senior shadow ministers from constituencies that voted to leave the EU who say they would consider their positions if Corbyn conceded to pressure to back a second referendum.One said: “I would be in a really difficult position if we backed a second referendum. I would have little choice but to stand down if I was to have any hope of retaining my seat and representing my constituents.”Another said they had made their views clear to Corbyn’s office and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer.“I would feel deeply uncomfortable about going into a people’s vote at this stage. Given all the commitments that we made in the general election, we have to carry them out. This concept of blocking Brexit is wrong and would break a link with millions of our traditional voters who expect us to keep our word,” the shadow minister said.Anti-Brexit campaign group Labour for a People’s Vote published a list of 71 Labour MPs who support its cause on Wednesday, and claimed many more were privately supportive.But backbench MPs who have been canvassing opinion claim that number is matched by vehement opponents of a referendum, some of whom would be prepared to break the whip rather than support it.Several shadow cabinet ministers, including the Labour chair, Ian Lavery, and the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, are also sceptical, believing the party’s first priority must be to keep up the pressure for a general election.Lavery made a passionate intervention against a new referendum at last week’s shadow cabinet meeting. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite trade union, has also said it would be a “betrayal” to seek to reverse the 2016 result.Gloria De Piero, the shadow justice minister, told the  she was not in favour of a second referendum. “I stood on a manifesto that promised to respect the referendum result,” she said.Other shadow cabinet ministers, including the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, are more sympathetic towards a second referendum.Labour strategists have not ruled out a free vote on a second referendum, believing that whipping MPs either to support or oppose a referendum would open a deep rift.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said that with no agreed Brexit deal in place, it was unclear what options would be offered on a second referendum – and referendums were the wrong way to resolve the complex situation.“I think they’re terrible ways to make rational decisions,” she said. “And there’s a swathe of the public who would never forgive us.”At a meeting in Hastings, East Sussex, Corbyn remained uncommitted on the idea of a second referendum, saying again that it remained one of several options if an election did not happen.Explaining why he was the only opposition leader not to meet May for one-to-one talks, Corbyn dismissed the cross-party discussions as a “stunt”, adding that May appeared unable to grasp the fact that her withdrawal agreement was now “dead”.“She seems to be prepared to send the country hurtling towards a cliff-edge,” he said.But Labour’s former prime minister Tony Blair said Corbyn was wrong to refuse to meet May.“If, in a moment of national crisis, the prime minister asks the leader of the opposition to come and talk, of course he should,” Blair told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Another former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, called for the Brexit deadline to be extended by a year, as he said the country was now “more ided” than at the time of Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax.MPs should force the government to extend article 50 and then give the public the final say on a renegotiated Brexit deal, he said.Speaking in Edinburgh on Thursday evening, Brown condemned the “paralysed and immobilised” parliament in Westminster and said there was rising anger from the public who wanted to be involved in the decision-making process.The remain lead was extended further when respondents were asked to compare it to May’s withdrawal agreement or the option of leaving the EU without a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b3bcc204d6844226c2090bc995b707944e4aa53/72_65_1571_943/master/1571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=244d147aaa6694783b377bbf4e685513","title":"so what is david cameron really doing now","story":"The tan, the memoirs, the sheds … the former PM’s activities have become fuel for public anger“I wonder what David Cameron is doing today,” tweeted Anneka Rice on Tuesday. “Cotswold pub lunch? Golf?” The TV and radio presenter is not principally known for her political comment, but it was clear, more than 30,000 likes and 5,000 retweets later, that she had captured something of the public mood. As his successor as prime minister endured an unprecedented drubbing in parliament with the rejection of her deal with the EU, where was the man who had set the Brexit boulder careering downhill in the first place?The answer came the following morning, when Cameron, wearing shorts and warmly tanned from a recent family holiday at a £1,728-a-night resort in Costa Rica, was stopped by reporters on the doorstep of his Notting Hill home. No, he said, he didn’t regret calling the referendum, though he did regret losing it. “And obviously regret the difficulties and the problems we’ve been having trying to implement the result.” And off he went for his morning jog, his security car trailing behind him.Anger at Cameron has been widespread since the referendum, as underlined by the response to actor Danny Dyer’s dismissal of him last summer as a “twat” who had scuttled off to Europe “with his trotters up”.Cameron had promised that he would stay on as prime minister to implement the referendum result, but less than three months later, having stood down as PM, he was gone from parliament as well, saying he did not want to be a “distraction” to Theresa May.His principal pastime, in the 16 months since, has been to work on his £800,000 memoirs, as yet untitled and reportedly already topping more than 400,000 words, having purchased a £25,000 designer shed last year in which to put down his thoughts. (He has since bought another one, and a holiday house – to add to his London and Cotswolds homes – in Cornwall.)The book, heavily predicted to round on former friend Michael Gove for backing Brexit, is now more than three-quarters written, he reportedly said in December, “but there’s no great hurry – I want to get it right”. Events have undoubtedly played a part in pushing back its original publication date last year it is now pencilled in for September and friends say he is determined to stick to schedule, but a delay in article 50 could see it set back further.Tapping out his memories, however, has left the chillaxing former PM with plenty of time on his hands – and famously “bored shitless”, according to a friend. He knocked back rumours in November that he was hankering for a return to frontline politics, perhaps as foreign secretary, though he was careful to let it be known he had not ruled out a role in public service in future.But it is notable that, in contrast to his former political ally George Osborne, who edits the Evening Standard full-time as well as his several other roles, and his former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, now head of global affairs at Facebook, Cameron has been happy so far to pursue a lower-profile portfolio career of charitable positions, business roles and lucrative speaking engagements.He is president of Alzheimer’s Research UK and chairman of the National Citizen Service, a skills programme for teenagers, for which he is unpaid – his reported £120,000 an hour fee at the Washington Speakers Bureau goes some way to covering his expenses. With John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, he will co-chair an initiative to set up protected marine areas.Last month it was confirmed that the parliamentary authorities had cleared Cameron to lead a new £750m UK-China investment fund, whose backers include Lord Chadlington, a Tory peer and close friend of the former PM."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79142fb5e8dac197f5d97c5365d39659466d598e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6756b06cac56c871e4613543d842949","title":"find out which brexit deal is right for you","story":"Set out your own red lines on free movement, frictionless trade and other questions, to find out which of the much-discussed Brexit options could get your approval.

The figures are based on collisions that left craters at least 10km (6.2 miles) wide.“The cratering rate changes instantaneously,” said Thomas Gernon, an Earth scientist at the University of Southampton and a fellow of the Turing Institute. “There’s an order of two to three increase in asteroid strikes from 290m years ago.”The findings suggest that the dinosaurs may have been unfortunate in evolving 240m years ago, just as the odds of being wiped out by a stray asteroid were ramping up. It was one of those impacts, on top of other factors, that did for the beasts 66m years ago.Many scientists had assumed that asteroid strikes were a rare but constant threat in Earth’s deep history, but the latest study challenges that belief. “I was surprised to see the change,” said Rebecca Ghent, a planetary scientist at the University of Toronto. “There was no reason to think that the rate would be any higher than in the past.”Writing in the journal Science, the researchers describe how they turned to the moon to examine the violent history of Earth. The Earth and moon are hit by asteroids with similar frequency, but impact craters on Earth are often erased or obscured by erosion and the shifting continents which churn up the crust. On the geologically inactive moon, impact craters are preserved almost indefinitely, making them easier to examine.Using images from Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the scientists studied the “rockiness” of the debris surrounding craters on the moon. Rocks thrown up by asteroid impacts are steadily ground down by the constant rain of micrometeorites that pours down on the moon. This means the state of the rocks around a crater can be used to date it.“When you have a fresh impact you get a lot of large rocks that sit around the crater, but over time they get bombarded by small micrometeorites and are transformed into lunar regolith,” said Sara Mazrouei, the first author of the paper and a planetary scientist at Toronto.The dates revealed that the moon, and by extension the Earth, has suffered more intense asteroid bombardment in the past 290m years than at any time in the previous billion. On Earth there are hardly any impact craters older than 650m years, most likely because they were eroded when the planet became encased in ice in an event known as Snowball Earth.Christian Köberl, director general of the Natural History Museum in Vienna – who was not involved in the study, said that while there appeared to be a rise in asteroid strikes in the past few hundred million years, the lack of craters on Earth older than 650m years “must be homemade, as a result of terrestrial geological processes”.William Bottke, a researcher on the team at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said the uptick in asteroid strikes was probably caused by one or more giant space rocks breaking up in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter about 300m years ago. When asteroids collide they produce a swarm of fragments that can find their way on to collision courses with the Earth or moon. “If the initial breakup is large enough, the increase in impacts can last for hundreds of millions of years,” he said. The question now is whether the rate of asteroid strikes is still rising, or perhaps falling back to a lower level. Either way, Ghent believes there is no cause for alarm. “Because large impacts are very rare in the first place, even if you double or triple the probability they are still very rare,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51131c6aabbec443bb0810622121eae71432d00e/0_340_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0ff649415236799e8249e20f7f38760","title":"east of england local government agency to close brussels office","story":"Decision leaves region, which had received €450m of EU funds, with no voice in EuropeA Brussels office that acts as conduit for hundreds of millions of pounds worth of EU funds for the east of England is to shut because councillors have pulled the plug on the relatively small subsidy they give to it.The closure of the Brussels office of the East of England Local Government Association (LGA) has been described as premature and “ideological” at a time when doubts still persist about the type of Brexit that will materialise.While councils will be able to point to cost savings, supporters of the office blame political motives.“The east of England is strongly conservative in political terms and the truth is that some people have never liked us,” said one official familiar with the office, who described the closure as “cutting off your nose to spite your face”. The official added: “For 20 years they have hated us and this is just a convenient way of closing us down.”Staff at other offices representing English regions and cities fear the closure of one of the oldest and largest representations in Europe will have a domino effect, leaving England with no voice while Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish offices remain during any post-Brexit transition period or if a soft Brexit is agreed.A management committee, including Conservative and Ukip MEPs from a region that voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, will meet on Friday to consider options for retaining the office but is expected to endorse the decision to end the annual £159,000 funding from 52 councils.A briefing document for members of the management committee, seen by the , warned that the decision of the East of England LGA to disinvest in the office will have a “major impact”. It stated that the office is no longer viable even with the continuing support of smaller subscriptions from Anglian Water, and universities and concludes it will be necessary to wind it down from the end of March.The decision contrasts with recent moves by Cornwall to keep a Brussels “embassy” open. While Cornwall benefits from EU funding as a result of being the only English local authority categorised as a less developed region (LDR), the east of England received €450m (£395m) in EU funds between 2014 and 2020 for economic development and regeneration. It got €528m for 2014-2018 to fund research and innovation, mostly at universities.Alex Mayer, Labour MEP for the East of England and a member of the management committee, said: “I’m hugely disappointed by this ideologically blinkered decision by local Conservatives.”“We are putting up a ‘closed’ sign on the east of England.

However Russia had refused to cooperate until Wada’s executive committee controversially decided to lift the suspension of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in September. That decision angered many athletes and other anti-doping agencies – and their frustration only increased when Russia then missed a 31 December deadline to let Wada have the data.However Wada’s president Sir Craig Reedie hailed the news as a “major breakthrough for clean sport” after Wada’s three-strong team of experts finally completed its Moscow mission on Thursday.“It shows we are continuing to make real progress that simply would not have happened without the 20 September ExCo decision,” Reedie added. “The long impasse around access to the former Moscow Laboratory has been broken and that is significantly good news.”However many in the anti-doping world remain sceptical of Russia, with rumours rife that the original data may well have been wiped by the authorities. And Reedie conceded that Wada would now need to “authenticate and review the data to ensure it is complete and that it has not been compromised.“Given the amount of data, that will take some time to achieve but our experts have the tools they need to be able to verify the data with a high degree of confidence,” he said. “Once the data have been authenticated, we will be in a position to proceed to the third phase and support the various sports and other anti-doping organisations concerned to build strong cases against athletes who doped and, as part of that, ensure that certain samples that are still stored in the Moscow Laboratory are reanalysed in an accredited laboratory no later than 30 June 2019.”The Russian Anti-Doping Agency could yet be suspended again because the Russians missed the 31 December deadline.

The Russian said: “I thought the level was quite high. I knew I was going to get a really tough match. I haven’t played a lot of matches in the last year, especially against top players. These are the matches you train for and it’s really rewarding to win the last point.” Wozniacki is the highest-ranked opponent Sharapova has beaten since her first-round victory over Simona Halep at the US Open in 2017. That was her first grand slam tournament back after her 15-month doping ban and at the time seemed to be a sign of the Russian’s impending resurgence. It has not happened that way, though, with Sharapova struggling to find anything like her previous form and also troubled by injuries, with an ongoing shoulder problem prompting her to shut down her season after the US Open last summer. The 31-year-old bristled a little at the suggestion she needed a statement win like this to kick her comeback into gear but there was no doubt she was fired up for this encounter. There is no love lost between the two players. Wozniacki was one of the most outspoken critics of the way Sharapova was welcomed back to the game following her ban, prompting the Russian’s agent Max Eisenbud to brand Wozniacki a “journeyman player”. The Dane began the match the stronger and moved into a 4-1 lead but Sharapova responded, showing how desperate she was to match Wozniacki physically by winning a superb, all-court rally that included a left-handed forehand. She rode a wave of momentum to take the first set and then repeated the pattern by coming from 3-0 down to level the second. Sharapova has been too error-prone over the last 18 months to make the kind of progress she had been looking for but this was a much more measured performance right up until she served at 4-5, when a double fault and two forehand errors allowed Wozniacki to level the match. But Sharapova did not fold, the steel in her eyes showing just how much she wanted to win this one, and a series of ferocious forehands in the seventh game gave her the breakthrough. She celebrated with a huge yell and then broke Wozniacki again to claim victory, finishing with a tally of 37 winners, compared to just 10 for her opponent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98f5ae0406c6dd61fbaf914c4bba2e352a41c53e/0_160_4804_2883/master/4804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bd0f958351279b6abb377392c933443","title":"nfl championship round predictions patriots chiefs saints rams","story":"The four best teams in the NFL play each other on Sunday.

Last time these two teams faced each other, Thomas accumulated 211 yards and scored a key touchdown late on. Last weekend, Thomas went off for 171 yards and yet another touchdown against the Eagles. He will be a factor again.Unheralded players to watch: The kickers. It doesn’t get much more unheralded than being a kicker, but we’ve already seen how important they can be in a winner-takes-all scenario. Just ask poor Cody Parkey, whose blocked field-goal ended the Chicago Bears’ season. So, watch Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein and Saints kicker Wil Lutz. If casual football fans know one of their names after the game ends, that probably means something bad has happened. The usually reliable Lutz, in fact, nearly found himself the Saints’ fall guy with his fourth-quarter miss against the Eagles, but the Saints were able to hold on to win 20-14.What the Patriots need to do: Make Patrick Mahomes look like a playoff rookie. Mahomes had a successful postseason debut against the Indianapolis Colts, but he didn’t have a passing touchdown (although he did rush for one). That didn’t really matter in a comfortable 31-13 win, but that’s not going to cut it against Tom Brady and the Patriots. Every drive in which the Patriots defense can limit the Chiefs to a field goal (or less) will be crucial if this becomes a shootout similar to the teams’ previous meeting.What the Chiefs need to do: Watch the clock. The Chiefs’ Andy Reid is one of the best head coaches in the league, but he’s also notorious for his poor clock management in big games. If Sunday’s meeting ends up being close down the stretch, both teams must use their timeouts wisely and have perfect awareness of how much time is left (or at least glance at the clock on occasion).Key player for the Patriots: Julian Edelman, WR. There are plenty of benefits to being Tom Brady’s favorite target and that includes climbing up the Most Postseason Receptions list. With his 94th postseason reception last Sunday, Edelman moved up to second on the list, passing Reggie Wayne, and he ended the 41-28 blowout with 98. It’s safe to bet that he won’t beat Jerry Rice’s record of 151 but he’s probably a good bet to break the 100 mark this Sunday.Key player for the Chiefs: Damien Williams, RB. You think the Patriots regret not signing Williams? Kansas City’s running game could have taken a stumble when they cut Kareem Hunt. Instead they inserted Williams who has thrived in their system. He is coming off a 129-yard performance against the Colts.Unheralded player to watch: Cordarrelle Patterson, KR, New England Patriots. Patterson is technically a wide receiver, but the Patriots used him as a running back during the regular season when Sony Michel was unavailable. Now that Michel is healthy, as his mammoth game against the Chargers established, Patterson’s biggest impact will be as a kick returner. In fact, Los Angeles brought in a second kicker, Nick Rose, to handle kickoffs and limit Patterson’s chances (he would end up returning just one kick, for 23 yards). In a game that may well come down to the wire, one huge return could end up being key."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40319ac7b351d2373ff7a3224be532d745c14360/0_132_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960af7de249ee294f66873be47346657","title":"alex de minaur v rafa nadal australian open 2019 live","story":"Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 5-4 De Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur holds to love. This has been a drubbing, but at least he’s kept Nadal honest in this set. Nadal will surely serve it out now.Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 5-3 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal moves a game away from victory. De Minaur will serve to stay in the set.Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 4-3 De Minaur* (*denotes server): The game goes to deuce. Somehow De Minaur finds the will to keep landing a few blows. He holds. He’s showing plenty of heart.Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 4-2 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal holds to love once again.Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 3-2 De Minaur* (*denotes server): More “C’mons!” from De Minaur as he holds again. He’s still fighting the inevitable.Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 3-1 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal keeps rolling, holding to love. It will be interesting to see how he deals with the power of Berdych, who crushed him in the quarters in 2015.Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 2-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur holds to love! “Come on!” he cries. That’s good to see. I doubt Nick Kyrgios would be showing so much positivity in similar circumstances.Third set: Nadal* 6-1, 6-2, 2-0 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal consolidates the break. Let’s hope De Minaur is taking some lessons on board.Third set: Nadal 6-1, 6-2, 1-0 De Minaur* (*denotes server): Nadal just won’t step. De Minaur shakes his head after netting a backhand for 15-40. A stinging return from Nadal’s too hot for De Minaur, who sends a limp forehand long.The comeback’s on when Nadal slices wide for 15-30! Then he earns a break point, Nadal pushing a forehand wide for 30-40! Yet the game goes to deuce when the youngster dabs a backhand wide. Nadal seems to have relaxed and gives up another chance with a poor volley. He refocuses and saves the break point with a vicious forehand. De Minaur’s proving a nuisance and he earns a third opportunity when Nadal knocks an unsteady forehand wide. Nadal serves well to save it, before earning his first set point, one he converts when De Minaur sends a return long.Second set: Nadal 6-1, 5-2 De Minaur* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the set, De Minaur rouses the crowd with a lovely forehand winner for 40-15 and an ace to hold. The comeback’s on!Second set: Nadal* 6-1, 5-1 De Minaur (*denotes server): The crowd are sighing like sympathetic parents every time De Minaur misses a shot. Nadal holds easily again.Second set: Nadal 6-1, 4-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): Nadal crunches into a 0-40 lead. De Minaur, fading fast, nets a backhand and Nadal breaks again. Thoughts are already turning to a fourth-round match against Tomas Berdych.Second set: Nadal 6-1, 3-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): Nadal holds to 30. This isn’t much of an event at the moment, even though De Minaur is giving his all.Second set: Nadal 6-1, 2-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur finally stops the rot, holding for the first time since his very first service game. He’s still got a long way to go, though.Second set: Nadal* 6-1, 2-0 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal easily consolidates the break.Fevered speculation about Andy Murray’s retirement plans refuses to die down just days after his early exit from the Australian Open, and his team on Friday were forced to deny that he has already committed to having surgery on his hip. The former world No1 probably will have an operation to resurface the hip bone, using a metal implant, but organisers of the Marseilles tournament from which he has withdrawn made the false assumption in an announcement that he had already decided to do so. A spokesman for Murray said, “No decision has been made about an operation, but he had already decided to withdraw from all tournaments. He will make a further announcement with a week or so.” The Marseilles tournament press release said, “Still suffering from hip, Andy Murray will undergo further surgery and therefore had to forfeit upcoming tournaments, including the Open 13 Provence.”It quoted Murray as saying, “It’s a blow, but I have no choice.”Second set: Nadal 6-1, 1-0 De Minaur* (*denotes server): De Minaur desperately needs to hold here. Nadal is like a dog with a very juicy bone, finding his range with a forehand to make it 30-40. De Minaur resists the inevitable, leaping into a backhand to save the break point. Nadal earns another chance, only to make a rare error with a forehand. Another opening comes and goes. So we’re locked at deuce for a while. As the game ticks past the 10-minute mark, De Minaur sprays a forehand winner down the line. Nadal hits back with a stunning forehand down the line. They continue for another five minutes. Nadal earns his fifth break point of the game. De Minaur crashes a forehand long. He’s trying so hard, but Nadal is relentless.It now seems that the Marseille organisers jumped the gun. Andy Murray’s camp are insisting he’s made no decision on having hip surgery yet.Serving for the set, Nadal lets De Minaur have the first point. Then he gets down to business, carving out two set points. He serves wide and De Minaur nets a forehand return. That escalated quickly.First set: Nadal 5-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): The game goes to 30-all. Nadal’s on the prowl, pushing De Minaur deeper and deeper. De Minaur somehow gets two smashes back, but Nadal does the job with the third to make it 30-40. Nadal stops in the next rally, saying De Minaur’s backhand has gone long. Hawkeye agrees. This has gone flat. Nadal has skipped into a very commanding lead.Seems the stubborn Scot is going to do everything he can to save his career. He’s pulled out of Marseille and is going under the knife again.First set: Nadal* 4-1 De Minaur (*denotes server): De Minaur sets about showing he’s not going to roll over, meeting a Nadal lob with a lovely backhand overhead for 0-15. Yet Nadal makes off with the next three points. An ace is enough for a comfortable hold.First set: Nadal 3-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): After threatening to break in the previous game, De Minaur finds himself in a little bit of trouble here, a couple of errors making it 15-30. Nadal, so experienced, decides his time to unwind that forehand - and he sends one fizzing past De Minaur for 15-40. Another one down the line is enough to force De Minaur to knock a forehand long. The first break goes Nadal’s way.First set: Nadal* 2-1 De Minaur (*denotes server): After the first two points are shared, there’s a murmur in the crowd when Nadal double-faults for 15-30. Nadal pulls it back to 30-all, but De Minaur earns a break point when a very good backhand forces a scrambling Spaniard to hook a forehand long for 30-40. They rally for a while, trading backhands – and then Nadal knocks a forehand long! Or does he? Nadal, frowning, challenges – and the ball was on the line. Oh. Replay the point! Nadal serves wide and De Minaur blocks a backhand return wide. Still, De Minaur is playing some magnificent tennis, and this game is taking for ever. The rallies are going deep and the youngster’s rising to the challenge. Outlasting Nadal isn’t easy, though, and the Spaniard eventually holds.First set: Nadal 1-1 De Minaur* (*denotes server): “C’mon!” cries De Minaur after coming out on top of a baseline duel at the start of the net, Nadal netting a forehand for 15-0. The camera picks out Lleyton Hewitt, Australia’s Davis Cup captain, who’ll be feeling concerned when this game goes to 30-all. Nadal’s started well and he earns a break point when De Minaur sticks a backhand into the net. A grinding baseline duel ensues and, surprisingly, it’s Nadal who blinks first, shanking a backhand into the crowd, where someone fluffs the catch. How embarrassing. Nadal earns another chance with a trademark drop shot, but De Minaur stands firm again. De Minaur is scrambling hard. Nadal is hitting the ball harder. He earns a third chance. Then a fourth. De Minaur, who has a lot of miles on the clock already this week, looks tight. But he gees himself up when Nadal nets a forehand return. Eventually he olds. “Yuuuuurrggghhhhhh!” De Minaur cries.First set: Nadal* 1-0 De Minaur (*denotes server): Nadal, wearing an orange vest, opens the serving. De Minaur, wearing a red t-shirt, won the toss and chose to receive. But he doesn’t get much of a look at first, Nadal gambolling into a 30-0 lead. De Minaur steps it up and goes for a huge forehand winner, but Nadal mounts a challenge and finds it was wide. 40-0. Nadal follows with a double-fault, but the game’s done when De Minaur nets a backhand.Tok! Tok! Tokity tok! They’ve had their warm-up. Rod Laver’s in the crowd. We’re about to begin.The players are out on court. Alex de Minaur is going to have plenty of support today. I doubt that’s going to affect someone as focused as Rafa Nadal, though.Kevin Mitchell, our man in Melbourne, was in position to watch Roger Federer thrash Taylor Fritz earlier.Hello. Ten years on from Rafa Nadal’s first and only Australian Open title, the sense is growing that time is catching up with the Spanish legend. Though he won yet another French Open to move up to 17 grand slam titles, three behind that Swiss chap who simply refuses to retire, he struggled with injuries for much of 2018 and had an awkward start to the new season, a thigh strain forcing him to withdraw from Brisbane and disrupting his preparations for this tournament. Doubt hung over him as he made his way to Melbourne.It probably still does – Nadal will need a few more solid performances before he totally extinguishes the uncertainty. But at least there haven’t been any slips so far just yet. Consecutive wins over two Australians, James Duckworth and Matthew Ebden, have allowed the 32-year-old to build confidence and momentum. For the time being we can still dream of Federer and Nadal meeting in the semi-finals (Federer’s progress continued earlier today, a comfortable win over Taylor Fritz setting up a fourth-round match with Stefanos Tsitsipas).But having dispensed with two home favourites already, Nadal is likely to face a sterner examination against the player many Australians regard as the new Lleyton Hewitt. Alex de Minaur, 19 years old and precociously talented, has emerged as the great white hope of men’s tennis in Australia in the past year, especially now Nick Kyrgios mania is becoming a bit passé, and the youngster’s speed, hustling skills and shot-making abilities will give him a chance of reaching the fourth round of a slam for the first time in his short career. Born in Sydney to a Uruguayan father and a Spanish mother, De Minaur moved to Alicante when he was five years old, giving him a good appreciation of just how much esteem Nadal is held in Spain. “Rafa is pretty much like the king in Spain,” he says – and he had to bow to Nadal’s brilliance when they met in the third round of Wimbledon last year. But, having beaten Pedro Sousa in three sets in the first round and survived a tough five-setter with Henri Laaksonen on Wednesday, the 29th seed shouldn’t shrink this time. If he plays without fear, this could be very interesting. Nadal wasn’t totally convincing against Ebden and although it’s likely the world No2 is about to disappoint the home fans for the third time this week, he won’t underestimate the young pretender’s threat.Play begins at: 8am GMT, 7pm in Melbourne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b07d34f9a65fcff95cc179968d86f4eba425901/0_97_3808_2285/master/3808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f0679988c9184a55ebc0adea47ad0ee","title":"australia v india third one day international live","story":"We’re seeing lots of frames. Dhoni pulls Richardson, hard, but straight at mid-off. Finch lets the catch burst through his fingers, and injures himself into the bargain. It was travelling at a rapid rate. He at least stopped it going for four, then the return nearly catches Jadhav at the non-striker’s end. Stoinis collects the ball and knocks the stumps with his forearm, legitimately, but after a million replays the third umpire determines that Jadhav was in by a fraction when the stumps lit up. If we’d had the 1000fps camera on that call, it might have been different, but on one frame he was out of his ground with the stumps intact, and on the other he was in with them broken.47th over: India 204-3 (Dhoni 74, Jadhav 46) Richardson the bowler Jadhav squats, digs a hole, squeezes one out. No, he’s not having a moment to himself in the forest, he’s defusing a yorker at ground level after initially shaping to sweep. Gets a run, the start of a picket fence sequence as they take one from each ball of the over. Jadhav nearly holes out off the fifth, sweeping again, but Maxwell sprinting in from deep midwicket sees the ball dip and drop short. Crowd number is 53,603. Good for an ODI these days.India need 27 in 18 balls.46th over: India 198-3 (Dhoni 71, Jadhav 43) Siddle returns, and it does not work out. Two wides down leg, either side of a ball that Jadhav slams down the ground for four. Airborne and just to the left of mid-off, but there’s no catch. Two more from a yorker squeezed out behind square leg, and Jadhav hits Siddle from behind as the batsman runs back for the second. A couple of singles follow.The over costs 11. A target of 44 off 30 has become 33 off 24. Lovely email in from Christopher MacLehose. “Coming to the end, one way or the other, of India in Australia, so just time to thank you and your brilliant colleagues for a vastly pleasurable coverage of the Tests too. Anent your reference to Sam Beckett in the last Test, as you might not know, he was at Lord’s one first day of a Test with John Calder his publisher and one other: glorious sunlit day, the outfield mown to perfection, the game on a knife-edge, one of his companions said: it makes you grateful to be alive. Beckett said: I wouldn’t go so far as that. Warm wishes from frozen France.”45th over: India 187-3 (Dhoni 70, Jadhav 35) Single, single, then Dhoni blocks Stoinis. He’s faced 100 balls now – how many have been dots? Not the 101st, as Dhoni pulls it very fine, and Stanlake’s e can only richochet it into a different part of the rope.That was almost another three. CricViz analysts have confirmed my suspicion from earlier: this match has had the most threes of any ODI at the MCG since 1999.I mean, my suspicion wasn’t that specific. I just thought there had been lots.44th over: India 179-3 (Dhoni 64, Jadhav 33) Zampa. He’s been tidy. He’s looked decent. He’s conceded 33 runs from nine overs. But he hasn’t been a wicket-taking threat today. One more over until his day is complete, and Dhoni has decided to see him off. Forward defence, forward defence. The crowd jeers, or cheers? I think they’re enjoying the ridiculousness, as Dhoni blocks a third, a fourth, a fifth. Finally he helps a single round the corner.One run from the 44th over of an ODI. Absurd.Zampa ends with 0-34, meaning Australia’s specialist spinners didn’t take a wicket in this three-match series.43rd over: India 178-3 (Dhoni 63, Jadhav 33) Good bowling. Stoinis jags one in, takes the edge of Dhoni’s bat and nearly chops on to the stumps. Dhoni takes a couple more balls to compose himself, then chops away to third man for a three.42nd over: India 173-3 (Dhoni 59, Jadhav 32) Just the two singles from Richardson’s over, five of those balls to Dhoni with the DRS review in the middle.India need 58 from 48.Struck on the pad by Richardson... No inside edge but probably too high, after the ball beat the batsman’s defensive stab on the back foot.And so it proves. Clearing the bails, just. Australia had to, this game has almost slipped away entirely.41st over: India 171-3 (Dhoni 58, Jadhav 31) Six from the Zampa over in risk-free style. This more positive MSD is great to watch. Finds a brace with some good running, along with four singles. There’s a brilliant sunset breaking out over the MCG as well.40th over: India 165-3 (Dhoni 54, Jadhav 29) Stanlake may be tiring, as Jadhav milks him effectively. A couple here, a couple there. India need 66 off 60.Amod Paranjape emails in. “Threat of spin. Is the Australian World cup opener against Afghanistan going to result in a huge upset?” It’s not beyond the realm. Australia can’t play the slow stuff well in this format at the moment. And every other team in the world is tending to load their line-ups with at least a couple of specialists, while Australia sometimes goes without one at all. Things could get ugly for the green and gold in England come June.39th over: India 159-3 (Dhoni 53, Jadhav 24) The runs are back to flowing as Stoinis takes the ball. A wide, a top edge from Dhoni for a couple, then Jadhav slots a full ball straight down the ground for four. Mid-on was up so the batsman went over him. Nine from the over. It was always likely to prove the case but Australia just didn’t get enough...38th over: India 150-3 (Dhoni 50, Jadhav 19) Better over from Stanlake, pinning Jadhav down for a while and conceding three singles. But the last of those takes MSD to a half-century.Wrap your head around this: he has seventy ODI fifties. That’s ridiculous. Though now somebody will probably start potting him for conversion rates.37th over: India 147-3 (Dhoni 48, Jadhav 18) Three singles from Stoinis, then the last ball of the over sees Jadhav have a wild mow. It takes a top edge over Carey for four. 36th over: India 140-3 (Dhoni 46, Jadhav 13) Not quite the over of control Australia wanted from Stanlake. Another wide, and Dhoni gets him away through cover for another three. India firming with each over that goes by.35th over: India 133-3 (Dhoni 42, Jadhav 11) Look out, Dhoni has the lid off against Zampa. He’ll remove his headwear at the drop of a hat. And when hats drop in this town, he means business. He takes his hat off like any other man: but when his hat is off, he wins run chases.You bet. Kohli is the more aggressive and still probably the more impulsive. Dhoni averages 49.9 in run chases in one-dayers.In winning run chases, he averages 99.85.And out of 72 times he’s batted in a winning run chase, he’s been there at the end 45 times.34th over: India 129-3 (Dhoni 39, Jadhav 10) Stanlake to Jadhav, a couple of dots to start. We have 100 balls left in the innings now, and 108 runs required. So Australia have narrowed then inverted that gap, and can definitely still bring pressure to bear. Another wicket, a few more quiet overs, either would make things difficult. Jadav blocks out a yorker for a run. Dhoni shuffles and pulls one more. Stands at the non-striker’s end wrapping and re-wrapping the velcro on his gloves, then watches Jadhav lean back and crack a cut shot for four. 102 needed from 96.33rd over: India 123-3 (Dhoni 38, Jadhav 5) Zampa nearly slides through onto Jadhav’s stumps, but the batsman gets down just in time. Then he drops to one knee to slog two runs wide of long-on.32nd over: India 120-3 (Dhoni 38, Jadhav 2) Four balls for Jadhav to get away from Richardson, pulling a short ball for a single. Another short ball is called wide, and another. Just the one run from the bat in that eight-ball over though.“With the Australian tour drawing to a close, I would like to say that for the away Indian matches, it has been heartening to see the new Indian broadcasters (Sony Network) have been more involved in proper analysis and decent opinions along with less affinity for the theatrics compared to the channel which broadcasts matches played in India.“Along with the presence of people like Sunil Gavaskar who have strong opinions yet not an imposing personality, and Harsha Bhogle between the shared commentary box and radio calling, the experts’ opinions have been pleasant to hear. I hear the same has happened in Australia. After a long lull where muting the telly was more entertaining than listening to India’s home ‘experts’, is this the period of the Experts’ Renaissance?”One can only hope so. The monotony of every broadcast being entirely staffed by former cricketers, with plenty lacking the facility to make good broadcasters, is so far below par. Hopefully the recent trend towards some level of balance is maintained and increased.31st over: India 117-3 (Dhoni 38, Jadhav 1) Stanlake is immediately back to try to rough up the new batsman Kedar Jadhav. He does alright though, blocking a couple and getting off strike.Finally! Australia land the biggest fish! He’s been wrestling at the end of the line all night but now he’s on the deck. Richardson got him in Sydney. Now Richardson bowls wide outside off, just back of a length. Kohli steps into it and drives, but again the bounce is too much, taking the edge high on the blade and Carey moves across. Richardson is pumped up, he’s found an edge over the best on the planet.That was the last ball of the over, one ball after Richardson had drawn a thicker edge for a couple of runs to third man.29th over: India 109-2 (Kohli 43, Dhoni 34) Streaky from Dhoni! He charges Siddle and aims to k one over cover. Instead he gets a top edge over the keeper. Dhoni whips around to see where it’s gone, but gets to see it elude Carey’s glove by a couple of feet. Undeterred, Dhoni charges again, and this time Siddle cuts the ball back through him between bat and body and it’s a dot ball.Was that an inside edge? Maxwell appealed from point. Siddle asked politely. Carey shrugged and said no. But Hot Spot picks up the faintest gleam of a nick as the ball passes blade. Goodness me. They could have overturned that. Are we up to five chances given to Kohli and Dhoni tonight?28th over: India 104-2 (Kohli 42, Dhoni 30) Jhye Richardson returns, and he’s on the mark immediately. Nice tight line around the off stump, red-ball bowling. Dhoni does some red-ball batting, blocking out a maiden. Time on their side, he’s happy to wait. 27th over: India 104-2 (Kohli 42, Dhoni 30) Desperation running from Dhoni, and this time I think he’s gauged one right. Walks at Siddle, stabs the ball straight down to mid-on, but correctly gauges that he’s far enough down the wicket already that he’ll make it, and that Kohli without that start will be running to the safe end. They make it, Shaun Marsh flat on his face after underarming at the stumps from close range. Dhoni adds three through midwicket later in the over.Run-outs aside, I’ve been on Kohli Average Watch. And with a single to move to 42, his ODI average goes back to 60.26th over: India 98-2 (Kohli 40, Dhoni 26) Dhoni still unsure against Zampa. Three balls for a single this time, while Kohli faces the other three balls in the over to score 2, 1, 1.25th over: India 93-2 (Kohli 36, Dhoni 25) It’s pretty much an India home game at the MCG tonight. The bottom bays everywhere bar the Members are decked out in blue with tri-colour flags waving. They simmer as Dhoni flicks Siddle for two, then heave as Dhoni pulls him for four. The former skipper has a better balance in working runs so far tonight, as opposed to Sydney in Game 1 where he soaked up something like 60 dot balls out of 90 faced. We’re at the halfway mark. 150 balls left, and only 123 runs needed. India’s game to lose, but Australia can still get into it.24th over: India 85-2 (Kohli 35, Dhoni 18) Zampa keeping the brakes on against Dhoni: four balls for one single. Kohli tries to beat cover but Maxwell goes flying across to slap down the ball, wanting to make up for that earlier lapse in the field. 23rd over: India 83-2 (Kohli 34, Dhoni 17) So many jitters out on that field. Dhoni tries to calm them by walking at Stoinis and swatting him back past mid-on for four. A straight-bat swat, a back-foot drive while leaning back for power to a length ball.22nd over: India 78-2 (Kohli 33, Dhoni 13) And they’ve nearly done it again, India. Nearly cocked it up between the wickets. Kohli jams out to backward point and is watching the ball, so he doesn’t see Dhoni come three quarters of the way down the pitch. Kohli goes back before Dhoni can come through, so Dhoni turns back as well. A throw to the bowler would have him cold, but Khawaj goes to the keeper first, who relays to Zampa, who fumbles the half-volley but flicks it back to the stumps expertly. Even with a clean take, Dhoni would have been just back in his ground. 21st over: India 76-2 (Kohli 32, Dhoni 12) Down to mid-off from Dhoni, and Australia miss a run-out! Oh, come off it. Virat Kohli, the hardest batsman in the world to dismiss in this format, almost gave his wicket away. Offered it up. Dhoni clunked straight to the field and took a couple of steps. I don’t know if Kohli was just responding to that cue, but he started down the wicket as well, then had to turn back. He was so far out of his ground that he gave up and just watched the throw from mid-off. But Richardson scuffed it into the dirt and wide of the stumps on the bounce. Had more time than he realised.So Australia have given up two chances to dismiss Kohli and one for Dhoni so far. Defending 230. No bueno.20th over: India 73-2 (Kohli 32, Dhoni 9) There’s another three. Zampa, short, and Kohli is back in a flash to drop his knees wide and carve his cut shot behind point. Can’t get enough pace across the turf though, so Stanlake is able to put in a fine chase and slide from deep cover point where he’s stationed. Dhoni, from the next five balls, can’t get Zampa away. Blot, blot. Eventually Zampa feels sorry for him and bowls a half-tracker, but Dhoni only pulls it into this thigh pad for a dot ball. So Zampa generously dishes up a big full toss outside off... and Dhoni carves it to the one outfielder on that side of the wicket for a single. A battle of courtesies. 19th over: India 69-2 (Kohli 29, Dhoni 8) You don’t see a lot of threes in ODI cricket these days, but they’re flowing tonight with the field up and the outfield slow. Fine leg, deep midwicket, third man are the only three back for Dhoni against Stoinis. Dhoni gets his three through cover.18th over: India 65-2 (Kohli 28, Dhoni 5) That looks good from Dhoni, driving Stanlake for three. Gets the strike back, and can-cans across the stumps with a Moulin Rouge kick in order to pull a short ball just past short midwicket for a single.17th over: India 60-2 (Kohli 27, Dhoni 1) Now what’s this? What’s this? Here comes MS Dhoni batting at No4. Rohit Sharma called for him to come up the order. Dhoni is in the role his teammate suggested. Can he do something with it after finishing off the chase in Adelaide?Calamity again for Australia. And it’s Maxwell, normally the best set of hands in the side, who takes miracle snares out at deep midwicket. This time it’s a simple one at backward point, a cut shot straight to him, and somehow the ball goes in and pops out. Maxwell and Stoinis both have anguish on their faces. There’s been so much focus on Maxwell’s position in this team and the Test side that perhaps it’s thrown off his concentration.The very next ball, Stoinis hits the pad and goes up in a huge appeal! Not out. Then Dhoni gets off the mark with an edge to third man. What an over from the all-rounder.Stoinis strikes with his second ball! A nothing push at the ball from Dhawan, spliced it straight back at the bowler who snares it in his follow-through and then hurls the ball way up into the air in celebration. Dhawan has been out there for a while, pottered along at a strike rate of 50, and now has given it up tamely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d387615cd1164bbb2741026a2e6a388e6244db4/609_196_887_532/master/887.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=938e459d7007428152f2829c07a8ff2e","title":"liv little its a big thing for a black woman to see yourself reflected back","story":"Women of colour need their own space, which is why Liv Little set up gal-dem. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we explore how she started a culturequake that’s been felt throughout the media ever since. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithLiv Little walks into Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour office with a smile that is as big and bright as her red puffer coat, impressive considering how exhausted she is. We’re here to discuss the rise of women and non-binary people of colour in media, an industry in which Little has emerged as a bright new star. It’s the reason we asked her to be part of the  Labs’s and Google Pixel 3’s Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, where innately curious people discuss how they discover the extraordinary all around them. Little collapses into the waiting arms of a slouchy upholstered chair, humbly receiving congrats on the runaway success of her independent digital and print zine, gal-dem, from a producer who has popped in to say hi.In a year that has been “Feminist AF”. In the age of #MeToo, self care, #BlackGirlMagic and #GirlsDoingWhateverTheFuckTheyWant, it’s not surprising that 2018 has also been the year of Little and gal-dem. It’s hard to find a young woman who better sums up the cultural shift. Her publication, with a corrective emphasis on intersectional feminism, is produced by a team of outspoken, socially conscious, whip-smart young women and non-binary people of colour, from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. It’s a refreshing change from the publishing world’s longstanding homogenous population of largely white, mostly cisgender, predominantly privileged and Oxbridge-educated citizenry.“I wanted to connect with other women and non-binary people of colour. I wanted it to be a free space where people can come and read about experiences like their own,” Little explains of gal-dem’s beginnings. “I realised that it’s a big thing for a black woman to see yourself reflected back.”Add Little to the list of young women interrogating and disrupting historically white, tough-to-break-into professions globally – women such as the newly elected 29-year-old Latinx US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the black British book publisher Sharmaine Lovegrove.Little and gal-dem reflect the moment as much as they are the moment. And their rise coincides with a new wave of women and non-binary people of colour who felt their voices were not being heard in the everyday, so did something extraordinary to get it out there – notably carving space for themselves in the UK media world including Slay in Your Lane authors Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené, journalist Afua Hirsch and the influencer and body positivity activist Chidera “The Slumflower” Eggerue.Meanwhile, gal-dem’s growing team of more than 15 editors, writers and assistants have been juggling projects that rival those of legacy publishing giants with exponentially larger staffs – a truly extraordinary achievement. There was the takeover of the  Weekend Magazine in August, during a month when black women ruled the September glossy monthly covers. And then there was the summer launch of gal-dem’s partnership with Liberty London and Dialogue Books to create a literature course, aptly titled Rewriting the Canon and dedicated to iconic authors of colour. Add to that an exhibition they curated in June about the Windrush generation for City Hall and a week-long pop-up with Penguin in November to celebrate the launch of Michelle Obama’s global phenomenon of a book, Becoming. The pop-up featured events that centred on various themes in the former first lady’s memoir – from a discussion about black motherhood to a talk with businesswoman and activist Gina Miller.This hardly scratches the surface of the long list of wins gal-dem has had since Little first launched the project as a student at the University of Bristol back in 2015.Little had an “overwhelmingly positive” childhood, growing up in south-east London with a close relationship to her Buddhist mother and human rights worker aunt (her mum’s identical twin). She didn’t experience the negative and isolating aspects of being a woman of colour navigating white environments until she started university, where she studied politics and sociology. “My childhood was very much about me being comfortable enough to know that my voice is as important as anyone else’s. And then I went to uni and saw a disparity in circumstances that I had never seen before. I was around the super elite for the first time – people who had cards with family bank names on them, people with very conservative beliefs. It was different from what I was used to back home with my mum’s erse roster of friends. I was in a place where I was studying things and suddenly I had this feeling of: ‘Why is there no space for me?’”It was a question women of colour were asking the world over – using everyday, free platforms such as Instagram to create and market the kinds of extraordinary imagery and storytelling they wanted to see, but couldn’t find in mainstream media. And so gal-dem became the UK’s biggest success story in what emerged as a global wave of independent upstarts by women and non-binary people of colour, including Well Read Black Girl – a US-based online book club and content platform-turned Brooklyn literary festival – and Azeema Mag, an annual print zine dedicated to women within the Menasa region (Middle East, north Africa and south Asia).Now, gal-dem is not just a space for Little, but hundreds of contributors around the world, with content that is as erse as its readership. A scroll through the site reveals stories and news that feel very much like the charged WhatsApp threads taking place between women of a certain mindset – outspoken, socially conscious women who identify with prominent outspoken, socially conscious women such as Roxane Gay, Tracee Ellis Ross, Michaela Coel and Yara Shahidi. The articles on gal-dem have titles such as Are you a woke pixie dream girl?, Why Solange is my style icon, and The sex-deprived lives of young women who move back home. The tone strikes a balance that’s difficult to achieve between critical and cheery, knowing and earnest. And it resonates with women of all backgrounds. “I’ve received a lot of emails from white mothers saying that it’s been a really useful resource to help them understand their daughters. And I get a lot of young people asking me what to do to start a magazine,” she says.That leads us to the other extraordinary part of Little’s trajectory that she’s a media success story at a time when the industry is having an identity crisis. “It’s hard because the media is not always the nicest industry to be in and progress through. The environment can be hostile,” Little says, before thinking back to her time navigating jobs at television networks. “I’ve been in situations where I was the only person in the room who looked like me. You can find yourself tokenised.”But for the past year, she’s made gal-dem her full-time job – with the exception of freelance roles as contributing editor of Elle UK and a factual executive producer at the BBC – devoting all of her energy to turning her platform into a viable business. Does it sound like an empire in the making? For Little, it’s all to play for. “It’s now just a case of growing it further,” she says. And with that, a second producer comes in to greet her. It’s time to go on-air.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e1bba62242f4d4b1151f704750caba197bbc4d1/468_280_931_559/master/931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35df8e0deb678d05d382907db0db173","title":"how fashion got woke the slumflower and the new breed of influencers","story":"There’s been a sea change in social media, from idolising the perfect to finding the extraordinary in the everyday. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we find out why no one embodies that more than influencer Chidera Eggerue. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithAt first glance, the words “woke” and “fashion” don’t exactly seem to have much in common. But some time between the former’s emergence in progressive black circles in the US as a term to describe social, political and racial awareness in the early aughts and its co-opting by the internet mainstream as a slang catchall in the 2010s, it became the fashion in fashion. An extraordinary term that became everyday. In 2016, MTV actually added “woke” to its list of 10 words you should know.The proof is in the wave of catwalk political statements that started with designers such as Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior and Prabal Gurung reviving the protest slogan tees made famous by Katherine Hamnett in the 1980s. This spirit of activism continues apace with model bookers taking a more considered, erse approach to casting that’s beyond tokenism: from the cornrowed Sudanese model Adut Akech walking the Valentino runway and Kenyan born Halima Aden in hijab at MaxMara, to trans model Jessica Espinosa walking for Louis Vuitton and the reappearance of older supers, such as Stella Tennant at Salvatore Ferragamo.Meanwhile, the influencer corners of Instagram went from aspirational street style, carefully filtered selfies and designer outfits to spaces leaning more towards activism, where a new class of equally well-dressed but notably less filtered women began opening up about their flaws with candour. These everyday women advocated for greater body positivity, equal pay and more meaningful ersity.Scroll through Instagram on any given day and you’ll see original fashion influencers such as Tamu McPherson declaring Black Lives Matter and Susie Bubble encouraging her followers to exercise their right to vote. Or model Adwoa Aboah revealing her struggles with addiction and mental health. Or actress Yara Shahidi demanding tighter gun control. But perhaps no one embodies the sea change from unheralded to everyday heroine more than Chidera Eggerue. Better known as The Slumflower, Eggerue is a Nigerian-born south Londoner who’s used her fashion blog to interrogate and dismantle rigid, age-old standards of beauty.It helps that Eggerue’s rise coincided with a general backlash against the false, Facetuned perfection that had been so pervasive on social media channels such as Instagram – and a shift towards iniduality and authenticity. “I do feel that I am a new breed of fashion influencer because I’m contributing to changing the way people view themselves, and I think how you view yourself influences the types of decisions that you make,” she says.Eggerue chose the name The Slumflower after a project by the same name that was created by menswear collective Street Etiquette about a rose growing from concrete – or, in Eggerue’s case, a young girl growing up in Peckham. “Beautifully growing, glowing and flourishing in an environment that appears to promote the opposite,” she says.Eggerue recalls reading fashion magazines as a child and being struck by the homogenous depiction of glamour on the pages. “The imagery perpetuated a narrow definition of beauty, which is why I had to create #saggyboobsmatter,” she says of the hashtag she launched last year that grew to become a movement.“It impacted me because it made me feel like I was never going to be good enough and that I had to be a particular type of woman in order to receive the type of love that is glorified – you know, men professing their love with grand gestures for these beautiful women who look so ine and perfect,” she says. “I always felt like I’m not ine or perfect, so that means I’m not going to get the love I want. And if I do want that love, I’ll need to look different.”Her breasts became a lightening rod. “They were the main issue because when I’d go out to get bra fittings done, the models on the packaging never looked like me. Their boobs didn’t look like what my boobs looked like. So, even when I’d get the bra that was being pushed in my face, I still wouldn’t have the desired result, so it created a complex in my mind,” she says.Eventually, she realised the only way to conquer it was to own the very qualities she initially viewed as flaws. “It forced me in the direction of having to be content with my own beauty, because if I didn’t do that I would be living and walking in a shadow of myself. I wouldn’t have known joy or what it’s like to feel confident in myself. I wouldn’t have known that the world is definitely not going to come to an end,” she says. “In fact, the world will come to an end if you refuse to accept yourself, because all you’ll know is a version of yourself that other people have told you to be and why do those people have authority over who you are?”The message behind the #saggyboobsmatter movement resonated on social media, generating more than 8,000 Instagram posts from women around the world sharing their own everyday body narratives in response to Eggerue’s extraordinary honesty. The pace with which the hashtag spread was proof that social media’s cult of perfection had lost its lustre.When Victoria’s Secret received criticism for a fashion show that relied on tired, reductive and restrictive notions of female sexuality, it was Eggerue’s hashtag that journalists referenced as an example of how times have changed. Women no longer aspire to Barbie doll proportions and Kardashian-esque curves.Eggerue’s profile has grown alongside a community of like-minded, equally prominent women on social media such as the trans model and activist Munroe Bergdorf @munroebergdorf and influencer Megan Jayne Crabbe @bodyposipanda, an attractive woman of size known for posting videos in which she joyfully twerks, shakes and rolls her ample love handles, hips and thighs.“I’m never going to stop talking about Munroe because she shows up so boldly,” she says. “She’s tenacious, courageous and paves the way for other women and I just think her presence is so important in modern society. I can’t imagine where I would be without knowing she existed. And Megan opened up a massive conversation about beauty ideals and fashion accessibility. She has about a million followers and she basically became popular for making videos where she would jiggle her body to music in her underwear and as a plus-size woman that’s something you rarely ever see. I learn so much from watching her Instagram stories alone.”Most likely, others feel the same way about Eggerue. The BBC recently included her on its annual 100 Women list, honouring trailblazers in their field. “I remember when I was laughed at for creating #saggyboobsmatter,” she wrote in an Instagram post announcing the news. “Now, I’m being referred to as a leader among legends!” A new breed of woke fashion influencer?

As a gay man of colour he didn’t fit the everyday indie rock frontman mould – he shattered it. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we look at his extraordinary influence. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyNobody could accuse Kele Okereke of standing still. Following the release of his acclaimed 2017 solo effort, Fatherland, he’s spent the second half of this year on a sold-out international tour with his band Bloc Party, who are revisiting their beginnings by performing their seminal debut album, Silent Alarm, in its entirety. Meanwhile, he’s somehow found time to co-compose the score for the highly anticipated new musical Leave to Remain, which opens at the Lyric Hammersmith in January, with songwriter Matt Jones.And while his professional life continues to metamorphosise, his personal life has also taken on a new dimension as he, along with his partner, welcomed a baby girl into their lives. They called her Savannah. When I interviewed Okereke for Attitude magazine last year, I reminded him that he’d once proclaimed that his solo album came about because all his bandmates wanted to stop and have babies, but he wanted to wait until he was 35.“Did I say that? Wow!” he said. “I’ve always wanted to be a father, but as a gay man I didn’t know if it was possible.”While being a gay parent in the UK these days isn’t exactly a revolutionary act, back in the mid-noughties a queer black singer fronting an indie rock band was nothing short of extraordinary. This was a scene dominated by straight white men where a certain type of swaggering masculinity was the default, yet here was a softly spoken, soulful gay man whose band was leading the race.Even though Okereke himself didn’t formally come out until his solo career took off, during Bloc Party’s reign his queerness was hiding in plain sight. He was never a flamboyant performer in the Freddie Mercury mould, and he didn’t openly embrace his sexuality the way a new generation of queer singers including Olly Alexander, Troye Sivan and Hayley Kiyoko would come to do. But his tender masculinity and softly coded lyrics spoke volumes.As a young, gay, indie music fan myself, who was many years away from landing the job of deputy editor of Attitude, I can attest to the importance of seeing someone like Okereke up on stage back then. And even though he might have been deliberately singing ambiguously, when Okereke launched into I Still Remember, from sophomore album A Weekend In The City, the queer intent was clear. The song is about two teenage lovers, both too afraid to make a move (“You should have asked me for itI would have been brave”). Here was someone who saw the world differently, here was someone like me.Fast forward 11 years and there’s nothing coded about Okereke now, or the songs he sings. On Fatherland he duets with Years \u0026amp Years’s Olly Alexander, on a track called Grounds for Resentment. “It’s the first time I’ve ever sung a romantic duet with another boy, and that’s important,” he says. “I feel, as a gay singer, you can fall into the trap of thinking we’re not really allowed to express desire. That as a gay man singing about love and desire, everything has to be coded.”That trap has opened wide now and Okereke can proudly count himself among a legion of queer musicians whose sexuality is everyday, yet still extraordinary.Okereke’s boundless musical curiosity has since seen him move into theatre as he scores a highly anticipated new play, out early 2019. Leave to Remain tells the story of a gay couple whose marriage forces two very different families to come together.While it’s clear that Okereke’s not short of projects to give his attention to, his primary focus for the foreseeable future is his own family. When I asked him if he has any doubts about raising his daughter as a gay parent he’s firm in his response: “We’re going to do all that we can to make sure she has the strength to stand in her own convictions,” he says. “That’s how I’ve lived my life. I’ve had to go out and be myself in spite of what everyone was telling me.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1aafbcc782d4d47654b9750cdd691f452f301c5/0_596_5268_3160/master/5268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf77ed7983b84a16d168f8e7d639925","title":"10 european art anniversaries in 2019 exhibitions bauhaus leonardo","story":"From 100 years of Bauhaus to 500 years since Leonardo’s death, a host of landmark art events and exhibitions open around Europe this yearIt is 350 years since the death of Rembrandt van Rijn.

Top marks! Two years ago, Lucy Worsley delivered unto us the three-part series British History’s Biggest Fibs. She took us through the spin Henry VIII put on the Wars of the Roses and how Shakespeare took it and ran with it, helping to preserve big H’s not entirely unbiased account of it as one of the most attractive pieces in the national reliquary. She pointed out that the bloodless Glorious Revolution wasn’t so bloodless or glorious if you happened to be walking as a Scotsman or Irishman through the tumultuous year of 1688. She also showed us how the new, modern, caring ‘n’ sharing form of imperialism that created the Raj with loving Empress Vicky as the gentle polisher of the jewel in her crown … umm … wasn’t.It was an opportune look, presented with customary brio by the historian, at the process of wish fulfilment, misdirection, confabulation and copper-bottomed lying that makes up an unknowable proportion of all the “facts” we think we have about the past and how it unfolded. Now – because, let’s face it, the time for programmes problematising national narratives and interrogating how they are wrought ain’t got any less ripe over the last 24 months – it is the turn of the United States.In a move that will probably put her among the first up against the wall when Trump eventually finds the right combination of concrete slabs, metal slats and funding to build it, the first episode of American History’s Biggest Fibs investigated the traditional story Americans tell themselves about plucky colonial farmers unhooking George III’s greedy little tax fingers that were squeezing the life out of a land that yearned to be free in the American Revolution.The standard version pitches it as a David and Goliath battle. Said plucky colonial farmers, armed with a musket apiece, set their faces against the professional British army and, with a little help from Paul Revere, General George Washington, God and Molly Pitcher, conquered it and brought about life, liberty (bells) and the pursuit of happiness for all, with a little time for high jinks in Boston Harbour along the way.Unless you are currently wearing full Maga regalia beneath your Klan outfit, you will already know this is not quite how it went down. But Worsley drilled yet deeper, dispelling myths as she showed how they were constructed out of political and emotional needs, enshrined in art and perpetuated by both. E pluribus version of events, unum foundation story.So Revere didn’t make his ride from Lexington to Concord alone, but had two companions. In fact he didn’t make it to Concord – one of the others did. But Henry Wadsworth Longfellow made him a lone (and successful) hero in his poem a century later and that’s the story that stuck. Similarly, there is no evidence the liberty bell rang out to summon Philadelphians to the town hall for the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence, but novelist George Lippard published a story in 1841 in which it did and so it has rung ever since. Molly Pitcher comes into being 50 years after she supposedly took up her husband’s sword on the battlefield, fragments of anecdote and memory gathered and embodied in one figure as witnesses passed away.The Boston Tea Party was no picnic either, but part of several years’ violent struggle between colonial and British troops, with the perpetrators being condemned as criminals rather than hailed as hilarious pranksters.Less whimsically and rather more of a factor in the construction of the American psyche and identity, the plucky farmers did not overwhelm the superior force with determination, grit and small arms. They allied with Britain’s great enemy, the French. Yes, dear GOPers – cheese-eating surrender monkeys helped George Washington to victory at Yorktown.This is but to scratch the surface of all the information contained within the hour, for Worsley always puts together a dense package.

This will be returned once the refurbishment is complete.But buyers won’t be disappointed, according to Cacioppo.“Sambuca is known as the ‘city of splendor’,” he added. “This fertile patch of land is dubbed the ‘earthly paradise’. We’re located inside a nature reserve, packed with history. Gorgeous beaches, woods and mountains surround us. It’s silent and peaceful, an idyllic retreat for a detox stay.”With the population dwindling, Cacioppo said the town needs outsiders to prevent it from going under.“We can’t afford to lose our lovely Arab heritage.

His work has since been seen as a gold standard for news journalism.But in an interview, Galtung said his definitions were intended to show how news was getting it wrong. He stressed that his paper said that if news continued to reflect the world in this antagonistic way, it would generate extreme negativity, and “a growing tension between the centre and the periphery both nationally and globally”.“It’s a complete misunderstanding,” he said from his home in southern Spain. “Our work from the early 1960s was meant to be a warning of the consequences for the way news media filtered the world. But the western news industry believed I was describing how things should be done, instead of what is being done.“I was saying, ‘what you do is incomplete. You are missing a major part of the image of the world,’” said Galtung, who will address the annual Constructive Journalism Conference in Geneva on 18 January.But, he said, editors and journalists, particularly in the US, interpreted the work as “the standard on which generation after generation ever after has filtered the world to the public through the news”.The overwhelming negativity of news in recent years has prompted a debate about its impact on the public psyche. Recent academic studies have found that pessimistic news makes audiences feel helpless and less likely to engage in solving global problems.“News media are now so full of stories on misery,” said Hans Henrik Knoop, an assistant professor at Denmark’s Institute of Psychology. “Negativity controls news flow, and therefore also politics and public debate. Apathy or fear is the result. The risk is that people not only deselect media as sources for news, but also that they disengage in the public debate.”Galtung predicted as much in 1965. The article “The structure of foreign news” was published in March of that year in the Journal of Peace Research by Galtung and colleague Mari Holmboe Ruge. The pair examined the coverage of international conflicts in four Norwegian newspapers and listed 12 criteria, which seemed to be present in order for an event to be considered newsworthy. One of the most dominant was “reference to something negative”.To this day Wikipedia cites the article from Galtung and Ruge as the basis for how the news is constructed.As Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University stated in 2013: “The most cited work on news value has been that of Galtung and Ruge … Most of the research since the 1960s ... has used Galtung and Ruge as the starting point.” The academics’ findings are taught in school and journalism colleges across the world.The academic paper concluded with a warning on the consequences for society if news organisations continued to promote confrontation, tension and sensation over collaboration, resolution and compassion.“The consequence of all this is an image of the world that gives little autonomy to the periphery but sees it as mainly existing for the sake of the centre,” the paper said. “Conflict will be emphasised, conciliation not.”“And this is exactly what has happened,” Galtung said. “News media give a total biased picture of reality. The perception of reality in the public becomes overly negative.”For years, the founder of peace and conflict studies and head of the Peace Research Institute at the University of Oslo has been reluctant to speak to journalists, as he feels misrepresented by the news industry.He is unequivocal on the consequences of the news media’s misreading of his research. “It is enormous. Absolutely enormous,” he said.“It shapes what people are doing. And it shapes politicians, it makes them negative, instead of putting emphasis on the good in society they want to construct. They become unnecessarily competitive instead of being cooperative.”Ulrik Haagerup is former executive director of news at Danish Public Broadcasting and founder and CEO of Constructive Institute located at Aarhus University in Denmark.

It is his first visit since last June when he arrived before a landmark meeting between Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore. Efforts made since then to get Pyongyang to denuclearise appear to have stalled.Hours before Kim Yong-chol’s arrival, Trump – who declared the day after the 12 June Singapore summit that the nuclear threat posed by North Korea was over – unveiled a revamped US missile defence strategy that singled out the country as an ongoing and “extraordinary threat”.Kim, a hardline former spy chief, was due to meet Pompeo on Friday, when he could also go to see Trump at the White House, a person familiar with the matter said.The visit is a sign of potential movement in a diplomatic process that has struggled for months and, according to the source, could yield an announcement of plans for another summit.However, there has been no indication of any narrowing of differences over US demands that North Korea abandon a nuclear weapons programme that threatens the US or over Pyongyang’s demand for a lifting of punishing sanctions.Pompeo had planned to meet Kim Yong-chol to discuss a second summit last November, but the meeting was postponed at the last moment. Kim Jong-un said in a new year speech he was willing to meet Trump “at any time”. On his last visit to Washington, Kim Yong-chol delivered a letter from Kim Jong-un to Trump that opened the way for the summit in Singapore.That meeting yielded a vague pledge from the North Korean leader to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, which led Trump to declare that there was “no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea”.Despite the lack of tangible progress since, Trump has been keen to hold another summit.CNN quoted a source familiar with the US-North Korea talks as saying that Kim Yong-chol would be carrying a new letter for Trump.US-based analysts said it was likely the North Koreans would be seeking a clearer message from the Trump administration on any concessions it might be willing to make.“The North Koreans need a real indication of what the US is willing to put on the table,” said Jenny Town, a North Korea expert at 38 North, a Washington-based thinktank.The South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, said on Wednesday that if North Korea took concrete steps toward abandoning its weapons programmes, Washington could offer a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, humanitarian aid or a permanent channel for bilateral dialogue.Victor Cha, a former White House adviser on Asia under President George W Bush, suggested Trump may be so desperate for a policy “win” that he could be vulnerable to a bad deal with North Korea.“I worry that the timing works to North Korea’s benefit,” Cha said, citing pressures on Trump such as the partial US government shutdown and the ongoing investigation into alleged Russian ties to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.Earlier this month, Trump defended the stuttering progress on North Korea by saying that Pyongyang had stopped missile and bomb testing and if it had not been for his administration “you’d be having a nice big fat war in Asia”.Communist-ruled Vietnam, which has good relations with both the US and North Korea, has been widely touted as the most likely venue for a second Trump-Kim summit."},{"url":null,"title":"vote dildo for indonesia rivals for president find young voters hard to please","story":"As elections loom, millennials tired of leaders who do not represent them find happiness in spoof social media personalities With their moustaches, traditional headwear and big campaign promises, Nurhadi and Aldo resemble almost any other politician. But, as Indonesia heads towards a presidential election, looks can be deceiving.The two presidential candidates are in fact fictional.Created by a group of disaffected millennials, they have struck a chord with young voters and their social media profiles, which regularly lampoon mainstream politics, have attracted almost 400,000 followers on Instagram and thousands on Twitter and Facebook since their creation last month.In what has so far shaped up to be a lacklustre election campaign, Nurhadi and Aldo have become best known for their vulgar campaign tagline, a creative abbreviation of the last few letters of their names to make “Dildo for Indonesia”.“I see this movement as a breath of fresh air for our politics,” says Edwin, one of the creators, told the . “It is a new perspective, a new way to enjoy politics, and the drama of elite politicians who always argue, but don’t actually represent us.“I was really looking forward to hearing from our candidates, but mostly they don’t show us their programs, or generate solutions for our problems.”The world’s third-largest democracy heads to the polls in April, and millennials will account for 80 out of 187 million voters, but some young voters are not enthused about the choices in front of them.On Thursday night in the first of five presidential debates – focused on law, human rights, terrorism and corruption – neither candidate veered much off script, with analysts suggesting they failed to articulate creative visions for some of Indonesia’s most deep-rooted problems.President Joko Widodo’s controversial pick for running mate, 75-year-old Islamic cleric Ma’ruf Amin who has advocated support for fatwas against religious minorities, LGBT people and even yoga, barely managed a few words, although when he did he made them count, saying “terrorism is not jihad”.His rival, the former military general Prabowo Subianto, avoided talk of past human rights violations, of which he stands accused, arguing the wages of civil servants should be increased to discourage corruption.The Nurhadi and Aldo accounts appropriate the classic Indonesian campaign aesthetic, a pious-looking candidate pictured next to their ballot number, or a lofty social program, often abbreviated into a catchy acronym.They mock the political formula, often using vulgarity. One policy for an internet subsidy program, “Program Subsidi Tagihan Warnet Bagi Umum” is cut into “Prostat Bau”, meaning “smelly prostate”.Others posts mock the conflict of interest between Indonesian media ownership and political parties, or use a caricature of Karl Marx, a satirical stab at Indonesia’s paranoia of communism, which is banned.Nurhadi and Aldo are also pro LGBT rights and have a “halal” program to legalise marijuana – both unthinkable in Indonesia’s current political climate.Edwin, who is a college student from central Java and asked that the  use his first name only, said he created the candidates with the help of seven other young people he met through an online comedy page after becoming fed up with this year’s presidential candidates.A masseur from the Javanese town of Kudus agreed to lend his face to the campaign as Nurhadi, while Aldo is pure fiction, a mash-up of two different faces.This year’s presidential election pits controversial and retired Army general Prabowo Subianto and his running mate, former investment banker and businessman Sandiaga Uno against the incumbent president, Joko Widodo and his running mate, Ma’ruf Amin. The president’s running mate is a 75-year-old Islamic cleric notorious for promoting fatwas against LGBT people, religious minorities and yoga.Pangeran Siahaan, the founder of Asumsi, a YouTube channel that includes a weekly political talk show, says that after Amin’s candidacy was announced some young voters started to consider abstaining from the vote. He says: “I think Dildo For Indonesia, that counter movement, was started because there is some part of the young generation that are not really satisfied.”“I think both candidates are trapped in what I call ‘viral and meme politics’ because they want to be viral and well distributed on social media because they think that is where millennials read their content,” explains Pangeran, “But if you take a look deeper, it is nothing but cosmetic.”Wearing sneakers or including a pop culture reference in a political speech, he adds, hasn’t worked for them either because: “The millennials don’t buy it.”Behind the dirty references masked as political visions, Edwin says their satirical account has a serious agenda.By showing how easy it is to replicate a vacuous political campaign he hopes voters will think twice about their choices. “We are here to provide humour but also education about how to choose a great leader and be a critical thinker,” he says, “So Nurhadi-Aldo are doing something other candidates are not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b995a8405c7fcb69364f310a31edf04dcff70df4/3_126_3628_2176/master/3628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b5e2b2f12bf359e642874d621d093e6","title":"indias kumbh mela festival in pictures","story":"Thought to be the world’s largest human gathering, more than 20 million Hindu pilgrims ritually bathed on the opening day of the festival"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"The first significant career choice you make will not necessarily be life-determiningRegister your details now \u0026ndash you can determine your final course preferences laterMany students receive financial help but preparation is key when it comes to securing the correct level of fundingAvoid the traps: Parents can offer vital support, but their knowledge is often outdatedWhat factors should you consider when deciding on what career path you wish to takeMultinational firms concerned over standard of foreign languages among school-leaversWe talk to graduates who made the wrong call when they filled out the CAO formTimeline for the 2019 college application processThousands to apply for courses ahead of this month\u0026rsquos application deadlineDownload PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Suspect released and file to be sent to DPP in connection with December 9th incidentJanuary 21st, 1919 was first day of the War of Independence and the meeting of first D\u0026aacuteilGarda\u0026iacute examining possible drugs motive for double shooting that left second man seriously injured in SwordsBradford feels forgotten by rest of Britain and now sees Brexit as an elitist thingTwo TDs tell D\u0026aacuteil a woman was denied abortion \u0026lsquodespite consultants\u0026rsquo approval\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoIt was accidental and should not have happened,\u0026rsquo says Seumas Robinson\u0026rsquos daughterGarda\u0026iacute made 445 arrests on suspicion of intoxicated driving over New Year periodAfter rejecting Government proposals on pay, Nurses to go on strike later this month\u0026lsquoThis is not what the people of Ireland voted for.

The man who led the operation was SeumAs Robinson. Here his daughter speaks for the first time.Now 85, Dimphne Brennan, in her own words, has disliked few people in her life. However, she makes an exception for Dan Breen, the man linked most frequently to the Soloheadbeg ambush a century ago this weekend.“I have quite a degree of contempt for the way he has lied all the time about what went on then. He deliberately set out to do his best to make my father look bad. He didn’t care about how many lies he told,” she declares.Breen and Seán Treacy are most famous for the ambush in Tipperary on January 21st, 1919, when two Irish Catholic Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) constables were shot dead as they escorted gelignite to a local quarry.However, they did not lead the Soloheadbeg attack, which was not authorised by the First Dáil, but which is regarded as the opening shots of the War of Independence.Instead, it was led by Dimphne Brennan’s father, Seumas Robinson, a native of Belfast, who had been elected by the members of the Third Tipperary Brigade to take command in October 1918.So prominent are Breen and Treacy in the iconography of Irish republican history that many are surprised to find out that they were not the ones in charge at Soloheadbeg.It did not stop Breen arguing that planning for Soloheadbeg had little to do with Robinson. Robinson had been a “yes man” and a “stooge”. His presence at Soloheadbeg was “accidental”.Breen’s words rankle with Robinson’s daughter to this day. Now 85, she is the last surviving of Robinson’s seven children and has never before spoken in public about her father.The man she knows as “Daddy” died in 1961 at the age of 72. He had been a TD and senator in the Free State and later set up the Bureau of Military History to record the memoirs of those who had been active in the revolutionary period.The enmity shown to her father by some in Tipperary was down to his outsider status. Robinson was born into a republican family. His grandfather fled to France after the 1848 rebellion and his father and mother were both born in that country. They returned to Ireland.Robinson joined the IRB in Glasgow and took part in the Easter Rising. He was sent to Tipperary to organise a group of men who were enthusiastic but not experienced in the ways of warfare.“They were misbehaving and not doing things properly,” Mrs Brennan believes, “He was to go down and try to put some discipline on them so he was unpopular from the start.”Her father, she argues, was a moral man – a trait stemming from his early days in a seminary in Scotland where he trained to be a monk. He left in 1913 intent on being an Irish revolutionary.“He was the gentlest, kindest person you could ever meet. He never raised a hand to anyone of us ever. He was nothing but good. There was nothing judgmental about him. He was a moral man.”Questioned about her father’s involvement in the War of Independence, she replies: “I often thought about it and at some stage did think about how you can kill people that you don’t even know.“I don’t know how I would behave if I was back then.“Looking back with a moral judgment on it, you’d say, ‘Ooh, did they do that?’ But if you are in the midst of it, it is different.“He was intellectually, morally and religiously convinced he was doing the right thing. He must have had a ferociously stubborn gene as well,” she told The .Later, he insisted that the gelignite seizure was legitimate and that the constables, James McDonnell and Patrick O’Connell had been killed when they refused to surrender and tried to fire back.Robinson’s evidence is directly contradicted by Breen, who baldly stated that the aim was to “kill someone and we wanted to start a war”. Such a claim is an affront to her father’s memory, she insists.“Daddy thought that was a bloody awful reason for doing it,” says Mrs Brennan, “I have heard my father say it so often from his mouth. It was accidental and should not have happened. There was never intention of killing them.”Mrs Brennan will attend this Sunday’s Soloheadbeg centenary commemoration, where she will meet some of the relatives of the two constables. “Boy, do I think that’s right that they will be there,” she said.Robinson was also involved in an incident at Knocklong in May 1919 in which members of the Third Tipperary Brigade rescued their comrade Séan Hogan from a train. Hogan had been arrested the previous evening and was being taken by armed guard to Cork Barracks for questioning over the Soloheadbeg incident. Two RIC officers escorting Hogan were shot dead in the ensuing gun battle.Hogan fell on hard times afterwards , setting up a vegetable farm in Dublin which failed. He ended up living in Robinson’s house for two years: “He had nowhere else to go.“He never got over what happened. His nerves were shattered. We were all just kids and we didn’t disturb him in his room. He didn’t talk to us,” recalled Mrs BrennanHowever, her father lived his later life with serenity: “My father was comfortable with himself that it had to be done and he did it. The biggest thing about him is that he went back into the monastery in his head.“He retreated back into that and that is why he was such a kind and gentle man. You wouldn’t have been able to place that man as the military man that he was,” she remembers.Next Monday, January 21st, is the 100th anniversary of two defining events. That day in 1919, the first shots were fired in the War of Independence when two policemen were killed in an ambush at Soloheadbeg in Co Tipperary. In Dublin, meanwhile, Dáil Éireann met for the first time. Gathered in the Mansion House for a meeting that drew worldwide attention, members made a declaration of independence and adopted the Democratic Programme, a radical agenda for the republic.On Monday, The  will publish “1919 – War and Peace”, a 48-page supplement covering the events of that year at home and abroad. From political manoeuvrings in Dublin and London to the aftermath of the first World War, and from the Amritsar massacre in India to the Paris Peace Conference, it covers all the major themes of the period, with special study guides for junior and senior cycle students.Among the pledges contained in the Democratic Programme adopted by the first Dáil was that the Irish republic would be judged by its ability to offer dignity and security for its children. On Saturday, The  will launch “No Child 2020”, a nine-month project that looks at how that ambition can be fulfilled 100 years on.A commemoration of the decade of revolution 1912-1923.

Photograph:  Jack TaylorGetty ImagesJeremy Corbyn could face up to a dozen resignations from the Labour frontbench if the party backs a second referendum as a way out of the Brexit crisis.A string of junior shadow ministers have told the  they are strongly opposed to the idea of a second referendum, which they fear would expose Labour to a vicious backlash in leave-voting constituencies.The development follows another tense day of brinkmanship in Westminster between Theresa May and the Labour leader as they seek a way out of the crisis that has engulfed both major parties.Mr Corbyn refused to enter talks with Theresa May on Thursday until she rules out the idea of a no-deal departure and demanded that his party’s MPs refuse similar invitations. Later Mrs May wrote to Mr Corbyn telling him that ruling out no-deal was “an impossible condition” and calling on him to join cross-party discussions.With no sign of the impasse being broken, pressure is growing on Labour to consider a so-called people’s vote as the UK prepares to leave the EU on March 29th.With Mr Corbyn’s hopes of a general election fading with the prime minister’s narrow victory in the no-confidence vote, some Labour supporters are raising pressure on Mr Corbyn to support a second referendum.A snap poll conducted after the crushing defeat of Mrs May’s Brexit plan has found a 12-point lead for remaining in the EU – the largest margin since the 2016 vote.But several senior shadow ministers from constituencies that voted to leave the EU say they would consider their positions if Mr Corbyn concedes to pressure to back a second referendum.One said: “I would be in a really difficult position if we backed a second referendum. I would have little choice but to stand down if I was to have any hope of retaining my seat and representing my constituents.”Another said they had made their views clear to Mr Corbyn’s office and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. “I would feel deeply uncomfortable about going into a people’s vote at this stage. Given all the commitments that we made in the general election, we have to carry them out. This concept of blocking Brexit is wrong and would break a link with millions of our traditional voters who expect us to keep our word,” the shadow minister said.Anti-Brexit campaign group Labour for a People’s Vote published a list of 71 Labour MPs who support its cause on Wednesday, and claimed many more were privately supportive.But backbench MPs who have been canvassing opinion claim that number is matched by vehement opponents of a referendum, some of whom would be prepared to break the whip rather than support it.Several shadow cabinet ministers, including the Labour chair, Ian Lavery, and the shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, are also sceptical, believing the party’s first priority must be to keep up the pressure for a general election.Lavery made a passionate intervention against a new referendum at last week’s shadow cabinet meeting. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite trade union, has also said it would be a “betrayal” to seek to reverse the 2016 result.Gloria De Piero, the shadow women’s minister, told the  she was not in favour of a second referendum. “I stood on a manifesto that promised to respect the referendum result,” she said.Other shadow cabinet ministers, including the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, are more sympathetic towards a second referendum.Labour strategists have not ruled out a free vote on a second referendum, believing that whipping MPs either to support or oppose a referendum would open a deep rift.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said that with no agreed Brexit deal in place, it was unclear what options would be offered on a second referendum – and referendums were the wrong way to resolve the complex situation.“I think they’re terrible ways to make rational decisions,” she said. “And there’s a swathe of the public who would never forgive us.”At a meeting in Hastings, East Sussex, Mr Corbyn remained uncommitted on the idea of a second referendum, saying again that it remained one of several options if an election did not happen.Explaining why he was the only opposition leader not to meet Mrs May for one-to-one talks, Mr Corbyn dismissed the cross-party discussions as a “stunt”, adding that Mrs May appeared unable to grasp the fact that her withdrawal agreement was now “dead”.“She seems to be prepared to send the country hurtling towards a cliff-edge,” he said.But Labour’s former prime minister Tony Blair said Mr Corbyn was wrong to refuse to meet Mrs May.“If, in a moment of national crisis, the prime minister asks the leader of the opposition to come and talk, of course he should,” Blair told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Another former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, called for the Brexit deadline to be extended by a year, as he said the country was now “more ided” than at the time of Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax.MPs should force the government to extend article 50 and then give the public the final say on a renegotiated Brexit deal, he said.Speaking in Edinburgh on Thursday evening, Mr Brown condemned the “paralysed and immobilised” parliament in Westminster and said there was rising anger from the public who wanted to be involved in the decision-making process.In a further development, a poll conducted by YouGov of more than 1,000 voters on Wednesday found 56 per cent would now vote to stay in the EU, against 44 per cent who want to leave.Exactly the same proportion of voters said they wanted a second EU referendum - three points higher than recorded in a similar poll before Christmas. Backing for a so-called people’s vote among Labour supporters stood at 78 per cent.The remain lead was extended further when respondents were asked to compare it to Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement or the option of leaving the EU without a deal.Against the prime minister’s deal, remain led by 65 per cent to 35 per cent, while against no-deal was 59 per cent to 41 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyPrince Philip crash: Duke \u0026#39asked if everyone else was alright\u0026#39 after car \u0026#39tumbled\u0026#39 across road leaving him bleeding Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson to make major speech as Theresa May battles to come up with Plan BIsil Beatles: Government right not to block death penalty, High Court rulesPrince Philip will accept he can no longer drive while \u0026#39muttering under his breath\u0026#39, says friend Gyles BrandrethThe Last Survivors: children of the Holocaust tell their stories in landmark BBC filmWho might replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

After levelling the land, acquiring superior seeds and changing planting techniques from a scattering style known as broadcasting to transplanting nursery-grown crops in neat rows, his output has increased by more than 50 per cent.“I’ve realised rice farming is a business,” he says.Rice is a staple food in Africa but supply falls far short of demand with yields in the sub-Saharan region among the lowest in the world. Pressure is mounting on local agriculture to feed rapidly growing populations and reduce reliance on expensive foreign rice.A worker at Labana rice millsIn Nigeria, the continent’s most populous country, productivity has increased but 55 per cent of demand is still met by imports. Government efforts to reach self-sufficiency and improve food security are contingent on the success of small-scale farmers like Sani, who account for more than 80 per cent of cultivation.But slow mechanisation, insufficient yields and poor quality rice – compounded by a weak market infrastructure – have left them unable to compete with consumer preferences for imported varieties.In the past, you risked “losing a tooth” on the stones in Nigerian rice but there’s a growing awareness that now it matches up to imported brands says Abubakar Abba Adamu, CEO of Labana, one of the largest rice mills in north-west Nigeria.Labana provides training and high quality seeds to thousands of farmers in Kebbi State then guarantees purchase of their harvest under the Competitive African Rice Initiative (CARI), a project that supports value chains in African rice farming.Farmers plant rice in rows using rope to space the seedlings“The mills feel their investment in rice is protected and farmers know they have a market,” explains Dr Kristina Spantig, project manager at CARI, which is implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, the German development agency.More than 90,000 Nigerian farmers have entered into contracts since 2013 and 81,165 have attended CARI’s Farmer Business School, learning to fill in cropping calendars, space seedlings with rope and irrigate fields during wet and dry seasons.Agents visit the fields with agriculture apps like RiceAdvice and WeedManager, which calculate fertiliser quantities and identify types of weed. At harvest time, farmers beat grain from the husks on metal drums to minimise breakage.“They are more and more ambitious,” says Adegoke Kazeem Adeniyi, CARI coordinator and value chain advisor at GIZ. The price of local rice is rising as the quality improves. “It’s no longer more attractive to buy imported rice,” he adds.  Rice farmer Umar Abu Bakr uses a portable pump to manage the water levels in his paddy fields in KebbiIn Suru Village, where residents are mainly farmers, Umar Abu Bakr has enrolled his daughters in school, finished the frontage of his house and fulfilled his religious obligations as a Muslim by going on the haj.Before he only produced enough rice for domestic use these days he has “peace of mind”, he says.  Since switching to transplanting he has upped his yield from around 30 bags of paddy (unmilled rice) to 75 per hectare.“I didn’t think it would work at first but then I saw the benefit.” Using a portable pump he lowers the water level in one of his fields. It makes the crops think they are dying and boosts growth, he explains.Most of the farmers in this community have shifted their focus to rice. Outside the heaving village grain store, new motorbikes are clustered beneath a tree. Young people are buying more as the wealth of the whole community increases, Abu Bakr says.Women dry parboiled rice in the sunMarket day here is the busiest in Kebbi State as trucks squeeze by to load up on fresh paddy for the mills, which supply wholesalers in the city of Lagos. Others come with camels or bikes to transport single sacks for local buyers.Just 20 minutes away in Jega Village, a group of women sieve and toss pots of paddy in the shade of a tree. This way of cleaning and preparing the grains is generations-old but a few simple adjustments have refined the process and reduced the time it takes from 24 hours to 14.“The new technology is easier for us,” says overseer Hadiza Adamo, 50. The paddy is washed several times then steamed rather than boiled, resulting in cleaner, tastier rice that fetches a higher price at market, earning the women up to 2,000 (£4.30) Naira profit per bag compared to less than 700₦ before.These days they don’t need to ferry the bags to market. “Now customers come to us,” Adamo says. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson to make major speech as Theresa May battles to come up with Plan BPrince Philip will accept he can no longer drive while \u0026#39muttering under his breath\u0026#39, says friend Gyles BrandrethThe Last Survivors: children of the Holocaust tell their stories in landmark BBC filmPrince Philip crash: Duke \u0026#39asked if everyone else was alright\u0026#39 after car \u0026#39tumbled\u0026#39 across road leaving him bleeding Who might replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

More than 500 journalists were in attendance to watch US president Donald Trump booed for repeating his familiar criticisms of the press while former British prime minister David Cameron made headlines after being buttonholed by a reporter into arguing Brexit “isn’t a disaster”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhat is the WEF?The WEF defines itself as “committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic\u0026nbspand other leaders of society to shape global, regional\u0026nbspand industry agendas”.In addition to providing a space for the exchange of ideas and policy proposals, Davos has also\u0026nbspserved as a platform from which world leaders can resolve their differences.Most famously,\u0026nbspNelson Mandela and\u0026nbspFW de Klerk, South Africa\u0027s last white minority leader,\u0026nbspshook hands on the future of their country\u0026nbspat the summit in 1992. Two years later,\u0026nbspIsraeli foreign minister Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,\u0026nbspreached key draft agreements on the disputed territories of Gaza and Jericho.It has also seen controversy.Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan stormed out of a session in 2009 after arguing with Mr Peres who had subsequently become Israel\u0027s prime minister, North Korea’s invitation\u0026nbspwas revoked in 2016 over sanction-defying nuclear tests while Chinese premier Xi Jinping used a speech in 2017 to stand up for the international establishment after populist uprisings had led the Leave campaign to win the Brexit referendum and seen President Trump enter the White House.Among the many notable celebrities to have addressed the WEF is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a passionate environmentalist, who spoke at\u0026nbspthe forum’s gathering in 2016\u0026nbspon climate change, pledging a $15m (£11.6m) donation on behalf of his foundation. A commendable effort undermined somewhat when he was ridiculed four months later for using a private jet to fly from France to New York to accept an award bestowed by a clean water group.The WEF has faced criticism in the past, with its meetings picketed by anti-globalisation protesters who believe organisations like the forum, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation,\u0026nbspexacerbate poverty and environmental destruction by promoting corporate interests and profit-driven business practices over humanitarian concerns.Davos, they argue, amounts to little more than the Champions League of networking events for Fat Cats.The Transnational Institute, a Dutch non-profit think tank, has gone further, attacking “the Davos class” and suggesting the WEF’s purpose is\u0026nbsp“to function as a socialising institution for the emerging global elite, globaliation’s \u0027Mafiocracy\u0027\u0026nbspof bankers, industrialists, oligarchs, technocrats and politicians. They promote common ideas, and serve common interests: their own”.What is the theme of this year’s summit?The WEF is again placing a green agenda at the centre of\u0026nbspits 2019 summit, whose theme is: “Globalisation 4.0: Shaping a New Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.”The collective recently issued\u0026nbspa report warning the international community’s ability to combat pollution has plummeted to “crisis levels” as a result of political and economic tensions, citing the US-China trade war as a particularly threatening development.“With global trade and economic growth at risk in 2019, there is a more urgent need than ever to renew the architecture of international cooperation,” said WEF president Borge Brende.“We simply do not have the gunpowder to deal with the kind of slowdown that current dynamics might lead us towards.“What we need now is coordinated, concerted action to sustain growth and to tackle the grave threats facing our world today.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Three people have been injured in a massive explosion on the roof of a La Doua university building in Lyon, FranceSri Lanka\u0027s Special Task Force members perform during their passing out parade in KalutaraCars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

This includes ensuring the accuracy of official statistics. But despite these responsibilities, the Authority has refused repeatedly to correct the problem,” the committee said.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSince 2010, when there was a change in the way clothing prices were averaged, there has been an 0.8 per cent gap, on average, between the annual rate of RPI inflation and the growth of the Consumer Price Index, up from 0.5\u0026nbspper cent previously.\u0026nbspThe majority of experts agree that the RPI is upwardly biased.UK inflation hits two-year low as petrol prices fallThe UK Statistics Authority, which was formed in 2008, says the reason it has not ordered the Office for National Statistics, which it oversees, to reform the way it calculates RPI is because this would impact many UK Government bond holders, whose payments are linked to RPI, and any reform would require the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The chair of the Authority, Sir David Norgrove,\u0026nbspinformed the committee\u0026nbspin his testimony\u0026nbspthat there was no point doing so because he expected the Chancellor would simply refuse and that it would be a more productive use of his time to put pressure on ministers to stop using the RPI for regulated prices and to use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) instead.But the committee, which includes two former Chancellors and senior Treasury officials, said this stance was “untenable”.“Rather than pre-empting the decision of the Chancellor, it should fulfil its statutory duty to promote and safeguard the quality of official statistics and to do that, it should request a fix to the clothing problem,” it said.“The Chancellor should approve this change regardless of the effects on index-linked gilt holders, holders of which before 2010 received an unwarranted windfall.”The RPI’s status as a “national statistic” was revoked in 2013, but the ONS continues to compile it because it is required to do so by legislation. The index is used as a benchmark for £435bn of inflation-linked government bonds.It is also used in the calculation of student loan interest and increased in train fares.The problem in the RPI relates to a flawed formula and its interaction with a change in the collection of the prices of women’s tops.It has been estimated that around £1bn a year in excess interest is paid to bond investors by taxpayers due to the 2010 RPI change.But in other areas the Government has been accused of “inflation shopping” for its own benefit.The chairman of the Lords committee, Michael Forsyth, said: “When the government gives money to people it is generally opting to adjust payments for inflation using the CPI. But when it takes money from people, it is generally opting to use the RPI, which has been around 1 per cent\u0026nbsphigher than CPI in recent years. This simply is not fair.”In response to the Lords committee’s report, the UK Statistics Authority said it agreed that the RPI had “significant shortcomings” and it would “continue to work closely with our counterparts in government and at the Bank of England and respond to the committee”.The most recent data shows CPI inflation at 2.1\u0026nbspper cent in December 2018 and RPI inflation at 2.7 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The streaming service almost doubled operating profit in the fourth quarter - it rose from $245m (£189m) in the last three months of 2017 to $447m - and revenue grew to $3.7bn from $3.3bn. In spite of the strong numbers, the company’s stock tumbled almost 4 per cent in after-hours trading. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAnalysts offered a few reasons for the share price decline, including the fact that revenue narrowly missed expectations. Meanwhile, although Netflix reported annual profit of $1.6bn, the company spent $13bn on ramping up production of original content such as Bird Box and Roma. Netflix responds to criticism for using disaster footage in Bird BoxNetflix reveals huge viewing figures for You and Sex EducationSteve Carell to star in Netflix comedy inspired by Trump\u0027s Space ForceNetflix to raise prices for 58 million subscribers across USThe company also recently announced that it would raise subscription prices for its 58 million US users, the first price hike since 2017. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was notable that Netflix is “now confident enough to use price increases to slash its cash flow deficit even faster”.“You can only squeeze customers so far, but we think there’s a way to go before the pips squeak. The average customer spends around 10 hours a week on the service, which works out at around 25 cents an hour. Hard to argue that isn’t value for money,” he added.“The worry, of course, is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren’t going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard. The battle for viewers’ eyeballs is only just getting started.”Analysts also pointed out that Thursday’s share price movement should be taken in the context of 50 per cent stock growth since Christmas Eve. “The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said Paul Verna, media analyst at eMarketer. “The bottom line is that Netflix remains the uncontested leader in the subscription video space.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two years later,\u0026nbspIsraeli foreign minister Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,\u0026nbspreached key draft agreements on the disputed territories of Gaza and Jericho.It has also seen controversy.Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan stormed out of a session in 2009 after arguing with Mr Peres who had subsequently become Israel\u0027s prime minister, North Korea’s invitation\u0026nbspwas revoked in 2016 over sanction-defying nuclear tests while Chinese premier Xi Jinping used a speech in 2017 to stand up for the international establishment after populist uprisings had led the Leave campaign to win the Brexit referendum and seen President Trump enter the White House.Among the many notable celebrities to have addressed the WEF is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a passionate environmentalist, who spoke at\u0026nbspthe forum’s gathering in 2016\u0026nbspon climate change, pledging a $15m (£11.6m) donation on behalf of his foundation. A commendable effort undermined somewhat when he was ridiculed four months later for using a private jet to fly from France to New York to accept an award bestowed by a clean water group.The WEF has faced criticism in the past, with its meetings picketed by anti-globalisation protesters who believe organisations like the forum, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation,\u0026nbspexacerbate poverty and environmental destruction by promoting corporate interests and profit-driven business practices over humanitarian concerns.Davos, they argue, amounts to little more than the Champions League of networking events for Fat Cats.The Transnational Institute, a Dutch non-profit think tank, has gone further, attacking “the Davos class” and suggesting the WEF’s purpose is\u0026nbsp“to function as a socialising institution for the emerging global elite, globaliation’s \u0027Mafiocracy\u0027\u0026nbspof bankers, industrialists, oligarchs, technocrats and politicians. They promote common ideas, and serve common interests: their own”.What is the theme of this year’s summit?The WEF is again placing a green agenda at the centre of\u0026nbspits 2019 summit, whose theme is: “Globalisation 4.0: Shaping a New Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.”The collective recently issued\u0026nbspa report warning the international community’s ability to combat pollution has plummeted to “crisis levels” as a result of political and economic tensions, citing the US-China trade war as a particularly threatening development.“With global trade and economic growth at risk in 2019, there is a more urgent need than ever to renew the architecture of international cooperation,” said WEF president Borge Brende.“We simply do not have the gunpowder to deal with the kind of slowdown that current dynamics might lead us towards.“What we need now is coordinated, concerted action to sustain growth and to tackle the grave threats facing our world today.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Three people have been injured in a massive explosion on the roof of a La Doua university building in Lyon, FranceSri Lanka\u0027s Special Task Force members perform during their passing out parade in KalutaraCars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

Last year, 25 students received offers from Oxford and Cambridge but this year\u0027s 41 offers sets a new record for the state school.Eight schools send more to Oxbridge than three quarters of the restLydia Khechine, who arrived in the UK alone when she was 12 after fleeing Algeria, is one of the students to receive an Oxbridge offer.The 18-year-old was unable to speak English when she first came to the country – now she has an offer to study History and Politics at Oxford University.She told the BBC: A lot of people filter themselves out of the Oxbridge process because they don\u0027t think they belong.But the truth is people from unconventional backgrounds like mine do have the potential and it\u0027s about reassuring ourselves that we have a voice.Sam Dobin, the director of sixth form at Brampton Manor, said: “Every student here goes to university. We have a very traditional approach with no gimmicks or shortcuts.The school buys every student their own textbooks to encourage independent study and there is an in-house team of five Oxbridge graduates solely dedicated to university access, he says.Mr Dobin added: “But the key is to keep telling your students that they\u0027re capable, that they\u0027re good enough. We need to shake off the idea that Oxford and Cambridge are just for an \u0027elite\u0027 couple of students and encourage everyone to apply.The oversubscribed sixth form accepts 300 students a year following an interview process.

This includes ensuring the accuracy of official statistics. But despite these responsibilities, the Authority has refused repeatedly to correct the problem,” the committee said.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSince 2010, when there was a change in the way clothing prices were averaged, there has been an 0.8 per cent gap, on average, between the annual rate of RPI inflation and the growth of the Consumer Price Index, up from 0.5\u0026nbspper cent previously.\u0026nbspThe majority of experts agree that the RPI is upwardly biased.UK inflation hits two-year low as petrol prices fallThe UK Statistics Authority, which was formed in 2008, says the reason it has not ordered the Office for National Statistics, which it oversees, to reform the way it calculates RPI is because this would impact many UK Government bond holders, whose payments are linked to RPI, and any reform would require the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The chair of the Authority, Sir David Norgrove,\u0026nbspinformed the committee\u0026nbspin his testimony\u0026nbspthat there was no point doing so because he expected the Chancellor would simply refuse and that it would be a more productive use of his time to put pressure on ministers to stop using the RPI for regulated prices and to use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) instead.But the committee, which includes two former Chancellors and senior Treasury officials, said this stance was “untenable”.“Rather than pre-empting the decision of the Chancellor, it should fulfil its statutory duty to promote and safeguard the quality of official statistics and to do that, it should request a fix to the clothing problem,” it said.“The Chancellor should approve this change regardless of the effects on index-linked gilt holders, holders of which before 2010 received an unwarranted windfall.”The RPI’s status as a “national statistic” was revoked in 2013, but the ONS continues to compile it because it is required to do so by legislation. The index is used as a benchmark for £435bn of inflation-linked government bonds.It is also used in the calculation of student loan interest and increased in train fares.The problem in the RPI relates to a flawed formula and its interaction with a change in the collection of the prices of women’s tops.It has been estimated that around £1bn a year in excess interest is paid to bond investors by taxpayers due to the 2010 RPI change.But in other areas the Government has been accused of “inflation shopping” for its own benefit.The chairman of the Lords committee, Michael Forsyth, said: “When the government gives money to people it is generally opting to adjust payments for inflation using the CPI. But when it takes money from people, it is generally opting to use the RPI, which has been around 1 per cent\u0026nbsphigher than CPI in recent years. This simply is not fair.”In response to the Lords committee’s report, the UK Statistics Authority said it agreed that the RPI had “significant shortcomings” and it would “continue to work closely with our counterparts in government and at the Bank of England and respond to the committee”.The most recent data shows CPI inflation at 2.1\u0026nbspper cent in December 2018 and RPI inflation at 2.7 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Angry at living under feudal rules, this\u0026nbspclass of mortgaged renters want the homes they paid for, says Harry ScoffinClick to followThe IndependentIllustrations by Dilruba TayfunThe sun is out in London’s\u0026nbspDocklands. In the emerging metropolis at the east side of the capital, where cranes are a permanent feature of the skyline and one-bed flats can go for up to a million pounds, trendy Hubbub Bar \u0026amp Kitchen is the last place you would expect to hear words like injustice and exploitation.\u0026nbspOutside in the beer garden, local residents gather over drinks to discuss possible names for a new self-help group. “Leasehold Freedom Fighters” is rejected for sounding too political. After some discussion, they settle on “Friends in High Places”.\u0026nbspAs the first meeting concludes, contact details are exchanged. They plan to meet again.With Canary Wharf on the doorstep, and the long-awaited Elizabeth Line set to make the West End a 12-minute hop away, it is striking to find people so unhappy with where they are living.\u0026nbspBut leasehold does not care if you are rich or poor. It preys on those who have the home ownership dream, keen to avoid paying sky-high rents.This erse group s bankers, media types, public sector and office workers, alongside retirees. Some have lived in the area long before its re-development and gentrification. While it might be difficult to shed a tear for those fortunate enough to have bought in such a sought-after location, these people have in fact found common cause with a group of northern working-class mums, who last year established the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC) to tackle similar issues.Rent arrears more than double under universal credit, figures showFrom newbuild houses on private estates across the northwest, to fancy flats in the shiny residential towers crowding the Isle of Dogs, properties originally marketed as offering ‘home ownership’ are uniting people up and down the country in a shared concern.As London expands and demand for homes across the southeast continues to grow, developers are building ever higher and at much greater densities. Leasehold tenure is exploding as more and more flats are constructed.\u0026nbspUnfortunately, many of\u0026nbspthose who do manage to leave the rental market, proudly brandishing the keys to their new home, fail to understand what leasehold means until it’s too late.When you “buy”\u0026nbspa leasehold flat, you are buying the right to occupy it for a certain length of time. Think of it as a long-term rental, with the minimum term 99 years. You pay most of this upfront. You’ll probably have to take out a mortgage to cover the purchase costs.\u0026nbspBut it’s not ‘yours’.\u0026nbspYou don’t own the flat, the building, or any of the land on which it sits.\u0026nbspYou have effectively signed up to become a renter with a mortgage.\u0026nbspEven the law calls you a tenant.The landowner, known as the freeholder, nominally owns the building and is your landlord. He or she will appoint a managing agent to run the estate, often on a\u0026nbspcommission basis. The freeholder\u0026nbspenjoys an annual ground rent from you, which is essentially\u0026nbspprofit, unconnected to services that might be provided to tenants (cleaning of communal areas, for instance), which also come at a cost.Through control of the managing agent, the landlord can choose how high the service charges are set (although the law states that charges must be ‘reasonable’). And he has the all-important power to award contracts to anyone he chooses to undertake works, irrespective of the cost, quality or (say critics) even necessity of the job. But you have to pick up the tab. Every time.\u0026nbspThere are short and long leases, with leases running down to below the 80-year mark deeply unattractive and hard to remortgage.Although your charming estate agent may suggest that a 999-year lease is as good as owning the property outright, this is still a glorified tenancy.\u0026nbspYou will still have to deal with a landlord and his agents\u0026nbspwhen things go wrong.The landlord has the all-important power to award contracts to anyone he chooses, irrespective of the cost, quality or even necessity of the job. But you have to pick up the tab“Recently we have seen an erroneous narrative being propagated that freeholders are ‘noble custodians’ of the building and\u0026nbspserve some valuable service to the leaseholders. Nothing could be further from the truth,” says Louie Burns, managing director of Leasehold Solutions. He describes them as an asset class, using feudal property laws to make themselves owners of the buildings by proxy. “They own the buildings to make as much money as they possibly can from them,” he adds. “It shames us as a nation that this feudal, iniquitous system is still thriving in the 21st century when the rest of the world have rid themselves from it.”But how could such an unjust system come into being in the first place? Home ownership falls more in UK than any other EU countryAfter seizing all land in the name of the crown, and under threat from the landowners he had just dispossessed, the new King William I had to act fast to stay in power. The year was 1067. He consolidated his regime by gifting some of his land to a highly select group of people. These palace favourites, the lords, rushed to break the freehold land into tiny parcels\u0026nbspand sell them on as leases to lesser men\u0026nbspfor agrarian use. The\u0026nbspinnovation allowed for a perpetual form of land ownership. Leasehold would continue to shape patterns of class formation in early modern England, becoming a key instrument of capital accumulation for the wealthy during the industrial revolution. As people deserted the countryside for the cities, the descendants of William the Conqueror’s noble class\u0026nbspwere uniquely well placed to seize the opportunities of this new era. With their monopoly on land, they introduced “building leases”\u0026nbspto allow for the building of flats on their estates. Hard-working people became glorified tenants, with\u0026nbspfreeholders gorging on the ground rents, license and permission fees, building insurance and maintenance charges. Fast-forward 200\u0026nbspyears, and little has changed.With nine\u0026nbspout of 10 newbuild properties being sold as leasehold in London today, this is a rigged market. If you want a flat, it almost has to be leasehold. Although there is an established co-operative mode of property ownership for flats, “share of freehold”, this has been shunned by developers and investors as it offers none of the lucrative opportunities that they enjoy with leasehold.A newer, more advanced form of tenure, “commonhold”, made the statute books in the early 2000s. Commonholders, unlike leaseholders, would own their flats outright and, through an association, own and manage the common areas collectively. With no third-party landlord, residents would be in the driving seat. They would appoint the managing agent. Curiously, London has just one commonhold scheme in existence.Although it was assumed that commonhold would ultimately\u0026nbspmake leasehold obsolete, as savvy buyers sought\u0026nbsptrue home ownership, it never took root because of vested interests and poorly drafted legislation. Conservative MP Crispin Blunt blames leaving it to the market. By splitting the land into freehold and leasehold interests, developers can sell leasehold properties to unsuspecting buyers, pocketing the ground rents through their continued ownership of the freehold, and make a fortune in the process. Still not satisfied, many choose to sell on the freehold to faceless offshore investors. What to Look for When Buying Within a Development“Profit making businesses such as housing developers cannot be expected\u0026nbspto freely and voluntarily disclose their own ‘monetisation maximisation’ model,”\u0026nbspBlunt says.The MP’s intervention raises questions about our democratic politics. Twenty years after\u0026nbspgovernment described the leasehold system as “flawed to its roots”, the question remains:\u0026nbspwhy haven’t we killed it\u0026nbspoff yet? Is the corporate lobbyist really more powerful than the consumer homebuyer?There is growing anger from leaseholders in flats who want to be free of “hold”.\u0026nbspWe hear their stories at the Isle of Dogs beer garden. They have suffered in silence for many years and paid the service charges without question. Yet because these increased\u0026nbspmodestly each year, leaseholders often didn’t know\u0026nbspwhat was happening until they found themselves struggling to sell their leases on the open market. Their home was a depreciating asset all along, even with a residential tenure supposed to last a millennium. The financial nightmare gets even worse when buildings are left to deteriorate –\u0026nbspthe condition of tower blocks has little to no impact on the value of the freehold title or associated ground rent portfolio. The freehold landlord has bought a cash machine. He doesn’t need to worry about keeping the leaseholders happy.And those leaseholders who went\u0026nbsppublic with their experience in the past risked\u0026nbspangering their neighbours, who did\u0026nbspnot want to see the value of their homes affected by negative publicity\u0026nbspsome faced threats of legal action from the freehold landlord. And when your landlord controls every element of the way your block is run, right down to whether your windows get cleaned, it is understandable that many people preferred to stay\u0026nbspquiet.Unsuspecting first-time buyers signed leases with toxic doubling ground rent clauses.\u0026nbspWhen they wanted to buy the freehold, they found it had been sold on to shadowy offshore investors\u0026nbspThings changed when the big developers applied the leasehold model to houses, many of which were made available through the government’s Help to Buy scheme. They targeted the northwest, where 69 per cent\u0026nbspof houses sold in 2016 were leasehold. Unsuspecting first-time buyers signed leases with toxic doubling ground rent clauses. And when they wanted to buy the freehold, they found it had been sold on to shadowy\u0026nbspinvestors who had either taken it off the market or quadrupled the cost.Trapped in unsellable, newbuild leasehold houses, three brave women decided to take on the industry and government. They wielded placards outside new housing developments that were being sold off-plan, warning prospective buyers to avoid leasehold products. They even had themselves chained up as they sat in mock prison cells. Politicians and the media started taking notice, with the wider “fake home ownership”\u0026nbspscandal coming under scrutiny.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingJoanne Darbyshire, a co-founder of the NLC, says the campaign moved quickly to broaden its reach by articulating the experiences of leaseholders in flats. “It didn’t take long for us to realise that the leasehold scandal was so much more than leasehold newbuild houses,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Newbuild flats were also being sold with onerous ground rent terms and we learnt about the immoral and unethical behaviour of a number of freeholders. We knew the NLC had to campaign for all leaseholders.”With more than 12,000 people now part of the NLC Facebook group, which is being used to direct leaseholders to complete consultations on reform, Darbyshire and her fellow campaigners are giving those who live in flats a newfound confidence to stand up and be counted. After the northwest, London is the next highest represented area on the NLC.Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick, whose constituents are attempting to overcome collective action problems with Friends in High Places, says: “Whether it is spiralling service charges, inflated refurbishment costs, fraudulent insurance premiums, obstructing residents’ associations being formed or various other ways to cheat decent residents, including forfeiture, the rules have to change.” His Poplar and Limehouse constituency has the second highest number of leasehold properties in the country, after the City\u0026nbspof London and City of Westminster. In 2016, Poplar and Limehouse saw the highest number of leasehold properties sold across England and Wales, at 97 per cent.Whether it is spiralling service charges, inflated refurbishment costs, fraudulent insurance premiums, or various other ways to cheat decent residents, including forfeiture, the rules have to changeAnxious to ease the housing crisis, Tower Hamlets council is\u0026nbspapproving leasehold developments all the time. It\u0026nbspdid not respond to requests for data on what some have identified as a new, more disturbing trend within the murky world of leasehold. The emergence of mixed-use schemes, where squeezed local authority and prospective buyer are enticed by the prospect of building a new school, doctors’ surgery, bars, restaurants and shops under newbuild flats, demonstrates the way leasehold is taking over. Where buildings are over 25 per cent\u0026nbspnon-residential, developers have artfully curtailed residential rights to almost nothing.An investor who gains the freehold of a mixed-use building can use his total control of the service charges from the residential floors to subsidise his commercial operations. Of course he’s not supposed to do this, but the ease with which service charge accounts can be delayed and fudged, and residential spending conflated with commercial makes it a temptation few will resist. If you don’t need to pick up the tab, why would you?The freehold landlord is safe in the knowledge that while\u0026nbspleaseholders theoretically hold the power to win disputes at\u0026nbspthe property tribunal, the chances of them finding the time and resources to cobble a case together against him are slim. People have lives, families, jobs. How many can dedicate the months, if not years, a legal battle can take? And why should a flat dweller have to go to court to force his landlord to clean his windows or repair his lifts or employ decent door staff for a reasonable cost? Especially when that landlord can bill him through the service charge for his own legal costs. Yes, go to the tribunal and if you lose you cold pay both sides’ legal costs. Think of that playground game where the bully forces his victim to smack himself round his own face and you’ve pretty much got the leaseholder’s plight.And to top it all off, the tribunal is not even a court equivalent. According to Christopher Howarth, a senior researcher working in the House of Commons:\u0026nbsp“It does not have the time or interest for long and complex cases, does not take evidence on oath and is easily swayed by the legal firepower at the disposal of large landlords.”Lacking the ability to break free of “hold”\u0026nbspby buying out the freeholder, through a process known as enfranchisement, and also barred from the Right to Manage (RTM), a way of cutting out the landlord by making the managing agent accountable to leaseholders only, flat dwellers in mixed-use developments are in a special kind of leasehold hell.The Law Commission, which has been tasked by government to review the law on enfranchisement to make it “easier, cheaper and quicker”, claims there is no need to change the arbitrary 25 per cent\u0026nbsprule. As developers move away from buildings that are predominantly residential, officials seem to be turning a blind eye to the fact that many more families and young people are set to fall into the leasehold property trap. The Law Commission has been\u0026nbspinviting views on its enfranchisement. Leaseholders will certainly be kept busy, with a commission spokesperson confirming that “the Right to Manage consultation paper will be published in early 2019, and the consultation will last for two months”.They say reform is on its way. But John Paterson, a veteran leasehold campaigner, is not hopeful. He says the government has known about the outrageous racket of leasehold housing since the 1980s. But there has been no meaningful change.High hopes for rent-to-own clampdown but UK’s poorest will struggleX Factor finalists’ house for rent for £12.5k a monthWhat’s next for Generation Rent?Paterson feels sure he knows where this latest chapter will end. “The government likes to stick with 1925 Law of Property and the idea of caveat emptor.\u0026nbspIt will consider that it has warned of the problems of leasehold tenure and, therefore, if iniduals fail to heed these warnings it is their own fault.”Paterson is not far off. The current administration seems content to sit back and watch existing leaseholders face surging ground rents. It hides behind the argument that intervention would set a ‘dangerous’ precedent. However, they are not warning of the problems of applying leasehold to flats. If anything, they have embarked on “Project Save Leasehold”. While\u0026nbspThatcher, Major and Blair envisaged the end of leasehold, May’s administration defends the feudal system. The ruling party sees a cross-class alliance conspiring to bring it down –\u0026nbspand it doesn’t like it. Just last month, Heather Wheeler, the minister for housing and homelessness, claimed in parliament that “leasehold can be an effective tool for making multiple-ownership more straightforward”. Within minutes, her claim was ridiculed online. In surprising numbers, leaseholders were citing US condominium and Australian strata-title as superior models to the leasehold regime.Wheeler’s colleague, the housing secretary James Brokenshire, has demonstrated his personal commitment to “Project Save Leasehold”. He is engaging in what campaigners have called “death-by-consultation”. Not only that, he is actively sabotaging the plans of his predecessor, Sajid Javid. Private Eye says choosing to set ground rents on new leases at £10, as opposed to making them zero financial value, will ensure leasehold persists.With a housing target of 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s, existing leaseholders are pained at the thought of yet more innocent homebuyers falling into the leasehold property trap.\u0026nbspAs a party which\u0026nbspsays it is\u0026nbspcommitted to the principle of home ownership, it is ironic that the Conservatives are effectively\u0026nbspforbidding young people from owning their own homes by allowing flats to be sold as tenancies. England and Wales are the only countries left that have this feudal system. In failing to act against this burning injustice, the Conservative Party may very well be signing its death warrant.Back in the Isle of Dogs beer garden, leaseholders mention a new development going up. They call it “Desmond Town”. Richard Desmond, the ex-press baron, wants to create an income stream of more than 1,500 new homes. There will be a new secondary school, healthcare services, lifestyle facilities, and restaurants and bars. Unfortunately, residents will have no way of buying him out. And if current rules stay the same, they will have no ability to get control of their building and service charges. As London Docklands continues to be a construction site, Friends in High Places has a huge fight on its\u0026nbsphands to end leasehold for good.help to buyOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The streaming service almost doubled operating profit in the fourth quarter - it rose from $245m (£189m) in the last three months of 2017 to $447m - and revenue grew to $3.7bn from $3.3bn.

Meanwhile, although Netflix reported annual profit of $1.6bn, the company spent $13bn on ramping up production of original content such as Bird Box and Roma. Netflix responds to criticism for using disaster footage in Bird BoxNetflix reveals huge viewing figures for You and Sex EducationSteve Carell to star in Netflix comedy inspired by Trump\u0027s Space ForceNetflix to raise prices for 58 million subscribers across USThe company also recently announced that it would raise subscription prices for its 58 million US users, the first price hike since 2017. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was notable that Netflix is “now confident enough to use price increases to slash its cash flow deficit even faster”.“You can only squeeze customers so far, but we think there’s a way to go before the pips squeak. The average customer spends around 10 hours a week on the service, which works out at around 25 cents an hour. Hard to argue that isn’t value for money,” he added.“The worry, of course, is that international bruisers like Disney and Amazon aren’t going to go down without a fight, and both have the financial clout to counterpunch pretty hard. The battle for viewers’ eyeballs is only just getting started.”Analysts also pointed out that Thursday’s share price movement should be taken in the context of 50 per cent stock growth since Christmas Eve. “The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said Paul Verna, media analyst at eMarketer. “The bottom line is that Netflix remains the uncontested leader in the subscription video space.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But using a Nasa craft in orbit around the Moon, the scientists have been able to estimate the age of craters for the first time.Fossil of gigantic ‘mammal-like’ reptile discovered in PolandBones of new species of vegetarian dinosaur found in BrazilLargest dinosaur foot ever recorded came from brachiosaur, study finds“The relative rarity of large craters on Earth older than 290 million years and younger than 650 million years is not because we lost the craters, but because the impact rate during that time was lower than it is now,” said Rebecca Ghent, an associate professor at the University of Toronto and one of the paper’s co-authors. Thermal data and images collected by Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which has been circling the Moon since 2009, has allowed scientists to determine the size of soil and rocks surrounding a crater. During the lunar night, bigger rocks radiate more heat than finer lunar soil.In conjunction with data on how long it takes for Moon rock to break down into soil, it was revealed the size and number of large rocks near a crater give an indication of that crater’s age. Younger craters tend to be covered with more boulders and rocks than older craters. This breakdown is caused over hundreds of millions of years by the “constant rain of tiny meteorites”, the research team said. “The LRO’s instruments have allowed scientists to peer back in time at the forces that shaped the Moon,” said Noah Petro, an LRO project scientist based at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland.The findings on the Moon were supported by geological studies on Earth. The team in Toronto worked with the University of Southampton’s Thomas Gernon, who studies a terrestrial feature called kimberlite pipes.Created with Sketch.Dinosaurs in the Wild  Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildThese “pipes”, formed over the last 650 millions years, are the subterranean remnants of long extinct volcanoes, which stretch down in a carrot shape “a couple of kilometres” below the surface. The hardness of the rock means they remain some of the least eroded areas on our planet. Dr Gernon found the crater records in these areas correlate closely with those of the Moon. The research suggests crater formation over the last 290 million years has been as much as three times higher than in the previous 700 million years.“It was a painstaking task, at first, to look through all of these data and map the craters out without knowing whether we would get anywhere or not,” said Sara Mazrouei, lead author of the paper who analysed all the data for the project at the University of Toronto.But she said the study now “provides evidence for a dramatic change in the rate of asteroid impacts on both Earth and the Moon that occurred around the end of the Paleozoic era.”New dog-sized dinosaur species found in AustraliaIt is not known why there was this rapid escalation in the number of asteroid strikes on the Earth and the Moon, but the team have suggested it could be related to huge collisions taking place in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Such events can create debris that can reach the inner solar system.Dinosaurs proliferated about 250 million years ago, and “as a species were particularly vulnerable to large impacts from the get-go, more so than earlier animal groups”, said Dr Gernon.“It’s perhaps fair to say it was a date with destiny for the dinosaurs – their downfall was somewhat inevitable given the surge of large space rocks colliding with Earth,” he added.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That machine could start operation in the late 2050s.\u0026nbspThe concept paper, five years in the making, aimed to explore prospects of tantalizingly more powerful particle colliders that can inaugurate the post-LHC era in high-energy physics, CERN said on its website.Scientists discover new subatomic particle at Large Hadron ColliderUltimately, the FCC would include a superconducting proton accelerator ring with energy of up to 100 tera electron volts, compared with a maximum 17 TeV in the current collider.\u0026nbspCERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti called the report a remarkable achievement that could help boost understanding of fundamental physics and advance technologies.\u0026nbspCERN said it was not possible to say exactly what benefits the new collider would bring to the world, but pointed out that the discovery of the electron in 1897 led to the electronics industry that now contributes $3 trillion annually to the world economy.The proposal came out of the European strategy for particle physics, which recommended that design and feasibility studies be conducted in order for Europe to be in a position to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project at CERN by the time of the next strategy update.But the decision on whether to go ahead with the FCC - incurring an initial 9 billion euro ($10.25 billion) bill for participating governments plus a later 15 billion euro upgrade - is effectively part of an international race to host the LHC\u0027s successor, with China, Japan, the United States and Europe all interested.Any big machine for the future will be a global machine, said Arnaud Marsollier, head of media relations at CERN.No one expects to have two 100-km colliders built in the next 20 years, so if one is built in China, maybe Europe will do something else.The LHC is expected to keep running until around 2036-2040, by which time it will have done its job collecting data, but it might also be possible to upgrade it by increasing the energy of collisions, which would require major investment.China has floated plans for its own 100-km collider, but has not yet confirmed it will go ahead.Japan is expected to take a decision on a linear collider in March, which could play into a potential choice by European countries in 2020 about whether to back the FCC or another proposal for CERN, the Compact Linear Collider.For physicists, the location may be less important than the science opportunities on offered by a new collider, allowing them to peer into the debris left when subatomic particles smash together and shatter into even smaller pieces, some of which may answer fundamental questions about the universe.But science mega-projects attract talent and can generate unforeseen spin-offs - including the invention of the World Wide Web at CERN, which has become a global centre for physicists, despite the high cost of living around Geneva.The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 earned Peter Higgs and Francois Englert the 2013 Nobel prize. They had predicted half a century earlier that it would one day be discovered.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scientists were able to weigh the rings by measuring their gravitational pull.Just before Nasa\u0027s Cassini spacecraft fell into Saturn and destroyed itself, it flew between the rings and the planet itself, allowing scientists to watch how they tugged it around during the flight. That meant the spacecraft could act as a gravity probe, measuring how much pull the rings themselves had.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe researchers found that estimate – which showed they had about 40 per cent of the pull of Saturn\u0027s moon Mimas, itself about 2,000 times smaller than our own Moon – shows the rings are relatively new. They must have originated less than 100 million years ago and might be only 10 million years old, the data showed.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Some argued the rings must have arrived alongside the planet, some 4.5 billion years, formed out of ice that was left behind when the solar system came together – others argued that they were much newer and came about when an object was destroyed and became rubble that orbited around the planet.Researchers found themselves initially\u0026nbspshocked by the data they received back from Cassini and what it seemed to suggest about the ring\u0027s gravity. But they then accounted for the fact Saturn has deep flowing winds and the measurements started to make sense.The first time I looked at the data I didn\u0027t believe it, because I trusted our models and it took a while to sink in that there was some effect that changed the gravity field that we had not considered, said Burkhard Militzer, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, who models planetary interiors. That turned out to be massive flows in the atmosphere at least 9,000 kilometers deep around the equatorial region. We thought preliminarily that these clouds were like clouds on Earth, which are confined to a thin layer and contain almost no mass. But on Saturn they are really massive.It is still not clear how the vast rings managed to form so recently, according to the study\u0027s authors. But the researchers say that the surprising discovery of the ring\u0027s youth is a fitting way to end Cassini\u0027s mission, and marks one of a range of surprising discoveries about the planet and the rings that surround it.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s still us. We’re still Slack. But more consistent and, we hope, more instantly recognizable.Previous companies to spark a strong reaction for changing its logo include\u0026nbspAirbnb, which replaced its lowercase \u0027a\u0027 logo for a looping design in 2014.People were quick to point out the new logo\u0027s apparent similarity to various parts of the body – one in particular.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has made a number of changes to deal with a no-deal Brexit – as well as the possible disruption caused even by\u0026nbspan orderly withdrawal.Who is responsible for the EU’s no-deal preparations?Responsibility for the EU’s no-deal preparations is split between the European Commission\u0026nbspin Brussels, and the 27 EU member states themselves.Plan for parliament to seize control of Brexit gains momentumAll the member states will have to make some kind of preparations, but some will be more affected than others.France, the Netherlands\u0026nbspand Belgium will bear the brunt, as they\u0026nbsphave the closest links with the UK because of their geographical location. Spain also faces extra challenges due to the proximity of Gibraltar.In Brussels, the EU’s general secretary Martin Selmayr, who leads its civil service, is personally in charge of no-deal prep.What is the European Commission itself doing to prepare for a no-deal scenario?The European Commission has issued dozens of “preparedness notices” to help inform businesses about how they might be affected when the UK leaves.\u0026nbspThese are sorted into different policy areas, ranging from public procurement\u0026nbspto environment – often down to minute detail.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThere is, for instance, a three-page notice dedicated to occupational retirement pensions. Inland waterways get\u0026nbsptheir own notice, as do slaughterhouse operators.The commission has also made a number changes to its own structures. It has relocated the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority, drawn up new guidelines on visas, and issued new regulations on air transport, ship inspection, and car-type approval – among other tidying-up exercises.A\u0026nbspsenior EU official will also be dispatched to each member state to help no-deal prep.What are inidual EU countries doing to get prepared?Different EU countries have different interactions with the UK, and are making different preparations accordingly.\u0026nbspFor some states, the main issue is what happens to British citizens living within their borders\u0026nbspin the event of a no-deal Brexit. Because UK nationals will no longer be able to live and work in EU countries by default, states have to decide what to do with them. This is the responsibility of member states, not the EU as a whole.Most countries are creating\u0026nbspsome kind of registration scheme for existing British nationals, and have guaranteed their rights even\u0026nbspin the event of a no-deal scenario – though some have been quicker than others.Other countries have a closer relationship with the UK. The Netherlands deals with a lot of trade bound for the UK, so the Dutch government has hired 1,000 extra customs officers for the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol airport, which are both major hubs into the UK. These staff will be needed to deal with the extra customs checks a no-deal would bring.On 28 January it will be launching a major information campaign for businesses, which the government says have not moved quickly enough to prepare.France’s national assembly has, meanwhile, granted the French government sweeping emergency powers to deal with all aspects of a no-deal Brexit. France is investing €50m (£44m)\u0026nbspin its ports, appointing as many as 580 customs and regulatory staff, who will be needed to check produce going into and out of the UK.\u0026nbspThe focus in France is on expanding control points and parking areas to help cope with the long queues expected to form.The Irish government has dropped low priority government business in order to focus on no-deal planning. It is making technical preparations in areas such as health, communications, education, finance, employment and justice – where it has close links to the UK.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

I can’t imagine we would look favourably on those who’ve cheated centuries of procedure.”That said, it is also quite a confident move from Downing Street - assuming the government will still be standing when it comes to approving the peerage at a future date.\u0026nbspA spokesperson for the speaker declined to comment on the report when approached by The Independent.\u0026nbspAs the brinkmanship over cross-party talks over Brexit continued in Westminster, reports have emerged that the civil service chief, Sir Mark Sedwill, has told departmental heads to be prepared for an snap election, according to the Daily Mail.\u0026nbspThe newspaper said the civil service chief has met with senior officials this week, following the historic defeat of Theresa May’s Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday - forcing her her to open talks with other parties.Asked about the report, a Cabinet office spokesperson told The Independent: “The Cabinet secretary frequently meets permanent secretaries to discuss a wide range of issues.”Ms May, however, has consistently said there will be no general election before 2022, and earlier this week said it would be the “worst thing we could do” and\u0026nbsp “bring chaos when we need certainty” as she urged the Commons to reject a no confidence motion.It comes as Mr Corbyn has in recent days set Labour on an election war-footing, with a rally on Thursday in Hastings - the seat of the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, who held the constituency by a wafer thin majority at the 2017 snap election.\u0026nbspBritain has been urged to stay in the EU by more than a dozen high-profile Germans, including the frontrunner to succeed Angela Merkel as the next chancellor.\u0026nbspAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Airbus chief Tom Enders and former Germany footballer Jens Lehmann are among the signatories of a letter to The Times that makes an impassioned plea for Britons to remain part of the bloc.From the bottom of our hearts, we want them to stay, the sentimental letter says, citing milky tea and post-work pints at the pub among the habits best-loved by German Anglophiles.But it is the UK\u0027s role in post-war Europe that the signatories highlight as a foremost reason for wanting Britain to stay.Without your great nation, this Continent would not be what it is today: a community defined by freedom and prosperity, the letter says.After the horrors of the Second World War, Britain did not give up on us. It has welcomed Germany back as a sovereign nation and a European power.This we, as Germans, have not forgotten and we are grateful.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

Failing this, a general election will be called.The last time a motion of no confidence successfully received the required support of MPs was in 1979 - by just one vote.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe it will come after her defeat.TORY liar Dominic Grieve is setting fire to our Parliament and democracy.Here is a man who promised voters in  that the referendum verdict “must be respected” and any fears that Parliament would thwart it “were entirely misplaced”. He meant none of it.Parliament is not only plotting to thwart Brexit, Grieve is behind it.Always a rabid Remainer, he is the architect of a sickening ruse to strip the Government of power and halt Brexit.It is an act of naked contempt for .million ordinary people. An attempt by a sneering elite to nully their decision so the “right people” can get their way.They are saying: democracy is worthless.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this. Think about what it says about the state of British politics.The people vote in historic numbers to leave the EU. Yet the political class plot and conspire to make sure we do not.It is hard to think of another time in living memory when politicians have been so ­spectacularly out of touch with public sentiment — and so ­sinisterly cavalier about overriding our democratic wishes.There are honourable exceptions, of course. From Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Tory camp to Kate Hoey on the Labour benches, some MPs will opposeMay’s deal precisely because they believe in Brexit and plan to carry on fighting for it.But a majority of MPs fall into one of the two Brexit-phobic camps — whether it’s May’s “Remain by another name” or those who would stop Brexit entirely.Some MPs are terryingly upfront about their distaste for the democratic process and their disgust with us, the pesky ­electorate.In an unhinged online rant, Labour MP Clive Lewis branded Brexit a “racist endeavour” and said “we need to end it, now”. Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To allow Brussels,it wanted, to keep us bound hand and foot forever in the Irish backstop, unable to forge our own independent trading policy.It would rapidly have become clear to the Leave majority that their decision, while nominally honoured, had been sold down the river. That we had not truly left the EU and maybe never would.More practically it all but guaranteed the collapse of the minority Tory Government since,it had somehow passed, the DUP would have withdrawn their support.The Government was always going to lose heavily. The discredited Commons speaker John Bercow ensured it by refusing to select any amendments to the Bill that might have helped narrow the margin of defeat.It was another low for a man who has already brought disgrace to his historic office by abusing his powers to help engineer the destruction of Brexit. Parliament will be a better place without him.But let’s not pretend it would have made much dference. The deal was fatally flawed.Mrs May’s response to the vote last night was feisty — challenging Parliament to find a viable alternative that could win a majority and honour the ­referendum. No one has a clue what that would be.And her call for MPs to “listen to the British people” was dead right.Outside Westminster, the public just wants Brexit done. They are aghast at the political games.The Sun reluctantly believes we must head for a clean break, finalise preparations as best we can and batten down the hatches.We never wanted a No Deal. It would mean a tough and probably damaging few months. But it would be the only solution left which defends what should now be paramount and most precious to us all: Our democracy — and the public’s faith in it.None of the alternatives does that.  They neither honour the referendum, nor are possible to sustain.They are all damaging in their own way. Yet our Remainer-dominated Parliament will fight tooth and nail to secure one of them and thwart a clean break, in direct conflict with millions of voters.The Norway-Plus proposal, however its champions spin it, is EU membership without the voting rights. No independent trade ­policy. No end to free movement.It is a short-term Remainers’ Brexit which would lead to only one ­conclusion: A new and irresistible clamour to exit properly.Another Tory idea is to lure Labour support by offering the permanent customs union they want with the EU, abandoning all thoughts of independent trade. It is a potentially suicidal idea which could destroy their Party and put Corbyn’s Marxists in power.Then there’s the toxic second referendum which would upend our democracy, shatter trust in politicians for all time and burst fully open our national isions.Its only upside is that Leave would probably win again. Plenty of the more sensible Remainers have seen through the EU now — and dislike the blatant unfairness of overriding a democratic mandate before it has been enacted.But what would the question be  Remain versus a deal already now rejected by a monstrous Commons majority as bad for Britain And whatRemain DID win  It is staggeringly naive to imagine that would settle it. Why should Leavers accept it  The wounds would never heal.Labour appears almost ready now to buckle to its europhile members and back that second vote — and its betrayal of millions of left-leaning Leave voters will finally be complete.Shadow Cabinet ministers are already teeing it up, laughably attempting to deflect blame by claiming Tory failure gives them no option. Don’t believe a word.The Tories have dedicated nearly three years trying to see Brexit through while Labour have tried to thwart every effort and their Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer has secretly lobbied relentlessly for a ​new referendum. Labour will own every ounce of the betrayal their working-class voters will feel — and will richly deserve the ballot box backlash.Mrs May has had the hardest task of any Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, trying to fulfil the Brexit mandate with no majority in a Parliament stuffed with Remainers, some colluding with the EU to sabotage her position.Even so, her handling of it has been a woeful failure.She is clinging to power by her fingernails. And only a fool would predict now what happens  to her, her Government, Brexit or Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Disgracefully, this attempt is being led by the Gloomster of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.This is just another version of ’s Project Fear that was launched by the Treasury to try to persuade us against voting for Brexit by prophesying disasterwe did. Some prophecy that turned out to be! Project Fear Mark II is just as ridiculous.That said, Brexit has always been primarily about politics, rather than economics. The strongest argument for it is quite simply that we should be free to make our own decisions. But there is a connection with economics, because freedom includes being able to make decisions about economic matters.Moreover,people could be persuaded that re-establishing self-government for our country would carry a heavy cost that would hit them in the pocket, many might be dissuaded from supporting it.But it would NOT carry a heavy cost. Quite the opposite. It would bring large gains.Listening to the Remainers who dominate the BBC’s coverage, you might easily believe that the EU is a raging economic success. It isn’t. Yes, it was a relative success when we joined it in . But over recent decades the EU’s relative economic performance has been poor.The reason is clear: The EU makes bad decisions, including about economic matters, because its institutions don’t work very well and it is pursuing a political project, namely the establishment of a federal state. In the process, it is pushing barmy policies of harmonisation and integration and it engages in excessive regulation. The euro is the worst of the EU’s blunders — so far. But you can be sure that there will be more.Nowhere  are countries pursuing anything like the EU’s mad agenda — no single markets, no monetary unions and no federal super-states. Unlike so many members of our elite, other countries’ leaders have noticed that the EU doesn’t work.So why are so many clever and decent people among our leaders apparently still keen that Britain should stay in the EU  There are two reasons. First, many of them simply don’t know the facts about economic performance and don’t understand economics anyway.People with little experience of business who are steeped in the world of politics or the civil service naturally tend to assume that prosperity flows from the pens of those who sign agreements. People like them. But it doesn’t. It derives quite simply from the efforts of millions of men and women and of the businesses that employ them.Yes, trade deals can be good, but you do not need them in order to trade. Currently we do not have a trade deal with the United States. Yet the US is our biggest single trading partner. Go figure!Second, many among our governing elite do not like nation states. And they particularly don’t like ours. By contrast, they have a touching faith in the EU’s ability to suppress the uglier sides of nationalism while keeping the peace and pursuing an agenda of good government for all. Doubtless they also believe in Father Christmas.If we leave the EU in March without signing a deal, we would not be “crashing out” or “falling off a clf”. Nor would it be accurate to describe this as a “hard” Brexit.Rather, it would be a clean Brexit, a full Brexit, a true Brexit, in contrast to the half-baked non-Brexit proposed by Mrs May.Mrs May’s “deal” was the Remainers’ Revenge. You only had to look at the expression on the face of Jean-Claude Juncker to know what had happened.The EU got everything while we got nothing. And we were due to pay £billion for the privilege.Now that Mrs May’s capitulation of a “deal” has been consigned to the knackers yard, we should devote our energies to preparing to leave in March without any such deal. I am not suggesting that a No- Deal Brexit would be roses all the way. There would be some immediate dislocation that would carry some costs. But they would be relatively minor and short-lived. And it would be wrong to mistake such short-term minor disruption for the eventual destination.Just like umpteen other countries around the world, we can thrive outside the EU — without anything like Mrs May’s deal.Within a few years I am sure we would look back and wonder how anyone could have thought otherwise.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was there because I tried to take my own le, I couldnt take it any more.My husband was there because of his back, its painful being in the car.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

Winston is  this year and when you reach  youre entitled to sheltered housing.However his birthday is in May and we could be dead by then. Im worried we are going to die here.Universal Credit is the Governments new flagship benefits system, but it has been slammed by charities and claimants who say it is pushing more people into poverty.Currently it takes five weeks to get the first payment, leaving many people in insurmountable debt, and working families have to pay childcare costs upfront, before later claiming back  per cent of the cost.The Sun is campaigning for the Work Allowance to be raised and the taper rate reduced to p for every £ earned to help at least four million families hold on to their hard earned cash.A spokesman for Colchester Borough Homes warned could take up to two years for some people to get a home.As a general rule this meansany applicant presents as homeless and we believe they may have a priority need, we may have a duty to provide accommodation while we look to find a housing solution that relieves their homelessness.If we do not believe they have a priority need, accommodation will not be provided but we will still assist them to secure alternative accommodation.If we are unable to relieve their homelessness, we are required to make inquiries under the full or main homeless duty.If we accept this duty, temporary accommodation will be provided and their banding on the housing register will be amended to reflect this.Applicants will then remain in temporary accommodation until they are either housed through the housing register or we end the duty by placing them in private sector accommodation.It is dficult to determine theof time an applicant will have to wait for specic property types to become available, as applicants are able to decide this by bidding on properties.In general, most applicants wait in excess of  to  months."},{"url":null,"title":"dover python loose snake spotted back garden","story":"The monster serpent was spotted slithering under a fence and into an alley between houses in Kent on Monday night.Local resident Mark Smith, , who owns two giant Burmese pythons, was notied of the escaped animal when his friend called him to say hed seen a snakes head pop out under a fence while he was walking home.Snake-loving Smith, whose pets were safely locked away when the escaped reptile was sighted, then went out looking for it and posted about the incident on Facebook.But the python still hasnt been found.Smith told Kent Live: I got over there just before midnight to look for it.

Then whack, I’m part of a royal soap opera.”The simple answer is that I have enjoyed every moment of it, or, more accurately, almost every moment of it. It gets me into the fresh air and it keeps me reasonably fit.I suppose I could just drive about the country but the challenge of the competition is a great inducement to get out and practise, even when the weather conditions might be a bit discouraging.Although the Prince faced a number of health scares beyond the age of , he continued to stay behind the wheel.He even drove Barack Obama around when the then US President came to visit in April .Abdominal surgery, bladder infections and a blocked coronary artery have seen him admitted to hospital on a number of occasions.Concerns were expressed for Philips health when he appeared to lean against a pillar for support while standing during the Whitehall service.But a week later he was carriage driving at Windsor on the day of his platinum wedding anniversary, and he and the Queen celebrated in the evening with a party for more than  family and friends.And this summer break he made a remarkable bounce back to health when he was seen fishing and hunting.In September the Prince was last seen taking his Land Rover out for a spin near Balmoral in September.Donning a pair of trusty spectacles, the -year-old drove alone on the A Braemar while on his way back to Balmoral Castle.Royal biographer Hugo Vickers told BBC News: Any kind of car accident at the age of  is likely to produce shock.Some years ago he gave up flying planes long before he needed to because he was scared thatsomething happened there would be a lot of criticism.You know, why was he, at the age of , still flying a plane when he should have retired at  or something like that.So he does listen to these things - hes very, very sensible.If anyones involved in a car accident, its quite a frightening thing.

He is happy to hang around with Stalinists and anti-Semites, Holocaust deniers and apologists for terrorism. But he won’t talk to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.The Labour leader’s refusal to discuss Brexit with his Tory — and come to that, Lib Dem, SNP, DUP and Plaid Cymru — counterparts reveals the utter smallness of the man.For two years, Jezza has been noisily demanding that Theresa May “reach out” to other parties. Yet the moment she does, he comes over all snooty and stand-offish.He won’t join any discussions about our EU policy unless and until the PM pledges that we won’t leave without a deal.That condition is absurd. Mrs May, as Corbyn well knows, is also keen to avoid No Deal. But the only way to avoid that is to agree on, you know, a deal.That’s precisely why the PM is talking to the other party leaders.The only effect of publicly ruling out No Deal — as several MPs in all parties have been pompously doing — is to encourage Brussels to dig in and thus, paradoxically, to make No Deal more likely.What explains Jezza’s sudden coolness  Is it simple tribalism of the sort that has now taken over the top ranks of Labour Immediately before the vote, for example, Richard Burgon, the Corbynite Shadow Justice Secretary, repeatedly described Conservatives on TV as “the real enemy”.After the confidence motion, another Labour MP, Danielle Rowley, posted a picture of the Conservative benches with the caption, “People are dying because of these people”.Is Corbs unwilling to talk to Tories because he sees them as evil murderers I don’t think so. Part of the old booby’s schtick is that he will talk to anyone. It’s how he justies his meetings with Irish Republicans and jihadi extremists.It’s how he justies taking money to appear on a TV station backed by the ayatollahs in Tehran.He has even said that he would be prepared to negotiate with the head-hackers of IS in order to facilitate peace.I don’t think so.

It would force him to take a public position on Brexit. And that is the last thing he wants to do.Corbyn is an Old Left Eurosceptic. He took what was, effectively, the Moscow line during the Cold War, namely that the EEC was the economic arm of Nato.He disliked what he saw as its capitalism, and knows he will be able to implement a far more radical form of socialism once Britain is no longer constrained by EU rules on competition and state aid.He also knows that the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs want to stay in the EU.During the referendum campaign, he reluctantly went along with his party, though he made little secret of his distaste.Although we’ll never know for sure, I have a strong suspicion, looking at his face as he left the polling station, that he secretly voted Leave.Be that as it may, he has since kept the Labour coalition together by attacking the Government while saying nothing about what he would do.That ambiguity has allowed him to appease his party without alienating the millions in Labour’s northern heartlands who voted Leave.From a self-interest point of view, it made sense. But the impact on Britain’s negotiating position was dire.Labour’s tactic has been to demand impossible conditions from the Government. As Barry Gardiner, the Shadow Trade Minister, was overheard saying in Brussels: “It’s bollocks — always has been bollocks.”The trouble is, that by adopting its testicular conditions, Labour has ended up arguing for something that would represent the worst of all worlds.The main stated dference between the two parties is over the customs union. Labour says it wants Brussels to control Britain’s trade policy in perpetuity after we leave.As recently as last year, Corbyn was against the customs union on the unarguable grounds that “It is protectionist against third- world countries”.That was the reason successive Labour Eurosceptics, as far back as Clement Attlee, opposed joining the EEC.But last February, spotting an opportunity to vote against the Government without having to commit to anything, Labour somersaulted and started demanding customs union membership.Be clear: Being outside the EU but inside its customs union would be disastrous. It would keep the costs of membership without the benefits of leaving.As former Canadian PM Stephen Harper, a massive Anglophile and a Remain supporter in , put it recently: “It is really critical that this country rediscovers itself as a trading nation. If you do not do that, then frankly the Brexit experience will be bad.” When I put that point to another member of the shadow cabinet in a BBC green room, he looked at me asI was mad. We’re this close to the first truly socialist government in Britain,” he told me. “You really think we care about the customs union either way ”Yet it is precisely that cynicism that voters are turning against. People are furious at the game-playing in Westminster. They accept that MPs have dfering views, but they can tell when a party is advancing bogus arguments for purely selfish reasons.In the last analysis, Jeremy Corbyn has shown himself to be unwilling to work in what he himself sees as the national interest. That is what makes him unfit for office.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I just do not understand how grown men can arrange to meet each other and then kick the living daylights out of each. It is absolutely pathetic. They need to grow up. You don’t get it in any other sports.“Simon had not been involved in any trouble. They were ambushed.“Simon was just a normal, family man who went to a football match and had his le destroyed.“If we can stop just one person from joining a group then something has come out of it. Come and spend a day with my husband. I am sure that will change their minds.”Cambridge United fan Simon suffered permanent and le-changing brain damage after he was set upon as he walked to Prittlewell station in Southend, Essex.He had just watched his team in an - away draw with Southend United on March,  .The thugs convicted over the unprovoked, savage attack were handed jail terms totalling more than  years.Basildon Crown Court convicted  of their involvement in the attack.The defendants scouted out locations as they planned the attack in revenge for a fight earlier in the day in which Mr Dobbin had no involvement.They ambushed the small group of Cambridge United supporters and during the violence, Mr Dobbin, from Mildenhall, Suffolk, was kicked and stamped on repeatedly.Police called Simon “a thoroughly decent man” who was the “entirely innocent victim of an unprovoked, savage attack”.Nicole – who is now a full time carer to her husband of nearly  years – is campaigning for tougher laws for those involved football violence.Her husband had deliberately not worn football colours as “he didn’t want any trouble and didn’t want to stand out”.She said: “It was dficult for the police to pin point exactly who did what. I think thatyou are involved then you should face the maximum penalty.“Hopefully then these people would start talking as I certainly wouldn’t want to take the blame for something I didn’t do.“I knew it had been a football related. But when we had to listen to how they attacked him when he was down on the ground – that was really hard to hear.“They left him with a calling card – I actually gasped out loud when I heard details of that.”It read: Congratulations. Youve just met the CS CrewFirst we take your le, then we take your we.In a statement read to court Nicole said: “I told him to enjoy the day but this was the last time I would see the husband I married.”She added: “Police told me my husband had been attacked. The first thing I said was ‘is he dead ’“They told me he was on le support and it was serious.“We were taken to the critical care unit. I could not believe what I was seeing. His face was swollen, you couldn’t see his ear, he had tubes and wires everywhere.“He went into cardiac arrest for seven minutes at the scene.“Now Simon cannot communicate very well. He never says no. He will only say yes. He has to be fed by a tube and needs  hour care, he is prone to choking.“He will never get his le back. I have to do things for Simon that no we should do – and at such a young age.“I try not  to look back at how things were before because it just upsets me.“But there are still signs of him there – it is like he is trapped inside his body. He still has his cheekiness and his sense of humour.”The men were found guilty following a six-week trial at Basildon Crown Court after jurors delivered unanimous verdicts on all but one defendant.Eight men were found to have been directly involved in the violent disorder, while three were involved in a conspiracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream.

In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know.

Jacob Rees-Mogg invited leading Tory eurosceptics including Boris Johnson, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith to a celebration party. Guests were greeted with a champagne flute at the door of the Tory MP’s pound million mansion just minutes from the House of Commons. The other side of Westminster, Theresa May was contemplating her humiliating defeat and steeling herself for another tumultous day ahead. Her strategy for surviving the no confidence vote was to make sure she didn’t take the fizz out of the Brexiteers champagne too early.   Instead, she waited until after the result was announced by her chief whip before inviting Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders to talks. But before they even made it to the steps of Downing Street she had scuppered any attempts at compromise by ruling out a customs union. It is Labour’s biggest ask - and would infuriate hardline Brexiteers - but is also one of the few plan Bs that could command a majority in Parliament.  Instead - as the clock ticks ever close to crashing out of the EU without a deal - more stalemate beckons. Over the next few days the PM will try to win over the leaders of smaller parties and backbench Labour MPs. But her refusal to even countenance budging on her red lines suggests she is putting the Tory party ahead of the national interest. She has just four days to try to reach agreement. At that point the Government will have to table a fresh motion which - crucially - can be amended by MPs.   Parliament will take control of Brexit with a series of votes on their own alternatives. Pro-EU MPs are expected to demand the Government rules out a no deal, delays Brexit or holds a second referendum. Even though the votes would not be legally binding, it would be politically impossible for the PM to ignore them. With a softer - and delayed - Brexit looking the most likely outcome, perhaps the champagne should have been kept on ice.

Among those who held talks with the PM yesterday were Tory MPs Owen Paterson, Iain Duncan Smith, Mark Francois, Steve Baker, and Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group. Many other MPs who held crisis talks with ministers yesterday criticised the PM for not yielding to break the deadlock.Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “Sadly, these talks are coming far too late and there is no sign the Prime Minister is genuinely willing to compromise.”   Labour’s Hilary Benn, chair of the Commons Brexit Committee, said: “The Government has to rule out no-deal. The Prime Minister needs to change her red lines.” The PM’s spokesman responded: “Clearly, there are some areas we aren’t going to agree on. But the very purpose of the meetings is to find areas where there is some consensus to find a way forward.”No also denied suggestions that the UK could commit to a customs union with the EU – a key Labour demand that has split the Cabinet.Labour leader Mr Corbyn yesterday continued to rebuff Mrs May’s offer to negotiate.Speaking in Hastings, where he visited staff at Conquest Hospital, Mr Corbyn accused her of holding “phoney talks to run down the clock”.  He said:“ If you are serious about reaching a deal, then no deal must be ruled out. Labour is open to meaningful discussions.But following the decisive rejection of the Government’s deal by MPs, those cannot be on the basis of your existing red lines.” If Mrs May ruled out a no-deal exit, it could trigger resignations of hard Brexiteers in her top team. The PM shot down Mr Corbyn’s “impossible condition”.She said: “Do you really believe that, as well as declining to meet for talks yourself, it is right to ask your MPs not to seek a solution with the Government ” Former Labour PM Tony Blair also blasted Mr Corbyn.He said: “If, in a moment of national crisis, the Prime Minister asks the Leader of the Opposition to talk, of course he should.” Mrs May will spend the weekend at Chequers and will update the Commons on Monday. She has axed plans to attend the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. Meanwhile, Tory MP Boris Johnson will today make the latest in a series of thinly veiled leadership bids in a speech at a JCB plant in Staffordshire. He will say the Brexit vote was triggered by a feeling that the British people had been drting too far apart. “If we are to bring our nation together, that means investing in great public services and safer streets, better hospitals, transport links and housing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror its time lame","story":"NewsopinionVoice of The Mirror: Its time lame PM got real and faced the truthTheresa May limps on… still in office but hardly in power as the Brexit shambles continues with no clear end in sightShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsopinionThe enfeebled Prime Minister is plainly not up to the task in hand \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThanks to the DUP, Theresa May limps on… still in office but hardly in power. It is the country’s misfortune that it faces its greatest crisis since the Second World War with an enfeebled Prime Minister who is plainly not up to the task in hand. Having suffered the worst defeat in shyParliamentary history, Mrs May finally did what she should have done when taking office – she reached out to opposition leaders.   Their reticence in accepting this belated olive branch is understandable. The PM has shown no indication she is prepared to compromise on her Brexit plans. Her appeal for MPs to act in the national interest would carry more weight had she not put her own party’s interest first at every stage. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was right to demand taking no-deal off the table as the condition for any talks. Mrs May must show she is ready to make concessions. If she is sincere about wanting progress, she also needs to start showing some humility and realism about her diminished authority.

Mitzi, believed to be around eight-years-old, became an internet sensation after pictures emerged of her at her largest. She has now managed to drop to her lowest weight of .kg - but a healthy cat usually weighs around kg. Mitzi ended up back at Woodside Animal Welfare Trust near Plymouth, Devon, after another change in circumstance for the owner. Staff at the centre today told Plymouth Live the constant to-ing and fro-ing is having a negative impact on the moggy. It is believed Mitzi ballooned to almost twice the weight of a healthy cat after students fed her at dferent addresses across the port city.   But she was unable to find a permanent home. Lisa Darcy, assistant manager at Woodside Animal Welfare Trust, said: Were disappointed she hasnt quite managed to find that match yet but she is so well loved by staff here. We will continue to stand by her and help with her diet. She is still quite barrel looking but we are half way their [to get to a safe weight]. She is a bit of a grumpy girl but with her weight loss and through gaining mobility that could change.   Shes getting a bit fed up of it [coming back]. Shes like great, Im back here again and I think it is impacting her mentally as she cant ever feel completely settled here. She needs a child free home, and shes not keen on other animals either.

We were so in love, great friends and our relationship was very passionate – I thought I’d won the lottery with him. I am a orcee with two young children, but he embraced that and never gave me any hint that taking on my kids, as well as me, was an issue for him. Then, a few weeks ago, he moved out, saying the relationship wasn’t what he’d expected and that being a stepfather doesn’t come naturally to him. He’s admitted he still loves me, but said he’s not ready or able to cope with family le and needs his own space. We did marry quickly – within four months of knowing each other – so it’s been a whirlwind romance and all my friends and family warned me that it was too fast. I’m distraught because I still love him too, and want to try to make it work. What should I do – just throw in the towel or try to fight a bit harder for our marriage  We are still talking and being civil with each other, but he’s made it clear he doesn’t want to move back in. Please help. Coleen says I think you were so caught up in the romance, you let your heart rule your head and didn’t think through what it was going to be like when you were living together as a family.I was in a similar situation when I got together with Ray and he became a stepfather to my two sons, who were just kids at the time. It was hard for him and for them, and it took a good two years before things settled down and we all got used to the new family dynamic. It’s not something that just clicks into place – it can be extremely challenging. Perhapsyou can both acknowledge that fact and accept that it’s going to take effort from all of you then you might have a fighting chance.And maybe once he’s spent some time on his own to think things over, he’ll be in a better place to try again. He says he still loves you and it’s good that you’re talking, so shyrelationship therapy might provide a way forward.I think you’ll almost have to start again – dating, him staying over at your place occasionally, and getting to know each other on a deeper and more honest level.  Dear Coleen I’ve been cheating with a married man for a couple of years. The relationship actually started when my boyfriend and I were taking a break, but then we got back together and, although it was wrong, I kept seeing the other man, too. The guy I’m having the affair with is married but he told me last week that he’s going to tell his we he’s leaving and he wants us to be together properly. Instead of being happy and excited, I went into panic mode because I’m not sure it’s what I want. Although things were rocky with my boyfriend, we’ve been getting along so much better. How do I get out of this mess  I care deeply for both of them and the reality of wrecking a marriage is hitting home. Coleen says I think you need to be on your own for a while to work out what it is you actually want.You’ve put yourself in a stressful situation and you’re not going to be able to think or see clearly while you’re in the middle of it. Tell the man you’re having the affair with that you’re not sure –he’s going to leave his we, it has to be for himself and not for you. Explain you need time out to think things over. As for your boyfriend, how can things be better when you’re still having an affair behind his back  There’s got to be something missing from the relationship. I don’t think he’s the one and I think he deserves better.

Leanne and Darrel Fleck are preparing to mark the year since their son Kayden died at the age of five. The mischievous and fun-loving schoolboy was swept to his death on the Braid River in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. His identical twin brother Jayden was the last person to see him alive after desperately trying to save him. The youngster grabbed at his siblings fingertips as the freezing cold water carried him away. As the family brace themselves for the heartbreaking milestone, an unexpected ray of light has given them the strength. Baby Ellianna, Kayden’s little sister has brought joy to the familys le during their dark time. “We didn’t know she was coming,” Leanne told Belfast Live. “But about three weeks after we lost Kayden, through all the pain and darkness of that time, we discovered I was pregnant.   “It was a huge shock. And more than anything, it was just so bittersweet because we were going through all the emotions of losing Kayden and trying to figure out what way our family was going to go from there. Then suddenly, she came along. “She shone a wee bit of light on our family. We had people telling us it was too soon for us to cope after losing Kayden - but then we had others offering us support as well, and they said she was our wee blessing. And I think she was. “I’m never going to forget Kayden. I’m never going to forget that day. And when the anniversary comes around I don’t know how we’re going to be but at least now we have our baby to focus on. “She’s healthy, she’s here, she’s our wee girl and we will love and care for her like we did Kayden, and our other children.” The morning of that fateful Saturday in February last year started out full of hope and fun. Leanne and Darrel, who had tied the knot just two weeks earlier with their handsome twins as ring bearers, had moved the family from the Ballykeel estate in Ballymena to a new home in Cullybackey with high hopes for the future. That day, they ed to their old house to collect the last of their things. “We got in the car, me and Darrel, the twins and our daughter Amelia, and headed back to Ballykeel,” said Leanne. “Darrel had to clear out the shed, and I wanted to make sure everything was out and that the place was clean and tidy before we handed the keys in.” And it is this detail, as well as every other twist and turn of that time which Leanne continues to pore over and use to torment herself.   “I just wonderwe hadn’t gone back to the house to clear up that day, orwe hadn’t decided to move to Cullybackey at all, would we have lost him ” said Leanne. “Darrel was out sorting the shed and I was in the sitting room when one of the boys came in and said, ‘Can we go out the back ’ Even now I can’t say for sure which of them it was, because I was taking down these old blinds and I just said, ‘OK, but don’t be going away’. “I didn’t even look round to see which one it was and I hate myself for that because I was too busy doing these bits and pieces to look around. “You see they never went anywhere without us. They never went far, and that day I thought they’d be running in and out through the empty house into the back garden but when I went out to put the blinds in the bin, they weren’t there.” When Darrel told Leanne the boys had been in the garden just seconds earlier, the pair headed straight to the boys’ usual stomping ground, a play-park just a stones throw from the house.  But the boys were not there. “Kayden had found p in the car on the way so my next thought was, had they tried to walk to the shop up from the house,” said Leanne.“So we split up to look for them. We didn’t even think to go to the river because they’d never been that direction without us in their lives.” It was Darrel who first became aware just how grave the situation was. He recalled: “I was looking for the boys and then I heard ‘Daddy help, Daddy help’, and there was Jayden coming running across the path. “He was soaked from his neck to his feet. I asked him where Kayden was and he said, ‘He fell in the river Daddy, he fell in the river’.” Young Jayden and his father rushed to the spot Kayden had fallen, at the edge of the Braid River near the Ecos Centre in Ballymena. “I was running up and down the river looking for Kayden, searching for the bright orange jumper he was wearing that day,” said Darrel. A man passing by heard the commotion, and called for help. “They were quick,” said Darrel. “But by the time the police and search and rescue were there, Kayden was long gone.” The schoolboy, a pupil at Harryville Primary School in Ballymena, was pulled from the river four miles away. “Afterwards, Jayden told us he was wet because he’d got into the river to try and catch Kayden,” said Darrel.   “He’d got the tip of his finger, but the current was too strong and he couldn’t hold onto him.” Making sense of the tragedy has been excruciating for the family. Why them and why that day  Why had one son managed to escape the river, while the other had not  “It was awful, we couldn’t make sense of it,” said Leanne, who also has an older son, Daniel, . “But Jayden said he held onto the grass, he clung to it. Kayden couldn’t.” While the boys were identical in almost every way, one huge dference marked the twins apart. From the moment he was born, Kayden was extremely ill. Born with a congenital heart defect, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, he spent the first year of his le in hospital, travelling from Belfast to Birmingham, to Antrim and back undergoing surgery and intensive treatment for his condition. The youngster didn’t step foot in his family home until two days before his first birthday. “We had the biggest party for them, we hired a hall and got them a clown,” recalled Leanne, smiling at the memory. “But that start in le meant Jayden was always that little bit stronger. Kayden had his first open heart surgery when he was  hours old, and the last one less than a year before he died. We’d hoped that one would see him through until he was .” Kayden’s tough start in le only strengthened his bond with his brother, and little Jayden was his right-hand man through it all. “Kayden was taken straight to Birmingham Children’s Hospital the day after he was born,” said Darrel. “Leanne wasn’t allowed to fly because she’d had a caesarean, but I went over with my mum. “On the fourth day, I was able to come back and take Jayden over with me on the flight and when the boys were about a week old a nurse asked meJayden had been in beside his brother yet.   “When I told her no, she took Jayden and set him into the cot beside his brother. Their two wee arms came together, and they held hands. That’s when Kayden started to turn a corner.” After that, says Leanne, the boys were inseparable. And when their sister Amelia came along less than two years later, she got stuck straight in. “She was joined at the hip with Kayden as well,” said Leanne. “Now she says a prayer to him every night when she goes to bed. Even though he was just a toddler when she was born, he loved babies. He’d have loved Ellianna.” And the family are determined the baby, now seven weeks old, will grow up knowing all about her brother.  “I said from day one, from the minute we lost him that he’s always going to be part of our family,” said Leanne. “So we will make sure she knows him.” Complications from Ellianna’s birth meant Leanne spent three days in hospital in the run-up to Christmas, only getting home to her family on Christmas morning. “On the way home, Darrel and me took a drive over to the grave,” she said. “It was hard, knowing Kayden wasn’t there to share it all - the joy of the baby, the joy of Christmas with his family. That’s the hardest part. “People have said to me they find it hard I’m still talking about him after nearly a year, but that’s my way of coping. I talk about him constantly,I’m here by myself I’ll talk to his pictures. If he’s gone five years or , I’ll still talk about him and to him because to me he is still here. “And even though we can’t see him and we can’t hear him he’s going to live on in us, and in the other wee ones. Ellianna will know him. He’s her big brother.” Following the tragedy, the family have called for safety steps around the Braid River to be stepped up. “I just want to make sure this doesnt happen to any other family,” said Leanne. A Mid and East Antrim Borough Council spokesperson said: “Council has erected new barriers and signage along sections of the River Braid. A full water safety survey has also been conducted across Mid and East Antrim’s water sites. Staff regularly inspect paths along river banks to monitor flooding and slippage. “We would urge anyone using paths near rivers to be aware of potential flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall. Council are also launching a water safety campaign later this year to help raise awareness of the dangers of water.” "},{"url":null,"title":"one place prince philip cant","story":"NewsOne place where Prince Philip cant be arrested - no matter what he doesThe Queen is immune from being arrested but it appears that the rest of her family dont have the same luxuryShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a nasty crash \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs Norfolk police investigate a collision involving Prince Philips Land Rover and another vehicle at Babingley, there are some pressing questions that spring to mind. The first - Is the Duke of Edinburgh alright  The second - Can members of the Royal Family even be arrested by the police  Well the answer to the first is thankfully a very good one, as Buckingham Palace have confirmed that he was not injured in the accident. However, the answer to the other question is a little more complicated.   Its well known that The Queen has Sovereign Immunity in the UK, meaning that she can, quite literally, do no wrong. No civil or criminal proceedings can be taken against the Sovereign, but the same rule doesnt apply to any other member of the Royal Family. Therefore, it is the case that the likes of Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Meghan Markle can be arrested - however there are a few loopholes. According to the legal encyclopedia, Halsburys Laws of England, members of the Royal Household cannot be arrested in civil proceedings.   Moreover, theres one very specic place that offers them protection. The encyclopedia states that arrests cannot take place in the presence of the monarch - so as long as they stay by the Queens side, they cant be cuffed by a police officer. This rule also applies to the ious royal palaces across Britain, such as Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace. If a royal is anywhere near a palace, they cannot be taken into police custody.   One royal has already been given a criminal conviction. In , the Princess Royal,Princess Annewas fined pound and made to pay compensation after pleading guilty to a charge of one of her dogs attacking children. She was the first member of the royal family to plead guilty to a criminal offence. The year before this, Anne was also fined pound for speeding in her Bentley after admitting driving at mph in a mph zone in Gloucestershire.

This afternoon Prince Philip was behind the wheel of a Land Rover which overturned after being in a collision near the Queens Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. The -year-old, who was miraculously unharmed, was breath tested at the scene by a Norfolk Police officer and provided a negative reading. Some have questioned the fact the Duke of Edinburgh was still driving, despite his advanced age. On June   Prince Charles told a D-Day veterans son he worried about his dads insistence on still driving a car. The heir-to-the-throne spoke to Ivor Thomas, a former Corporal in the Royal Engineers. Mr Thomass son, Philip told the Prince his father, who was sitting in a wheelchair, still insisted on driving his car, a  Ford Sierra.   So does my father. Im always worried, Charles said, before gesturing towards Mr Thomas, and asking: But his eyesights all right  These apparent concerns did not dissuade the duke from driving Barrack and Michelle Obama to lunch during their visit in April . And earlier last year he was pictured driving at the Royal Windsor Horse Show.The cause of the accident is under investigation, Norfolk Police said.The president of the AA, Edmund King said high profile car crashes involving elderly drivers often spark calls for bans or restrictions on older drivers.   But he added: If driving restrictions based on age and safety were introduced we would be more likely to restrict young drivers rather than older drivers. Young, predominantly male, drivers are much more likely to crash within six months of passing their test than older drivers within six months of hanging up their keys. Older drivers often self restrict their driving by not driving at night and only driving on familiar roads. Norfolk Police said it was force policy to breath test all drivers involved in collisions.   Although the duke and the passenger in the Land Rover, thought to be a close protection officer, were unharmed two women in the other vehicle, a Kia, suffered minor injuries. They have both since been discharged from hospital. The duke is spending the evening at Sandringham with the Queen at his side. The pair have lived there since Christmas although Philip did not attend a church ceremony on Christmas Day. He officially retired from royal duties in August .

Medics fear the prince could be at risk of a subdural haematoma, a bleed on the brain, which can be deadly. Dr Nick Scriven, President of the Society for Acute Medicine, said yesterday: “They will have to keep an eye on him overnight because the risk for this will be over the next  to  hours.” The prince emerged shaken but seemingly physically unscathed from the collision. But Dr Scriven said: “This is not a minor event for a -year-old.” Philip was seen immediately by a doctor at the Sandringham Estate and it was decided he did not need treatment at hospital. But it is possible he will suffer delayed symptoms and experts say because of his age, an accident of this type could have serious consequences.   Dr Scriven said: “Risks in any accident like this are concussion or even a subdural haematoma following a head injury.” A subdural haematoma is where blood collects between the skull and the surface of the brain. Dr Scriven added: “This would especially be a worry in the elderly. If he has had any head injury he will need monitoring for his mental state and alertness. People suffering from subdural haematoma can become confused and sleepy. “He will have people around him I suspect. He may have medical staff who will be with him. If he wasn’t knocked out and there’s no obvious head trauma it is probably OK for him to stay at home and be monitored by the people who know him.”  Subdural haematomas are potentially deadly and can cause seizures, coma, behavioural changes, headaches or vomiting. Dr Scriven said the prince’s age makes it likely that he will take time to bounce back after the “trauma” of the crash. He said : “It doesn’t take much trauma for a very elderly person to lose their confidence. “If he is immobile with bruises it will take a while to regain his strength and fitness because people who are immobile lose their fitness very quickly. “The loss of mobility for a couple of days can take two or three weeks to get back. Then there are risks of infection to any elderly person who is immobile, especiallythey are in pain.”  Ella Clarke-Billings, an AE nurse at King’s College, said: “He could have had an internal bleed, head injuries and whiplash. It depends whether he was wearing a seat belt. If the air-bag was deployed, he could have suffered broken or fractured bones. “Obviously with a person of that age, the recovery times are slower. The stress of the crash would also have more of an impact at that age. They would be more confused, or reach a state they call delirium.” The Duke of Edinburgh has stayed fit and sprightly despite his advancing years. He still insists on walking upstairs when possible, but has faced some health problems, needing hip surgery and suffering repeated bladder infections.   Since his retirement from official solo duties in , he has appeared in public alongside the Queen and other members of the royal family at events and church services. After bowing out of public le Philip was expected to keep busy with his hobbies, including carriage driving, oil painting and bird watching. In November , he and the Queen marked  years of marriage, their platinum anniversary, with a black-tie dinner at Windsor Castle. While Philip attended the Cenotaph remembrance service and the traditional Christmas church service at Sandringham in , he was absent from both events last year. In April  he spent a week-and-a-half in hospital after his hip replacement operation.  Just a month later he attended the wedding of grandson Prince Harry and Meghan Markle . In October  he watched granddaughter Princess Eugenie wed Jack Brooksbank. The Duke of Edinburgh admitted ahead of his th birthday in  that he wanted “less responsibility, less rushing about”. In a BBC interview, Prince Philip said: “I reckon I’ve done my bit, I want to enjoy myself for a bit now. “With less responsibility, less rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say. “On top of that your memory’s going, I can’t remember names. “Yes, I’m just sort of winding down.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince philip dazzled sun before","story":"NewsPrince Philip told cops hed been dazzled by the sun after horric car crashThe Duke of Edinburgh reportedly cried My legs!

Martina Baker, from Maine, USA, sufferers from Mast Cell Activation Syndrome- an immunological condition that makes her allergic to “almost anything”, including heat, water and perfume. Even a whf of cooking oil or bleach could send the teenager into anaphylactic shock, andtreatment isn’t administered right away Martina could die. She’s also highly allergic to marijuana smoke, which poses a dficult issue for the teen, as the drug was recently legalised in her home state.   But now, after raising , , there’s a new hope for Martina as her family have been able to get her a highly-trained assistance dog who could help to save her le. With Caiomhe at her side, Martina was recently able to sit though a movie at a cinema for the first time in years - giving her a new lease of le.   Caiomhe has changed my le, I feel so much safer with her around, I am able to have a social le again, said Martina, who was forced to miss school and stay at home in a sealed room to avoid anaphylactic shocks. I lost a lot of friends after I developed MCAS, its hard for people to handle, for them to watch me collapse and have to take my EpiPen and be rushed to hospital all the time, added Martina, who lives in Wiscasset. It could be very lonely at times, but Caiomhe is always beside me protecting me, shes a best friend for sure. She makes me feel less alone, she even checks up on me in the middle of the night.”  Until two and a half years ago Martina was completely healthy, but overnight she was suddenly overcome by terrying symptoms. I wasnt allergic to anything before, then one day I woke up with hives all over my body. I had to go to the hospital because I had an anaphylactic reaction. My throat started swelling up with hives. They treated me with an EpiPen. The students problems only intensied from there. The hives would flare up all the time, shed go into anaphylactic shock and wed to have to rush her to the ER about three times a week, said Martinas mother Loretta Morse Leighton, , a family therapist. We never knew what was triggering it really.” Last summer a skunk sprayed off outside Martinas bedroom window, she went into anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to AE. Afterwards she had to go and live with a friend for almost two weeks while we had her bedroom windows and door completely sealed up, it was awful, recalled Loretta.  For months doctors had been baffled by Martinas condition. We took her to see a specialist in every major discipline, everything from cardiologists to psychologists, said Loretta, who eventually took Martina to an immunologist in Massachusetts named Jonathan Bayuk, who correctly diagnosed her with MCAS. Thanks to Caiomhe and regular mast cell stabilizing drugs Martinas anaphylactic episodes have reduced from three times a week to once every four to six weeks. Martina often wears a mask when she goes outside and the family still has to be very careful in their home. Loretta cleans with vinegar instead of cleaning products and has stopped using all detergents on sheets and clothing. They must practice odorless cooking and spend a lot of time grilling outside, even in winter. Martina is extremely sensitive to warmth, so her bedroom isnt heated at all, even during the freezing Maine winters.  I dont know how she tolerates the cold, she lives like a penguin in there, laughed Loretta. Last year Loretta discovered that a service dog might help her daughter. Caiomhe was trained by Jamie Robinson, a specialist in Tucson, Arizona - one of the only people in the world to train dogs to assist MCAS patients. Jamie trained Caiomhe to identy a long list of smells that are le-le-threatening triggers for Martina. A dogs nose is about , times better than a human nose and just about every biochemical process in our bodies is indicated with a change in scent, said Jamie, , who runs her own service dog business called Access to Service Corp.  Jamie had Martina send her pieces of clothing she had worn so Caiomhe could get used to her scent, including when she was in anaphylaxis because, to a dog, that scent is dferent. Caiomhe can now snf out when Martina is having a reaction before Martina realizes it, because she can smell the release of histamine from her body. Martina and three-year-old Caiomhe were first united on January  and have been inseparable ever since. Martina has endured a lot of staring, pointing and rude remarks etc, people do not understand, its very dficult for her but shes stayed extremely strong, Im so proud of her, said Loretta. I feel that Caiomhe was destined to be my daughtersangel. In the pictures of Martina now with Caiomhe, I see joy, light and le. A spark that has been missing and robbed from her since this awful disease has taken ahold of her. Caiomhe brought that back to her in a new, wonderful and amazing way.” From more information on MCAS visit: https:tmsforacure.org symptoms symptoms-and-triggers-of-mast-cell-activation  "},{"url":null,"title":"dad finds secret cameras airbnb","story":"NewsDad finds secret cameras in Airbnb rental - but is told he consented to itJeffrey Bigham found one camera in the living room of the property and another near the bathroom doorShareCommentsByLuke Kenton:,  JAN NewsJeff Bigham had been staying at the property with his family during a winter break \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad-of-three discovered two hidden cameras inside his Airbnb apartment - with one allegedly positioned facing the bathroom door. During a family trip over the New Year’s period, computer science professor Jeffrey Bigham found two small white cameras in separate rooms of the rented property. In a blog post, Bigham revealed the host had initially disclosed the camera’s presence at the property, but they werent positioned “near the entrance” as listed on the room-sharing app. He found one camera in the corner of the living room during his family’s second day at the property.   Bigham later found a second device positioned where he claims the bathroom door would have been in-shot. He immediately unplugged them both and reached out to Airbnb to complain. The father told the company he never gave consent to being filmed at the residence, nor was he aware of the cameras at the time of booking. However, Mr. Bigham was left stunned when Airbnb sided with the apartment owner, saying the cameras had been disclosed in a picture of the listing, where a small white object in the corner of the photo can be seen. When my family and I stayed in an AirBnB this past winter break, we discovered this camera and another about a day into our stay, Bigham said in a post. I was shocked, and immediately unplugged them. I don’t think we did anything particularly weird in front of that camera, but it’s very likely that my -year-old ran in front of this camera naked . I looked at the home guide again, and it did say that there were cameras at the entrance, which these cameras clearly were not. I contacted AirBnB about it, and long story short they said the single photo above was proper disclosure of both cameras.

The pilot had made clear he was prepared to make an emergency landing after the violent passenger attacked people around him. The man - aged  and reportedly recently released from prison in Thailand - went on a rampage on the A flight from Bangkok. Video shows the man tied with sticky tape and belts on the floor of the aircraft’s galley. Passengers “neutralised” him after stewardesses were unable to calm him - and he was tied on the floor of the jet for some four hours until the plane reached Russia.   A male passenger “hit the hooligan several times and with the help of other tourists tied him up”, said Colonel Irina Volk, spokeswoman for the Russian Interior Ministry. “Witnesses confirmed that the captain had warned passengers that they might need to land in China or Mongolia because of this hooligan”. The shocking air rage incident was on a packed alcohol-free flight from Bangkok to Russia’s third largest city Novosibirsk, operated by S, part of the same One World alliance as British Airways and American Airlines.  Some  were on board including babies and young children. The abusive passenger had been drinking whisky from a bottle he carried on board - and started “offensive and threatening behaviour” three hours into the seven hour  minute flight, according to witnesses.   Passenger Pavel Makarov posted: “I spotted him at the beginning of the fight – with a half empty whisky bottle and behaving strangely.” Four hours into the flight, the captain intervened, he said. “There were three ways out under international aviation rules - one, the hooligan calms down. “Two, we continue flying and give the guy away to police on arrival. “Three, the plane lands in China or Mongolia and we sort it out on the ground.”  But he said: “The abuser got more and more wild and finally passengers neutralised him “They tied him with sticky tape and belts.” The man was “hurt a bit” and was given medical attention while tied up. After landing in Novosibirsk, he man was taken away by transport police. S - Russia’s second largest airline after Aeroflot - confirmed the incident from January .  “The passenger behaved in inadequate way during the flight,” said a spokesperson. “He was drinking alcohol, disturbed other passengers and did not react to orders from the crew. “For the sake of security, stewardesses have called the hooligan to the galley in the rear of the plane and tried to calm him down. “But he began to wave his arms, to threaten and abuse the crew and passengers. “  “During the rest of the flight he was closely watched by one of the stewards and a doctor - one of the passengers. “As a result of this incident, there were no delays. “On arrival to Novosibirsk the hooligan was given away to airport police department where he was charged with hooliganism.” It is understood the man was later fined.

A random farmer that neither of us knew even bought us shots of whisky.“I was living in Glasgow while completing my studies so, following that date, Martin was smitten and would visit me most weekends.“We did the long-distance relationship for about a year before I graduated and got a job down in County Durham. Martin followed me, leaving his job and his home and got a job in Middlesbrough.“I still wouldn’t let him move in with me though until about three months later when I realised it really was silly to still be living apart.”In September  sunnier climes called and Martin and Katie were heading to Majorca.However, much to the annoyance of Katie, Martin seemed to be in no rush to pack.Katie said: “I had been asking Martin to look out all the clothes he wanted to take for ages but he never did it so one day I went in to his room and started getting all his T-shirts organised myself.“It was all in a mess and Martin has always got receipts lying about the place so I grabbed them thinking they would be work expenses and quickly realised that one was actually for a ring.“I didn’t know what to do but I couldn’t put everything back in the drawer the same mess that it was so Martin obviously knew I had seen it.”Martin, a service engineer, added: “On the first night of the holiday I said to Katie ‘I know that you know I have got a ring’, so it did make it a bit easier when it was time to ask.“I had the ring for six months before I did ask and occasions kept passing me by and I wouldn’t have done it.”On the second night of their break Martin enlisted the help of nephew Ruan who was one at the time. Martin wrote a letter which Ruan passed to his Aunty Katie.Ruan was three by the time Martin and Katie got married on October  at Fernie Castle in Fe. He had the special job of announcing to the waiting guests that the bride was on her way with a sign that read: “Here comes Aunty Katie, and it’s all thanks to me.”But he wasn’t the only cute attendee to steal the show – Martin and Katie’s four-legged friends Morgan and Talisker also made special guest appearances.However, Morgan was more focused on the chickens which roam the venue than the formal proceedings.Martin first laid eyes on his bride during a “first look” which involved him sitting blindfolded. When the blindfold was removed, his bride was in front of him.Katie added: “It was lovely doing the first look. Our amazing photographer Chris Scott captured every reaction and then he left us for  minutes all by ourselves which you don’t really get at any other point on your wedding day.“We gave each other little cards that we had written too.”It wasn’t the only romantic part before the ‘I dos’ were said though, as Martin had pulled out all the stops to give Katie a bracelet for the day which had originally been gted to her grandmother on her wedding day by Katie’s grandad who died in .Katie said: “I am not an emotional person but Martin on the other hand is a crier.“But I definitely got choked up when he gave me the bracelet. It was incredibly thoughtful.”Following the laid-back morning and ceremony, Martin and Katie cut their magnicent cheese wedding cake from The Cheesery. Well, they attempted to anyway, using a blunt sword which saw the miniature groom fall off and lose his head.They danced to Soldier by Gavin DeGraw for their first sway as a married couple before enjoying the rest of their reception.Katie added: “Neil at Fernie Castle was amazing and we knew we loved the venue from the moment we walked in.“We want to say a massive thank you to all of our family and friends who made the day laidback but filled with fun and laughter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united director tony asghar says slightly different men can achieve promotion","story":"New Dundee United sporting director Tony Asghar believes, together with manager Robbie Neilson, they can recruit the right players to deliver promotion from the Championship.Asghar’s newly-created role comes after he helped millionaire US owner Mark Ogren broker a deal to take the reins at Tannadice and will see him head up the football side of the club, dealing primarily with long-term recruitment, player development and on-pitch performance.The former police officer, agent and consultant will work closely with United boss Robbie as they aim toto the Premiership at the third time of asking at the end of the season.“The first business plan is only in the short term and that goal is to attain promotion,” he said.“The club itself is a huge club, I think the new owners want to invest in that and get the club back to the Premiership.“Always when a takeover happens just during the January window it’s a bit frantic but we’re trying to stay calm and assess the squad to bring in new players that fit the long-term recruitment strategy for this club.“We’ll be taking a deep breath on February  after the transfer window has closed but short term we really need to attain promotion. That’s our key aim.”And Asghar insists they will be looking for a ‘dferent’ kind of player, assessing their character as well as playing ability.He added: “We will have a way of trying to identy players and I think you’ve seen over the last few players we’ve brought in, they’re slightly dferent, slightly younger with the exception of Morgaro Gomis.“That will be our strategy moving forward, good quality young players who can make this team successful.“I think with our strategy we’re going to try to take a deep breath, try to assist the head coach and develop our players.“It doesn’t mean just throwing money at it willy nilly, we have to be strategic and understand the character of the players, which is not done a lot. There are good players that the other managers that have been here have brought in.“We’ll assess all that, see who is part of what we want going forward,they’re going to buy into what we’re doing and, hopefully, we’ll have a successful conclusion.”Although he will help Robbie identy and develop players as sellable assets, it will be the gaffer who will always have the final say on first-team matters.Asghar added: “I’ll be based at Tannadice, the training ground and part of my remit is also to go and carry out recruitment.“I’m not going to be at the training ground, standing every day, I wasn’t a professional player or a manager so I don’t think there’s any benefit there.“I think there is benefit where I can aide small things that are going to help the team going forward.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c3dee016491b9.33373019.jpg ","title":"dundee united expect sam stanton to make montrose cup tie","story":"Dundee United boss Robbie Neilson expects midfielder Sam Stanton to be fit for Saturday’s Scottish Cup trip to Montrose.But full-back Stewart Murdoch is a doubt after being replaced by Paul Watson having picked up a knock in the second half of Saturday’s victory over Dunfermline at Tannadice.And by the end of the  minutes, Stanton was limping heavily. Robbie, though, is confident he will make his squad for the Links Park excursion.“Murdoch had a wee problem with his knee. He tried to play on with it but couldn’t,# said the manager.“Stanton is OK, he was just tight.

At Leisure and Culture Dundee, there are experts and facilities that can help you make the positive changes you need to take up the healthier lestyle you crave. Tele features writer Amy Hall is showcasing some of the things on offer from the city-based operator of leisure centres and gyms – from fitness classes to weightlting and even the swimming pool. This time, Amy is pumping iron with fitness trainer David Low at the Douglas Sports Centre.I feel like a champion lter, evenI only managed to lt the bar without any heavy weights on it.Girls’ weightlting has experienced a massive increase in popularity lately and it is easy to see why when you give it a go.I headed to Douglas Sports Centre – which has recently seen an improvement in its free-weight facilities – and met fitness instructor David Low, who was going to put me through my weight workout.We started with a warm-up on the rowing machine, with David on hand to push me through my -second sets.He assured me the rowing machine was the best for an all-over-body warm-up, which is definitely needed before pumping iron. vw, px\"  We then headed through to the weights section and although it seemed daunting at first, David was there to talk me through techniques using the weighted bar, hand weights and my own body weight to work on biceps and triceps.David developed a workout which used a , , nine, approach which saw three dferent workouts put together for a really tough but enjoyable challenge.First I completed  squats with a weight, then  dead lts using the weight bar before finishing off with nine overhead lts using the hand weights.By the end, my arms felt like I had slept on them and had gone completely dead – which is apparently a good thing and totally normal.My legs had turned to jelly but I genuinely felt really good about what I had managed to do.I never lt anything heavy and had always thought of myself as a bit of a weakling but the workout David had me do showed that this can be adapted to any capability and it is definitely an addictive sport. vw, px\"  David explained all of the benefits of weightlting, saying: “With strength training, the aim is to perform compound movements like a squat, a deadlt or an overhead press to target the largest muscles in the body and get maximum benefit from lting weights.“These types of exercises use more than one muscle at a time and therefore maximise your time in the gym.“Sessions can then finish with accessory work like bicep curls and tricep dips to target specic areas of the body, depending on what your goal is.“Lting weights is beneficial for absolutely everyone and goes way beyond helping you look better.“It can assist with weight management, increase sports performance, improve mental health and help control or prevent a wide range of medical conditions.“The aim is to always start with correct form and coaching, learn the basics and then increase intensity at your pace.”Find out more at the Leisure and Culture Dundee website."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c3dee142315e3.60120202.jpg ","title":"tom duthie dundee united need to sign another out and out striker","story":"Two of the three signings Dundee United have made in this transfer window, as manager Robbie Neilson looks to add the quality he feels he needs to win automatic promotion, have been attack-minded in the shape of Aidan Nesbitt and Cammy Smith.And it should come as no surprise the manager will continue to work to bolster his attack between now an the end of the month by adding another central striker to his options.Although the Tangerines’ narrow victory over Dunfermline last weekend saw them close the gap to Championship leaders Ross County to just three points, not lost on Neilson will be the fact the three points taken from the Pars clash was only his team’s second win in their last seven.During that run, only once have United, in the pre-Christmas victory over Falkirk, scored more than a single goal, highlighting the need for a player to be found who can provide a more frequent goal supply than has been forthcoming of late.If Nicky Clark, the man who got the weekend winner against one of his former clubs, stays fit, it’s fair to assume he will hit the back of the net frequently.A proven scorer, particularly at this level, hisof six goals in  appearances since joining up in the summer represents a pretty decent goals-to-game ratio.The issue for the -year-old has been getting on the pitch.Injury problems mean he has missed almost half the games so far andyou take into account the number of times when, like last Saturday, he’s only been fit enough for the bench, more than half United’s game time this season has been without him.As well as reduce the goal threat, his absences have given the manager a tactical headache.Since early on in his time in charge, Neilson has said he would like to be able to go with the option of playing two out-and-out central strikers.More often than not, though, on-loan Pavol Safranko has had to be used in that role on his own.And as much as his admirable work ethic has made the Slovakian a firm favourite with both gaffer and fans, his promising start at Tannadice, in terms of goals, has now faded. That’s a worry.Seven goals in his first  games after arriving from Danes Aalborg in August suggested the man to get the goals to fire them to promotion had been found.The last seven games, with just one strike to his credit, have dampened such expectations.And while that work he puts in when up front, often on his own, means he continues to be a vital cog in the wheel for the team, there is little question he’d benefit from a regular strike partner.Of course, the arrival of Nesbitt and Smith should help ease the burden on whoever is right up front but only to a degree.Both are capable of chipping in with goals but a good chunk of the work they do is likely to be in creating chances as opposed to taking them.Putting more goals in the team would also ease the pressure on the defence.While the back four have been leaking too many goals this season, they’ve too often taken to the pitch knowing the loss of just one goal may well see a point or points dropped.That’s why the next couple of weeks will see Neilson, presumably backed by new owner Mark Ogren’s money, pull out all the stops to find another quality striker.Particularly in this transfer window, that’s usually easier said than done.If he succeeds and United are back in the top flight come the end of the season it would have been well worth the effort."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c051af07378a-e1543840266799-940x555.jpg ","title":"tom duthie scottish football should never allow merger of dundees clubs","story":"The latest outbreak of merger fever in Dundee was no more than another in a long list of  alarms among the city’s football public.It’s not unlike the hypochondriac who catches a cold and immediately thinks he’s gone down with pneumonia.The revelation Dundee owner Tim Keyes wants to increase his shareholding to over % and remove the right of the club’s supporters’ society to veto any merger with neighbours United, had temperatures running high.With another American, Mark Ogren, now in control at Tannadice, fans of both clubs had been examining the “symptoms” and reached the diagnosis that a coming together was desired.That shows the accusation the media never let the facts get in the way of a good story can also, sometimes, be levelled at supporters.All along a forensic examination of the timeline of those symptoms strongly suggested this had everything to do with Keyes wanting to be able to build his new stadium at Camperdown without having to get the go-ahead from the fans’ group.Moving away from Dens is another on the list of protected items they can block and,Keyes is going to spend millions on “Nou Campie”, it’s not stretching the imagination to see why he might not want to need permission from a group that won’t be asked to inject a penny.More signicant is the fact Dundee first raised the matter months ago – before Ogren was on the scene at United. Even though this was a case of putting two and two together and getting five, it shows, despite merger being mooted and quickly dismissed on numerous occasions down the decades, it remains a worrying subject for the fans.And while those further afield may see a lot of sense in a one-club city, for those punters who actually turn up at Dens and Tannadice, it is the nightmare scenario. They’ll take hard times like financial crisis and relegation and stick with their team but what they’d never do is watch a merged team.That alone is why such a move is too dangerous. The clubs should always take the “nos” of the fans who go to games over the “I woulds” of potential new customers of a ‘Dundee City’.There is every chance a build-it-and-they-will-come merger would leave us with a club only slightly bigger than the two that exist.That wouldn’t just be bad for the city but Scottish football and it makes it surprising that, when the topic is raised, no one at the top of the game has come out against it.While sporting performance is rightly the normal criteria for the make-up of our top ision,ever it was to be done on size of club, Dundee and United would be in there – and comfortably so.If Premiership membership was decided on that second basis the top  would be something like Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Dundee United, Dundee, Motherwell, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Falkirk and St Mirren.The likes of Morton, Dunfermline and Inverness may argue they should be in there but it would be on the basis they have more potential than the names at the end of that list.When it comes to core support, the first seven clubs listed are untouchable. If Glasgow giants Rangers or Celtic, on their own, are bigger than the rest put together, those from the country’s three other major cities are also well ahead of the others below them.To reiterate, in all but exceptional circumstances, results should determine who’s in the top league, so it’s up to the likes of United to get back there by winning matches.But when the Tangerines and the Dark Blues are in the top flight, Scottish football is the better for it.That will always be the case."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-andy-murray-from-dunblane-to-double-olympic-champion","story":"FROM gangly, wild-haired teenager to one of Britainrsquos great sporting heroes, Sir Andy Murray may have been forced to hang up his rackets but his impact will be felt for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref-2-statement-in-matter-of-weeks-says-nicola-sturgeon","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said she will speak about the timing of a second independence referendum in a ldquomatter of weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"straight-talking-damien-duff-ready-to-make-his-coaching-mark-at-celtic","story":"Damian Duff has conceded that one of his failings is a tendency to curse too much but the former Republic of Ireland internationalist is sworn to getting the best out of those in the underbelly at Celtic."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-keeping-tabs-on-scott-mctominay-situation-as-united-ponder-loan-move-for-midfielder","story":"Celtic are keeping tabs on Scott McTominays situation with Manchester United prepared for the midfielder to go out on a possible loan move before the closure of the transfer window.

bonnet could be first of its kind","story":"COULD this curious looking head-gear be the worldrsquos earliest surviving example of a Glengarry-style bonnet once worn by Highlander clansmen after the act of Proscription banned Highland dress That is the belief of relentless researcher Robert Harbord who is spurring-on staff at Inverness Museum to help solve the mystery.Being Oxford-based and an avid Highland visitor, Mr Harbord is perplexed by the bonnet which nestles inconspicuously behind glass in a cabinet in the museum building.And his task in hand is no mean feat: He wants to track down the inidual who unearthed it more than  years ago ndash or at least speak to one of their surviving relatives.Because he believes the bonnet is unique.He said: ldquoDespite their very best efforts, and their best record-keeping going back to , Inverness Museum does not have any other information on this particular item other than it was found in a peat bog in Fort Augustus pre-s.\"Its origins are a complete mystery.ldquoMy hope is that an article in the Courier might stimulate someone who does know more about its origins to come forward.Research shows bonnets in the lead up to the Battle of Culloden were knitted affairs, large, wide and flat.Insight into the crucial role they once played has been handed down by many historical sources but none so colourfully than the thcentury government roads contractor Edmund Burt who was sent to Inverness from London in the s.Remarking upon the Highlanderrsquos hardened stance to the wet weather in his letters to a friend, Burt, in his book Letters from the North of Scotland said their bonnets were ldquofrequently taken off and wrung like a dish-clout, and then put back on again.Mr Harbord said his research suggests that following the Act of Proscription in  banning Highland dress, clansmen pushed the sides of their bonnets upwards \"and at a stroke created an entirely new shape of bonnet\".And he strongly suspects that the Glengarry-style bonnet in Inverness Museum could be the earliest surviving example.He added: ldquoWhile the word bonnet was not actually mentioned in the Act, it can well be imagined that a clansman from Glen Garry, travelling to the strategically sited Fort Augustus six miles away, might think thathe was spotted by an Army patrol wearing a Highlanderrsquos traditional flat blue bonnet, he could very well be arrested, and jailed for six months, on the spot.Museum curator xxx apologies her name is in the caption of the pictures xxx said no information exists to argue otherwise.She said: ldquoWe think that it came to us before .

A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"joan and jimmy brave the loony dook","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ardrishaig mother started off the new year by braving the freezing temperatures of the South Queensferry Loony Dook in aid of the unit that saved her two daughters born prematurely.In a move that made spectators shiver in their boots, Joan Williamson ran into the Forth from the shores by the Queenferry Crossing road bridge with her son Jimmy to raise money for the Simpsons Special Care Babies Unit at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.After an emergency Caesarean section delivered her two daughters, Star and Angel, two months prematurely, Joan and the girls were left in a bad way.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13865741.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS172700549.jpg","title":"brexit conservative remainer mp admits","story":"NewsBrexit: Conservative Remainer MP admits he would consider voting Leave in second referendumBill Grant says \"arrogance\" from EU negotiators may push him towards voting Leaveany second referendum arose.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsBill Grant MP \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Scots Tory MP says he would consider performing a Brexit u-turnBritain goes back to the polls.

Tory group leader Martin Dowey made the plea for the area to be more car-friendly following the announcement of the closure of Hourstons last week. Councillor Dowey urged the council to ease parking charges in the High Street in a bid to encourage more footfall to the area. Speaking at Seafield, Fort and Wallacetown Community Council last Wednesday, he said: “I am frustrated and saddened at Hourstons closing. “Given the retail climate, it wasn’t unexpected.” The councillor said internet and retail park shopping had contributed to the demise of town centres across the country. “Town centre shops need to be smaller and more niche,” he added. “The town centre is far too big for the size of Ayr.   “We need to utilise what we have got to encourage footfall.” SNP ward councillor Siobhian Brown is disappointed that the iconic store is to close and said a long-term plan is needed to attract more people back to the town centre. “It is a sign of times as people buy online,” she added. Norman McLean, the community council’s chairman, said: “It didn’t get the footfall. It was only a couple of months ago I was in the store and I felt like I was the only person there. “Has the council got any contingency plans  “What about waiving the cost of the first hour parking at parking meters ” The meeting heard that Hourstons were paying pound, per year in business rates before they started paying staff and other costs. Now the iconic building could be turned into flats or used by the council for offices.   Councillor Dowey added: “We need more parking and we have to bring cars back into the High Street. “The one-way system brought in the s was probably a good idea then but it is not such a good idea now. “People don’t drive down the High Street as much any more and they don’t see how bad the bottom end is. “I am guilty as anyone because I go to Heathfield for shopping because you can get parking there.” One community councillor said more must be done to attract sport and culture to the town centre to get people back there. “Retail cannot be sustained,” he insisted. “We need cultural tourism to do draw people into the town centre.” Another pointed out that shops in Prestwick and Troon are thriving: “The dference between Prestwick and Ayr is that they have all small units and in Ayr it is all big High Street units for the past  or  years. Big units cost too much.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"sleazy pensioner took pictures schoolgirls","story":"NewsSleazy pensioner took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirtsA court ruled there was ‘a substantial sexual element to his breach of the peace offence, writes Edwin Lawrence.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  JAN NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sleazy retired architect took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirts. And a court ruled there was ‘a substantial sexual element to his breach of the peace offence. Ross McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour. But Sherf John Montgomery told him: “Your defence is absurd . ‘It wasn’t me. It wasn’t my car’. “There is overwhelming evidence it WAS you, in YOUR car. You’re guilty all day long.” The sherf heard evidence from neighbours in Ayr’s Peggieshill Road who saw McKay in a four-wheel drive vehicle near Belmont Academy. Gary Cornelius, , saw McKay taking sneak pictures with his phone – every time schoolgirls walked by. He took a note of the car’s registration number and called the police. Mr Cornelius said: “It was obvious he was taking photos of every single girl who passed.” This incident occurred in mid  – and Mr Cornelius was shocked to see McKay’s vehicle outside his house again, on March , . Neighbour Paul Cunningham, , also identied McKay on this occasion. Mr Cornelius went to the school where he told a police officer what he had witnessed. Police later seized McKay’s phone and found images of schoolgirls in miniskirts. McKay admitted it was his phone but said he had not taken the pictures. He claimed: “I am aware of a client, just before I retired, who could have done this.” Sherf Montgomery asked: “You mean someone who didn’t like you put them there.” “Yes, but I can’t substantiate it,” replied McKay. “So, it’s a frame-up job – that’s your position ” asked depute fiscal Ed Sheeran. Someone’s in a car with the same registration as yours  Is Mr Cornelius in on the fit-up  Is Mr Cunningham  That’s thoroughly ridiculous,” Mr Sheeran concluded. McKay acknowledged driving in Peggieshill Road on March  but insisted he never stopped or took the pictures. He said he was on his was from the Ayrshire Archives at Auchincruive and the Tesco Express in Ayr’s Maybole Road. Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane pointed to ‘a degree of doubt’ over identication and dates. But after hearing the trial, Sherf Montgomery was in no doubt that McKay was guilty.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

of what they put in.Mrs Bell was keen for social housing and bungalows to be included within the development.She noted concerns had also been expressed about how the townrsquos infrastructure, such as medical centre and primary school, would cope with further expansion, as well as fears it would lead to wildle, such as deer, being displaced and even killed on neighbouring roads.More detailed plans for the site are expected to be revealed at the consultation event.Ward councillor Norman Hampshire said ldquoone or two issues still needed to be dealt with, including the potential road layout, as

There was a baby in the back and, with another man, we got the baby out.ldquoThen I went to the black car to help and realised it was the Duke of Edinburgh.AskedPhilip was trapped, Mr Warne said: ldquoYes, he was. I asked him to move his left leg and that freed his right leg and then I helped him get out.When questioned about what the duke said, he replied: ldquoI canrsquot remember, but it was nothing rude.ldquoHe was obviously shaken, and then he went and askedeveryone  was all right.Mr Warne said the duke was able to stand and walk immediately after getting out of the car, but he appeared to suggest the duke may have been cut, possibly by broken glass.ldquoThere was a little bit of blood and one of the royal entourage gave me a wipe to wipe my hands, he said.Buckingham Palace has said that after the accident the duke ldquosaw a doctor as a precaution and the doctor confirmed he was not injured.Commenting on the circumstances of the crash, Mr Warne added: ldquoI think therersquos no doubt that it was hit .

But what a pity that title has been taken. Those three little words perfectly sum up the drama of Mary Stuartrsquos ill-omened le, from the day of her birth, to her execution. Rourke, like countless historians, novelists and filmmakers before her, shapes the story as a duel between the Scottish queen and her implacable English ldquosister Queen Elizabeth. As the years pass and the Virgin Queenrsquos face becomes a gargoyle of white paint and crimson lipstick ndash Mary remaining a fresh-faced beauty ndash itrsquos not hard to see where the directorrsquos loyalties lie.So far, so predictable. As is the scene where the monarchs meet, an encounter which in real le Elizabeth studiously avoided. Even so, in these days of Angela Merkel, Nicola Sturgeon, Theresa May, and their ilk, Mary and Elizabethrsquos struggle to win and hold respect and allegiance as rulers amid a rabble of scornful males carries an eerie echo in our own times.Fascination with Mary, of course, has nothing to do with her relevance. Her allure is timeless. Save for Jesus of Nazareth and Shakespeare, there cannot be many about whom more films have been made or books written. And trust me, said she putting her hand up, others are in the pipeline.Irsquove sometimes wondered, though, what Scotland would have been likeMary had stayed in France, and refused toas queen. The Dauphin, who became King of France the year after they married, lasted only a few months as Francis II before dying. Mary was only . Buthe had been instead a robust young man who went on to enjoy a long reign over one of Europersquos pre-eminent nations, what then for Scotland Read more: Should Mary be played by a Scots actress In those circumstances, it would surely have been unthinkable for Mary toalone to her native land, to carry out her duties. She might have asked Francis, King Consort of Scotland, to accompany her home every now and then, to remind folk who she was. But because he could not have left his court except briefly and she, as mother of his children, could not have been absent from his side for long either, it would have been no more than a gesture.So how would events have unfoldedwe had continued to be ruled in absentia by a Regent, and Mary had remained in the beautul palace of Fontainebleau in the Isle de France  Evenshe had been widowed, and remarried, she would have had no compelling reason to choose Lord Darnley, and her child would not have been James VI. If nothing , a dferent heir allows for the possibility that a less paranoid inidual might not have lit the fuse of pernicious witchhunts that devastated the country. But while that danger might have been averted, he or she might, unlike James, have held to their motherrsquos Catholic beliefs. In that case, it would have been bloody.Alternative history is the stuff of sleepless nights. Untie a single factual knot, and a vast number of possibilities spills out before you like marbles loosed from their net. Itrsquos not an intellectual game I often indulge in, but in the case of Mary, itrsquos hard to resist. After all, she has made an indelible impression on the way we see ourselves, often without us being aware. Thoughtlessly, even complacently, we take her contribution absolutely for granted. Yet things might so easily have gone in another direction completely.Maryrsquos poor judgment and self-deceit, not to mention her likely treachery and collusion in murder, continue to be felt today. Without her unwise use of power, engrained suspicion of womenrsquos ability to hold high office might have faded sooner. Between Maryrsquos missteps and her sonrsquos hysteria over witches, womenrsquos reputation was blackened indelibly for centuries. Whether it was in the husbands she chose, the friends and political allegiances she made, or the panicked and ill thought- out decisions about her own best interests and those of her people, she was anything but a good role model for modern women. She also played on her feminine charms, even though she was as intelligent and smart as the men around her, and often a great deal more so.Above all, she cemented the countryrsquos reputation as a romantic but backward and violent place. On one hand, she left a legacy of glamour, wit and courage. On the other, she has helped us remain mired in ignorant prejudice. Thanks to her tragic charisma, even now many of us prefer ndash as does this latest film ndash to sensationalise the facts, rather than simply face them."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9296053.jpg?type=article-full","title":"edinburgh-firms-to-meet-ahead-of-george-street-revamp-decision","story":"The City of Edinburgh Councils revamp of George Street the New Town that includes a reduction of cars, wider pavements, trees but less clutter, seating areas, and cycleways follows a series of plans over the past two decades that included incarnations such as a particularly unloved rising bollards restriction and street gazebos that struggled to maintain an anchor in the Scottish gusts, even with diners inside.Consultancy WYG, which won the civilian engineering support team contract to back up the Royal Engineers in construction, management and maintaining the infrastructure throughout Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, the massive former airbase now known as Camp Shorabak, was appointed to draw up a new permanent plan for the area surrounding the grand centrepiece providing cafe culture and better shopping and lestyle experience.So far, the plan has received a cautious welcome from the representatives of business groups and other organisations on the street that runs parallel to Rose Street and Princes Street.Read more:Mike Russell calls on UK Government to rule out a no-deal exit from EU now and foreverCastle Street, Frederick Street and Hanover Street, as well as Charlotte and St Andrew Squares are included in the spruce-up.William Duncan, chairman of the George Street Association, said its membership, which includes firms, residents and organisations like the Royal Society of Edinburgh, isreserving judgement on whether the plan will operate with military precision.He said: \"Yes, we want it to look good but how operationally is it going to work because people are running businesses, hotels, offices, there is also residential accommodation and they need services, they need access and how that will all integrate into the transport plans is something we really donrsquot know as yet.\"Read more:Edinburgh office rents to reach all-time highHe added: \"My impression is reasonably good so far but holding that position until we know what the operational implications are because itrsquos not just a street thatrsquos got to look good itrsquos a street thatrsquos got to work.\"He said members will meet in the new year ahead of the consultation closing date, January .This will include \"the traders, they are an important group and large in number but you have also got hotels and the Freemasonsrsquo Hall and Northern Lighthouse Board and Royal Society of Edinburgh so it is a broad mix of organisations, not all businesses, but they all have toout of George Street\".Carina Contini, owner of Contini George Street restaurant, welcomed the proposal to revitalise the avenue, where the firm has had premises for  years.She said: \"Clearly, it represents a good opportunity for the restaurant to expand the outside dining offering, which is a signicant part of the business during the festivals and throughout the summer months.A matter of yards away, the next street, the pedestrianised Rose Street, is not directly included in the New Town revamp.Jeweller Alistir Wood Tait, in the street  years, said: \"The huge complaint I have here in Rose Street is the mono-block surface that was laid in the seventies has been so neglected that it is not fit for purpose.\"Irsquove got two empty shops opposite me, one of which has been empty for at least five years and the shop next to me is closing in six months time.\"The council say they donrsquot have the money to spend but obviously they have money to spend on other projects.\"Read more:Canongate student flats planThe council said it has worked closely with inidual firms and groups across the city centre.It said key themes emerging from businesses in the area are a strong desire for a very high quality public realm that reflects the \"grandeur of the streets, the need to allow for business servicing, and to cater for a wide range of customer access into the area, including retaining some parking\".Lesley Macinnes, council transport convener, above, said: \"Since its inception, our project to develop a long-term vision for George Street and the First New Town has had local businesses at its core -

Telling the real le story of what happened when a group of teenage asylum seekers and their mates who dubbed themselves the Glasgow Girls took on the system and won, the show itself feels like it has grown stronger in the face of encroaching adversity since it was originally seen at the Citizens Theatre in co-production with the National Theatre of Scotland.Revived for a timely tour by an alliance between increasingly signicant production house Raw Material and gig promoters Regular Music, Bissettrsquos production now feels more intimate somehow as well as more urgent.

That process is likely to take two years to complete.As that means anyone receiving an equal-pay settlement in the coming months would continue to be paid under the discredited system for some time afterwards, it is expected that a further settlement will be negotiated further down the line to cover the period between the initial payout being made and the new pay structure coming into force."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9299759.jpg?type=article-full","title":"date-set-for-mps-to-debate-governments-plan-b-brexit-plan","story":"In the wake of the defeat, opposition parties called on the Government to take a no-deal Brexit off the table in a bid to work cross-party on a way forward but Mrs Leadsom said that was \"not possible\".The Cabinet minister told MPs that removing no deal as an option would be \"an incompetent thing to do\".:Nicola Sturgeon wont waste time talking to May unless PM moves on BrexitMrs Leadsom, speaking at Business questions in the Commons, said: \"Having passed the EUAct, it is the case that the legal default is that the UK will leave the European Union on March , anda deal has not been voted for then it will be with no deal unless other alternative arrangements are put in place.\"The people have spoken and it is our job to fulfil in line with the requirements of the people, this House is a servant of the people of this country, the entire United Kingdom.\"She later added: \"If you take no deal off the table and you stop preparing for no deal, then for a sensible Government that would be totally an incompetent thing to do.\"Government has to continue to prepare for all eventualities including no deal, it is not possible to remove no deal from the table and still abide by the will of the people as expressed in the referendum.\"The rebuttal came after shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz asked Mrs Leadsomthe Government would consider extending Article .:Alison Rowat: How Brexit may yet turn into the Beast from the EastMs Vaz used Business questions to highlight the Governments record-breaking run, and said: \"This is the first Government to be held in contempt of Parliament, the Prime Minister had a vote of no confidence from within her own party, a vote of no confidence in the Government which they won yesterday because they have a confidence and supply agreement, but, yet again breaking records,  MPs voted against the Prime Ministers deal -

You would probably have to go to Holyrood to find anything comparably inept.It wasnrsquot just that practically no one had a sensible solution for getting out of this mess ndash that is only to be expected, since there is no outcome that will not disappoint, and probably outrage, a sizeable proportion of the electorate. It was that so many MPs have not grasped the most obvious aspects of the issue.:Nicola Sturgeon readies Indy supporters to get out there and make the case for YesSome speeches, it is true, were only ludicrously detached from reality, imagining the UK as some sort of Singaporean laissez-faire paradise or, from the other side, arguing that the EU would like to extend all its advantages, and none of its tiresome rules about markets to us gratis, while Jeremy Corbyn turns the country into Venezuela.But other statements ndash not least Mr Corbynrsquos ndash indicated that many MPs have yet to get clear such minor points as the dference between the customs union and the single market. There were numerous declarations that there was no majority in the Commons for ldquono deal, without any apparent comprehension of the legal reality that itrsquos exactly what they did provide thumping majorities for, when they triggered Article , and then voted down Theresa Mayrsquos abysmal deal.There were, it must be conceded, two good performances in the no confidence debate: the speeches of Tom Watson and Michael Gove, winding up for either side. Alas, however, both demonstrated the flaws in the Government and the Labour Party ndash and in their own words, rather than those of their opponent.Mr Watsonrsquos ldquomore in sorrow than in anger approach was brilliantly effective. He said what a dficult and thankless task it was, and that, despite her admirable sense of duty, dedication and tenacity, Mrs May had nonetheless made a worse job of it than literally anyone  would have. This was all not just incontestably true but shiningly obvious, until one looked to the man sitting beside Mr Watson, at which point it was possible to think of at least one person who might have made an even more cackhanded go of it.:Gordon Brown: Wait for a year and let the people decide on BrexitThat, in turn, made the inevitable conclusion of Mr Watsonrsquos speech ndash when he called for a General Election ndash automatically anti-climactic. The entire population of the UK, one suspects, were with him while he said how useless the current executive is, and that the sooner we get rid of them the better. But the moment he said ldquoelection, we woke up and asked ourselves how that could possibly sort any of our current problems out.Not just because the choice between the two main Westminster parties doesnrsquot actually offer either Remainers or Leavers an obvious camp to join, nor even because Mr Corbynrsquos current policy is even more incoherent than Mrs Mayrsquos, with the added bonus of being located in cloud-cuckooland. But because, evenany party were advocating a coherent position Liberal Democrats and the SNP are, it is bound ndash whatever form it takes, Remain, Leave or some compromise like the EEA ndash to be one that will, first, anger and alienate half the country and, second, that there will be no one competent to deliver. Mrs May and Mr Corbyn may be the two least impressive politicians of the past century, but only the demented would think that Sir Vince Cable or Nicola Sturgeon are a notable improvement.Mr Goversquos speech had a similar self-detonating mechanism. He was excellent on pointing out that Mr Watson hadnrsquot mentioned his own party leader, and provided a comprehensive account of his manest unsuitability for office. He also got a nice dig in at Ian Blackford, who failed to mention fishing during his -minute speech. But all that those lines of attack did was to highlight the fact that anyone could have flung the same sort of argument at him.Leaving the Common Fisheries Policy and halting freedom of movement are the only two things which Mrs Mayrsquos plan offered to deliver, from the long list of promised advantages held out by, inter alia, Mr Gove during the referendum campaign. Itrsquos true that no one from the Leave campaign has actually been allowed to do anything to shape the current policy, but Mr Gove must know how pathetic what is on offer looks next to what was anticipated.And he must know where to place the blame, too, which is, like Mr Watson, with the person sitting next to him on his own front bench. Presumably to avoid the charge he levelled against the Labour deputy leader, he did mention Mrs May. Once. When saying that a lot of jobs had been created under her ldquoinspirational leadership, words which must surely have prompted a hollow laugh as he wrote them.It is horric to think of where we are now, compared with where we might have beenthere were anyone in power at Westminster with a tenth of the leadership qualities the British public would have demanded even from junior cabinet ministers a couple of decades ago.

No other Prime Minister in history has been defeated so comprehensively and survived, yet she still soldiers on, not for something new, but again, to wear down those who might help her across the finishing line with the battered Brexit battle plan she carries in her handbag, be they friend or foe. This plan she presents, her Brexit, is only the sum of the prejudices of the ious factions of her own party, her red lines the boundaries beyond which one faction or the other could or would never stray.The other parties are surely aware that the only agenda for any tea party will be ldquocould your get members to agree to a bit of tweaking on the Irish backstop and other small issues and go back to Parliament for a further vote  What would you want in  What the discussion will not include will be the removal of the \"no deal\" option, a consideration of a Peoples Vote or a fresh look at any of the \"prepack\" options like the EEA. The Tories would string her up for that. And that is what it is still all about ndash party politics, nothing to do with cross-party consensus or an appeal for National unity.Having almost given up on the prospect of a Peoples Vote and watching this shameless woman reduce the governance of our country to a farce, the only way out now is to pull back, to take leaving the EU off the agenda. Itrsquos not at all dficult we just tell the EU that we cannot agree how to leave the club and that we will remain until we can up with something better. Embarrassment, humiliation  That should be no problem, weve been there and dredged the bottom of that barrel alreadyFor us, the people sitting at home watching the TV, working away and going about our daily business, perhaps a few years of peace and normality will be good for us and help heal the wounds which this fiasco has inflicted on our communities. I suspect however that Mrs May will still be carrying \"her deal\" round in her handbag begging for votes wherever and whenever the opportunity arises. She may talk about how much this issue has ided the nation, but after the events of the week I suspect she really doesnrsquot care too much.Ian McLaren, Buchanan Drive, Lenzie.IF there is to be another referendum on the EU, surely it will be a second referendum, with a dferent question or questions. People who claim its a re-run of the first referendum with Remainers attempting to overturn the  result are mistaken. The first referendum was a binary Remain or Leave question. The next referendum should be about the final deal negotiated and whether, given the terms, the electorate now wish to stay in the EU or leave.The \"will of the people\" changes at every election. Theresa Mays mistake was to seek to implement the will of a very small majority of those who voted.Lizanne MacKenzie, Albert Road, Dumfries.IN the midst of the political turmoil over finding a way out on Brexit that commands majority support, Nicola Sturgeon concludes that what Scotland can best contribute is more constitutional uncertainty, as she continues the SNP tactic of treating Scotland like its plaything.Apparently the First Minister will set out a timetable for independence in a ldquomatter of weeks . It is not enough that amongst all this constitutional isiveness, she imagines giving us some more will help, but also Scotland is to be toyed with as Ms Sturgeon holds the threat over us, no doubt hoping to pick the moment when she can cause maximum disruption.Her purpose might or might not be to genuinely seek another vote, as she surely realises what little appetite there will be for it.

Baird is sitting in a hotel lobby in London, apologising in advance for any trad jazz that might be filtering down the phone line. ldquoJust so you know, theyrsquore piping it through the walls itrsquos not my taste, he says, his Aberdeenshire accentcutting through the background din.As it happens, hersquos been spending a lot of time in hotels over the last couple of months. His new film, the late-years Laurel  Hardy biopic Stan  Ollie, is currently part of this seasonrsquos awards circuit, with a Golden Globe nomination already in the bag for John C Reillyrsquos transformative turn as Oliver Hardy. That means Baird has also been on the campaign trail, zipping back-and-forth between London, Los Angeles and New York to do QAs with Reilly and co-star Steve Cooganand getting influential industry heavyweights to introduce screenings. Just a few days earlier, for instance, Baird found himself in the surreal position of having Martin Scorsese introduce the film in New York.ldquoHa! Irsquom glad you picked up on that it saves me doing my usual name-dropping, he says, with a self-deprecating laugh.Turns out Scorsese is something of a friend and mentor. They first met three-and-a-half years ago after Baird made the Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth.Scorsese was looking for directors to work on his and Mick Jaggerrsquos short-lived HBO drama Vinyl and he tapped Baird to helm one of the episodes. Baird remembers meeting him for the first time and telling him he was the reason he got into film-making.ldquoBy the look on his face you could tell he sort of hears this all the time. He was probably thinking I was going to mention Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Goodfellas, but then I said that King of Comedy was the one that really got me interested in film-making and he instantly became engaged on a really intense level.ldquoI donrsquot think many people pick that out as one of his best movies.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin Clark MP, UK Government Minister Lord Duncan and cllr Gillian Owen at the opening event\"  New centre opened in BalmedieviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"David Cook , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  Unit to breathe new le into council services viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"ldquoFrom that moment, he kind of took me under his wing and ever since then, whenever I go to New York I go round to his house and wersquoll have a cup of tea or Irsquoll go to the edit and hersquoll show me stuff from the latest film hersquos been working on. It is like a boyhood dream.Of course, Scorsese is also a walking encyclopaedia of film history, so the fact that Baird has made a film about arguably the greatest cinematic comedy double act of all time must have made him a good person to have in his corner. ldquoHe did mentor me on Stan  Ollie, confirms Baird, who specically sought his technical advice on how to shoot the moviersquos dazzling opening scene: an extended one-take tracking shot following Laurel and Hardy at the peak of their career as they walk through a studio backlot in .ldquoWe only had one day to shoot that because we were in Pinewood and Star Wars had taken all the stages, says Baird. ldquoIt was unbelievable. ldquoWe planned it like a military operation.If the sequence owes something to the cinematic craft of the Copacabana nightclub scene in Scorsesersquos Goodfellas, it also feels like a sly homage to the opening shot of Robert Altmanrsquos Hollywood satire The Player, immediately setting this up as more of a bittersweet look at what happens to movie stars when the glare of the spotlight fades.When Stan  Ollie cuts to  years later, for instance, the protagonists are in a very dferent place.Fondly remembered by the public, but out of step with contemporary tastes, theyrsquore unable to secure even aphone call from producers as they embark on what feels, at first, like a grin-and-bear-it tour of Britainrsquos regional music halls, performing their old routines up and down the country, including in Glasgow, where the Lancashire-born Stan Laurel spent the latter part of his childhood and secured his first professional gig, aged , at the Panopticon.ldquoI didnrsquot really know about Laurelrsquos connection to Scotland until I started doing this film, says Baird, who has fond memories of his own childhood love of watching Laurel and Hardy films on TV in the late s and early s.ldquoTherersquos a picture of me as an eight year-old that my mum still has of me dressed as Stan Laurel at the school fancy dress party, he says.The enduring appeal of Laurel and Hardy is something the filmrsquos melancholic plot zeroes in on and though Reillyrsquos performance is justly winning the lionrsquos share of the acclaim, Cooganrsquos take on Laurel as the quiet, professionally-minded workhorse is perhaps the more relatable.It certainly seems more applicable to Bairdrsquos own career. Having grown up in a fishing town with no family connection to the arts world , he kept his own film-making ambitions secret, moving to London and working in telesales until a friend who worked for a newspaper tipped him off to an entry level job at a production company about to be advertised in the recruitment section.ldquoHe told them there was no space to run it that week and gave me the number. ldquoSo I phoned them up, had an interview, got the job and started the next week, by which point the advert had run and they got  applications.ldquoI know, because I had to st through all the mail!Even now, it still feels like becoming a director was a bit of a pipe dream.ldquoBut I think that made me work a lot harder. I had to. It was either work hard and put everything into it or it was never going to happen. ldquoSo Irsquom glad now, but there were a lot of dark days getting here.Jonrsquos formative years were spent in Peterhead. Educated at the local academy, he worked for his fatherrsquos roofing company and ndash like so many other young loons ndash also worked at the port.He even did work experience at the Buchanie!Despite all this, however, he harboured dferent ambitions ndash he wanted to see his name in lights.In an interview with the Buchanie in , he said: ldquoMy uncle lived in Hampshire and we used to visit him twice a year.

Cllr Anne Stirling, Chair of the Communities Committee, explained: “Since the publication of our ten-year strategies for Culture and Sport in April , we have been working hard on a new model of delivery which will allow elected members and staff to best ensure the needs and demands of Aberdeenshire residents are met and our strategic aims achieved.“A considerable amount of work is ongoing by staff across several council services to make this possible and residents will reap the benefits in the improved quality of service that will be achieved.” As part of the new way of working, a sub committee of the Communities Committee has been created to drive the new delivery model and help investigate ways to remove barriers to participation.David Cook, recently retired Assistant Principal of Banff and Buchan College, is one of the externally recruited industry experts volunteering their time to drive forward Live Le Aberdeenshire.David, who has held distinguished roles in the charity and business sectors, for which he won the UK Manager of the Year title in , Chairs the Sub Committee. He commented: “I have always been passionate about the contribution that sport and culture can make not only to quality of le but also to people’s fundamental health and wellbeing.“I am pleased my experience, which includes marketing and funding, will be put to good use and I look forward to helping lead the development of Live Le Aberdeenshire and the benefit this will bring to local communities.”Cllr Anne Stirling added: “Aberdeenshire Council has stated in its Key Priorities that it will encourage active lestyles and promote wellbeing with a focus on obesity and mental health. We have also recognised the valuable contribution sport and culture make to raising levels of attainment and achievement in our children and young people. We look forward very much to working with our industry experts and benefitting from the many skills they have generously agreed to share with Council Members and staff.” John Harding, Head of Service for the newly created Live Le Aberdeenshire, is committed to empowering local staff to deliver services which best meet the needs of their local communities. He said: “We have had a long, hard look at the ways we work together across services and how we can act jointly to ensure we can improve the experiences of service users. This is an ongoing and sometimes challenging process but one that is very rewarding and productive.” data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The event has been organised by make up artists Julia Stronach and Alana McCrae\"  Beauticians to host ‘Make Off’ viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Live Le Aberdeenshire was launched with the signing of a Statement of Ambition which articulates how council services will strive together to make this new, more flexible service work.

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues.

Tourists visiting Scotland may also have some fun by using the haggis emoji as part of their messages to friends and family at home.

It is too dangerous a prospect even to try to use as part of the UK Government’s negotiating strategy, whether with Brussels or MPs.However, the Labour leader is absolutely wrong in his refusal to meet Theresa May until she does so.Instead, Corbyn should immediately enter talks with the Prime Minister with that main aim in mind. If he manages to find a way to prevent a no-deal Brexit, he will have done his country a considerable service, saving the jobs and livelihoods of people across the country.Of course, May is the one who is currently in charge and she might be able to claim the credit, but the time for seeking political victories is over. The UK is in a deep and serious crisis and urgently needs everyone to work in the national interest.: Date set for MPs to debate Theresa May’s Brexit ‘plan B’In his letter to May yesterday, Corbyn correctly described a no-deal Brexit as “disastrous”, but he then claimed that “entering into talks while the clock continues to run down, and the threat of a chaotic ‘no deal’ increases, would be a reckless leap in the dark”.Talking about preventing a disaster is not reckless not talking about preventing a disaster is idiotically reckless.In her letter of reply, May made an error of logic when she argued that ruling out a no-deal was an “impossible condition because it is not within the Government’s power”.She said there were two ways to avoid a no-deal: for MPs to vote for a deal that had been agreed with the EU – meaning her deal, the one that suffered the biggest Commons defeat for a Government bill in modern history – or for Article  to be revoked and the result of the  referendum overturned. “I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result,” she added. So it’s not “impossible” to prevent a no-deal, it’s simply contrary to a belief held by May.Postponing the date of Brexit would not overturn the  referendum result, but it would allow more time and mean Britain was not railroaded into a Withdrawal Agreement that even some of the most ardent Brexiteeers say would be worse than remaining in the EU.It would allow a second referendum to be held, in which the people of Britain could decide whether no-deal is better than May’s bad one orit’s time to call the whole thing off and remain in the European Union.: Brexit: Here’s how we can escape this highway to hell – Bill Jamieson©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4858420.1547760416!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit article 50 could be rescinded hammond tells business leaders","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Chancellor Philip Hammond told business leaders that a no-deal Brexit could be #taken off the table# and Article  #rescinded#, according to a transcript of a leaked conference call.The transcript, obtained by a newspaper, details Mr Hammond speaking with  business leaders just hours after Theresa May lost the parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal.Mr Hammond began the call by explaining that the defeat raised two questions can Article  be revoked and “whether we can somehow take the option of no deal off the table”.The Chancellor said the EU would not consider extending Article  “unless or until we have a clear plan to go forward” and the “large majority” in the commons are opposed to a no-deal “in any circumstances”.He referred to a cross-party Bill, from Tory MP Nick Boles, which aims to force the government to extend Article a Brexit deal cannot be reached, according to the report.On Monday, MPs will vote on an amendment that will “pave the way for the Bill”, the paper said.Mr Hammond said: “What this group of backbenchers has been doing is seeking to find a mechanism by which the House of Commons can express that view in a way which is binding and effective.”The business leaders sought assurances from Mr Hammond, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Business Secretary Greg Clark, who were also on the call, that a no-deal could be ruled out.Doug Gurr, head of Amazon UK, reportedly said ruling out a no deal would give “comfort” to global boards.But Mr Hammond said it would not be until next week that things became clearer.John Allan, chairman of Tesco and president of the CBI, askedtaking a no-deal Brexit off the table reduced the UK’s negotiating power with the EU.Mr Hammond said removing options had consequences.Mr Hammond added: “The government is not in control of this. I am only telling you what information I have been able to glean. My understanding is that because the bill being brought forward will simply and solely rescind the Article  notice, the legal opinion that they have is that that will meet the test that the European Court of Justice has laid down for unilateral recision of an Article  notice.

proposals for how to break the deadlock on  January.The announcement came as the Prime Minister and Jeremy Corbyn argued over holding talks to reach a compromise.The Labour leader dismissed Mrs May’s invitation to meet as a “stunt” after asking his backbenchers not to attend talks with ministers until the government rules out a no-deal Brexit.But senior Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn broke his embargo, while Leave-supporting MP John Mann was also spotted coming out of the same building on Whitehall.Ms Cooper defended joining the negotiations in a move that placed the trio in open conflict with Mr Corbyn after he had expressed his wishes in an email to Labour colleagues.In a letter to the Labour leader, Mrs May said ruling out no-deal Brexit was an “impossible condition” because the government does not have the power to do so. “You have always believed in the importance of dialogue in politics,” Mrs May added.“Do you really believe that, as well as declining to meet for talks yourself, it is right to ask your MPs not to seek a solution with the government ”Downing Street has also refused to consider a second EU referendum or extending Article .First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Prime Minister’s office of talks was “a promise to listen, but onlywe all agree with her”.“The SNP won’t be complicit in more time wasting,” she posted on Twitter on Wednesday. “Rule out no deal, be prepared to extend Art  and agree to at least consider another referendum – then we’ll talk.”The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has indicated Brussels was ready to respond to any revision of Mrs May’s “red line” demands, telling MPs in Portugal: “If they change, we’ll change.”Mr Barnier said “something has to change” to secure a orce deal.Some MPs met with the Prime Minister and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, while others saw Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.Among those arriving for talks were a group of eurosceptic Tories, including former Brexit secretary David Davis and ERG vice-chairman Steve Baker, as well as Green MP Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price and the DUP’s Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster.Emerging from her meeting, Mrs Foster said the issue of the Irish backstop needed to be dealt with “in a very clear way”Brexit negotiations were to progress.Mr Corbyn was in work at

But unfortunately it is the residents who are suffering from the impact of all of this.“Depending on the direction of the wind the smell can be so bad it makes me feel nauseous and sometimes you just want to get out of the area to get some fresh air.“You cant hang out clothes, open your windows or sit in your garden. It affects your well-being because you are always thinking how long am I going to have to live with this or will I have to sell-up, leave the home that I have put a lot of effort into and have lived in for many years  The possible health implications are also a major concern.”She continued: “It is not just me there are residents in the area who have farms or homes that have been in their families for generations.“There are other issues as well as the odour and I feel like we are the guinea pigs in all of this.“The company have told us they are working to fix the problem and we are meeting with them again on February .”One man who has lived in the area all his le but does not wish to be named, said he will have to think about movingthe situation does not improve.He stated: “The smell at times is terrible. It is a gassy smell but there is also a rotten smell to it, its hard to explain.“We cant open our windows even during the warm weather. We tried to have them open but I had to get up in the middle of the night to close them the smell was so bad.“Last summer when the weather was good everyone was out enjoying their gardens and having barbecues but we had to either sit in the house or go out to eat somewhere.”He continued: “We were told at the start that we would hear, smell or see nothing but that is not the case. “When the smell gets into the house it takes a long time for it to go. I have even had people saying they can smell it when they are driving along the Craigadoo Road and they ask me how do you stick it .“My we loves to garden but she cant because of the smell. I have lived in the area all my le andthis doesnt improve we will have to consider moving.”TUV MLA, Jim Allister, called on the company to “take urgent action”.Mr Allister led a delegation of residents to a meeting with senior management at the plant on Tuesday, January .He said: For several months these residents have been afflicted with unbearable odours from the plant which processes poultry litter.“When seeking planning permission the plant owners assured everyone they were installing state of the art technology which would ensure no smells. The supposed super efficient technology has failed and now local residents are paying the price.”Mr Allister has vowed towith the residents for a further meeting.He said he would also be pressing the Northern Ireland Environment Agency “to step up its supervision and action”.“The present intolerable position cannot continue,” he concluded.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, NIEA, was aware of odour complaints relating to the Anaerobic Digestion facility at Moorfields Road, Tully Quarry.A spokesperson for the Department said: “This facility is regulated by NIEA under a Pollution Prevention and Control Permit and the permit holder is Anaerobic Advantage Ltd.“NIEA agrees that odour management at the facility has not been acceptable and the facility is currently not in compliance with its permit. In response NIEA has been working with the operator in recent months resulting in the operator taking numerous steps attempting to mitigate and resolve the problems. “NIEA staff have visited a number of the residents during this time and we have also worked in close co-operation with the local council Environmental Health officer to obtain information on the odour impact from local residents.“As a result of investigations NIEA issued an Enforcement Notice on  October  requiring the operator to provide detailed proposals to fully resolve the odour problem. The operator has now provided their proposals for additional odour treatment and it is expected this work should be completed by end of January .“NIEA will continue to inspect the site on a regular basis, maintain pressure on the operator to take all necessary actions to minimise odour nuisance and liaise with local residents to keep them updated on progress.”In a statement Stream BioEnergy Ltd said: “We acknowledge and respect the concerns raised and we are continuing to work hard to resolve these as quickly as possible.”  "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8765042.1547127501!/image/image.jpg","title":"business  ","story":"Banbridge company Ferguson#s Irish Linen recently took part in an Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council led trade mission to Western India with other companies seeking new business opportunities.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

In Belfast we have load of Victoria places. A hospital, a shopping mall, a university. We also have a bridge named after Queen Elizabeth. Of course those named venues are not really about the women they are named after. We all know it is about their position, the reign of empire and monarchy.The only other place named after a woman that I am aware of is the Mary Peters’ Track. Unlike the aforementioned, it is hard to view that negatively. Mary earned it the hard way.There are also very, very, few places named after working class heroes. As we walk our streets in West Belfast we walk on the roads named after imperial battles or, less insultingly, places like Donegal. The exception is the Michael Ferguson Roundabout named after the beloved councillor who died too young but had dedicated his short le to the people of Colin.In the s, when standing in the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow, being hosted by Mikail Gorbachev, Mrs Emma Groves was handed a blini with caviar. She turned to the only other woman in attendance from West Belfast, Clara Reilly, and said, “I think I’d prefer a fish supper.” That night at the performance, Clara sat beside her friend Emma, who had no sight but could hear the glorious music, and she described to Emma the intricate costumes and the air-like dancing.Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were not there on a jolly. They were not invited as political favour. They had travelled to Moscow at the height of the Cold War to ask for help for the most forgotten and dismissed of victims of our conflict. They lobbied for Soviet support to end the use of plastic and rubber bullets. In the same breath we can mention a similar visit by these two women to Washington to lobby the other side of Cold War incredibly impressive human rights advocacy that would be recognised more universally had they not been Irish women from West Belfast highlighting British state abuses. Mrs Clara Reilly embodies the spirit of freedom. A spine of steel and a heart of gold. Her story is yet to be written. But she has some of that story still to write.When Emma Groves passed away, she was carried by those who loved her, including Clara, in a willow basket. She epitomised humility. It was no surprise that her final wishes were to contribute to the earth. She gave example to us all.Both women shone a light of humanity in the darkest of days. Despite horric violations of injury and bereavement visited upon them both, they could only think of others who they used their hearts and strength to support and advocate on behalf of. While other human rights advocates on this island looked to South Africa or Nicaragua in safety, these women stood in their own streets and insisted on human rights beginning at home.This weekend Belfast will have a new nameplate. This time for two working class women who would not be silenced or intimidated. Who refused to allow a line of expedient amnesia to be drawn during our peace process. Our streets become richer with their names. The history of human rights in Ireland will now speak of Emma and Clara. Our friends.

I worked there for a further two years under the stewardship of Jim Deery, who I owe a lot to. Jim really gave me a foot up when I needed it. I cut my teeth in the back streets of the New Lodge learning about social justice, community development and participative democracy.“I always knew I wanted to work with young people – it’s my passion. In St Malachy’s I spent as many free periods as I could get playing football as opposed to studying – I wanted to do teaching at that time, but I wasn’t really interested in the A-Levels I was doing.“There was always that draw to work with people, young people in particular. My mummy was always heavily involved in the community and volunteering, so I also have that family background.”After six years at the Star, Chris went on to become a Senior Development Officer at the Bytes Project before taking up a post as the Children and Young People’s Coordinator with Belfast City Council, where he helped set up a city youth forum and Belfast’s first skate park.Remarkably, he took up the Director’s role at NIYF just a few years later when he was just  years old. It presented a massive new challenge, which Chris insists he was well prepared to meet, despite his young age.“It was definitely in my DNA,” he said.“It’s about building the capacity of young people to affect positive change.“We always talk about young people being part of the solution as opposed to being the problem, and again I have to pay credit to Jim Deery, he was the one who schooled me in that chain of thought.“All of those people in the Star really heavily influenced my thinking. All of my jobs since leaving school, whether it was in voluntary or paid capacity, had that underbelly. It’s about people making positive change for themselves.“When the job in the Youth Forum came up it was like a dream job, it was allowing me to do something that I had been practising for years, but only on a regional basis.“The role here is very strategic. You’re linked into government, you’re linked into the EU, we’re presenting to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, so we’re doing all of this amazing work internationally as well as locally.“We are working with young people who are on the margins, such as homeless young people, and seeing those young people building their own capacity to affect change in their own lives and communities is amazing.”He continued: “Some days I feel like I should come in with a firefighter’s hat, because you spend an awful lot of time fighting fires and managing mini crises.“A big part of the job is strategising, lobbying and campaigning. I often talk about speaking truth to power, so it’s about bringing the voice of young people to those in a position of power. Sometimes that’s uncomfortable for those in positions of power, because you’re banging down doors to try to affect change for the marginalised people in society. Every day is a battle. You’re fighting a fight for people who are getting the rough end of the stick.”In an ever-changing world, the problems faced by young people have become increasingly complex, and Chris says that many of them are challenges faced by young people the world over. However, he believes that legacy of our recent conflict makes many of our own young people’s challenges unique.“Whether you’re in Belfast, Paris or Sydney, there are massive problems around mental health, drugs, poverty, exclusion and all of these things you can apply to any area,” he said.“The big thing here is the legacy of the past – it’s the lens that magnies all of these problems. I would relate a lot of the reasons our high suicide rates and mental ill-health to the conflict and the legacy of the past. There is a lot we still don’t know we talk about transgenerational trauma. You just need to look out the window and you can see people living with these issues and a lot of it is linked to the conflict. If we don’t deal with legacy and we don’t deal with the conflict then that’s not going to go away.”Despite the magnitude of the task ahead, Chris and the NIYF are relentless in their pursuit of a better society. After serving that eye-opening apprenticeship he now heads one of the largest providers of non-formal education in the country. There is undoubtedly a lesson to be learned from his experience.“I know it’s a cliché, but what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” he said.“Every time you are faced with a challenge it can be a valuable lesson. Again, another cliché, sometimes you learn more in failure than in success. I’m a great believer in ‘Mól an óige agus tiocfaidh sí – praise the youth and they shall prosper’.“In my work le and in my voluntary work teaching kids in sport I try to teach them about work ethic. I try to teach them that hard work beats talent and that talent doesn’t work hard.“The education system as it is set up is designed for maybe  per cent of high achievers, so in my opinion it is failing so many young people. Non-formal education, for us, is about finding that passion. For us it’s about encouraging young people to find the thing that lights the fire in their belly.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"poignant site set to be named after clara and emma","story":"LORD Mayor Deirdre Hargey, along with community leaders, are to attend the unveiling of ‘Groves Reilly Corner’ at the former Andersonstown barracks site in tribute to the late Emma Groves and fellow human rights campaigner Clara Reilly. The renaming of the site, taking place on Saturday, is especially poignant as it is where Emma and Clara stood for decades in protest at human rights abuses and in memory of those fatally injured and killed by plastic bullets. Speaking ahead of the unveiling Relatives For JusticeDirector Mark Thompson said: “What these two women have given our community and achieved is remarkable and as a community, a society, a country, we have been privileged and blessed to have had them there for us all.”Mark added: “And it is this very combination of their work, humanity and humility, which they bring to that very vocation of standing up for rights when and where required that makes them stand out even though they’d be the first to shy away from such public accolades. “Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were also instrumental in establishing Relatives for Justice , our NGO, in April , ensuring that a holistic support and care package, from professional therapeutic counselling support for trauma survivors partnering a rights based advocacy casework approach for addressing human rights violations, framed our work. We stand on the shoulders of giants in the sense that ordinary people both made extraordinary sacrices and did extraordinary work at great personal risk in extraordinary times. “Their motto was simple, in that they paraphrased Edmund Burke, in saying ‘That evil can only flourish when good people remain silent.’ They refused to stay silent,” he said. Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described Emma Groves and Clara Reilly as “two lives of resistance”.“Two women who were leaders in their community –and Clara still is,” said Paul. “Many communities would be lucky to have had one of these indomitable fighters. Belfast and beyond had two but for the saddest of reasons. We say that Emma was ‘blinded by a rubber bullet’ in November  but she was actually blinded by a British soldier, a Para, who deliberately fired a rubber bullet at her face. “There wasn’t even an allegation that she was a phantom gunwoman or nail bomber. She simply refused to turn off the rebel songs she was playing in her own home. At some level the British Government must have regretted that day because Emma Groves went on to campaign, highlight, expose, denounce and bear witness to the dangers posed by rubber and plastic bullets in the following decades.“It is totally appropriate that the site of the former Andersonstown RUC barracks, scene of so many pickets with Emma and Clara, should now be renamed to honour these two strong working class women who did so much for others. “The chattering classes can keep their MBEs and CBEs. Clara and Emma are and were real heroes. And Relatives for Justice is a fitting tribute to all those years of dedication and struggle.”NI Amnesty Programme Director Patrick Corrigan recalled first meeting Emma Groves and Clara in the early s when “in Emma’s living room in Andersonstown, over a cup of tea, she told her harrowing story”.“Wearing her trademark dark glasses, she recounted the day in  when she lost the sight of both eyes after being shot in the face at point-blank range with a rubber bullet. Like so many stories from our recent conflict, Emma Groves’ inidual experience was of one of unwarranted violence and unnecessary pain.Clara Reilly and Emma Groves founded the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets to bring together families bereaved or injured by rubber and plastic bullets and to end their use here and everywhere.“Campaigning by Emma Groves and Clara Reilly shone a light on the human rights abuses and suffering inflicted through use of the weapons, and inspired many to stand with them. They would later help found Relatives for Justiceand inspire its model of mutual support and advocacy.”Ancient Order of Hibernians’ Sean Pender added: “We are proud to add our voice to recognise Clara Reilly and Emma Groves as the community that they worked so hard and long for dedicates the junction of Falls, Glen and Andersonstown Road in their honour.“These two remarkable women stood strong and never wavered in their quest for justice and peace. The AOH was proud to have honoured Clara with its highest award, the Seán McBride humanitarian award, several years ago in recognition of her long history of civil and human rights work.“It is entirely appropriate that there will be an area that will forever recognise the work of these two great women.”The Groves, Reilly and Livingstone families are lelong friends and played prominent roles in the campaign to ban plastic bullets. Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone said: “It was a pleasure and a privilege to have known Emma and to know Clara. The line of placards on the road beside the barracks was and is a familiar August sight and my family can think of no better place and no better way to celebrate the inspirational lives of two amazing women.” The unveiling of Groves Reilly Corner will take place on Saturday January  at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners to seek a judicial review over 45m craigavon","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its that we dont want it at the expense of a park the community loves and enjoys.\"This is a very complex application, and it should have been dealt with at a higher level. \"Despite asking for a postponement, given this complexity, we were told that wasnt going to happen.\"People are furious at what they see as a corporate decision, not a decision on behalf of the community.\"Ms Laverty claimed that a judicial review would \"finally show up the flaws in the decision-making process, allow us to bring our own experts and give us access to documents we have not been able to see, including the councils masterplan for the area\".Among those speaking against the plan on Wednesday night was Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie, who said the council had chosen the wrong location.\"Craigavon needs development, and South Regional College will be good for that, good for jobs and regeneration, but this is the wrong place,\" Mr Beattie added. \"This is a park for the people, an open space for recreationbeneficial to wellbeing and mental health. \"A college on this scale will fundamentally change the nature of the area.\"Mr Beattie also accused the council of acting disingenuously, having previously zoned the land for tourism, culture and recreation.He said: \"Over , people have said they dont want to see the college located there, but the elected representatives on the council are ignoring them. All those people have my support in seeking a judicial review.\"Backers of the plan maintained other options had been considered, but the lakeside location was the most appropriate because of its central and neutral location, with good public transport links.Southern Regional College has plans for five acres of replacement habitat to compensate for the construction of the low-rise building. It said the approval was \"fantastic news which would support hundreds of construction jobs and transform education\"."},{"url":null,"title":"fermanagh couples joy at birth of grandkids a world apart on same day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On that day the couples son Sean and daughter Claire both welcomed the arrival of two bouncing and healthy babies: a boy born in Perth, Australia, and a girl who arrived in Vancouver, Canada.The extraordinary coincidence is that although the two infants were born more than , miles apart, it was on the same day - , like gran and grandad, you live in Northern Ireland. However, because of the dferent time zones in Australia and Canada, they have dferent dates of birth. Perth and Vancouver have a -hour time dference, Perth being eight hours ahead of us and Vancouver eight hours behind. Baby Holly Sturgeon was the first of the new grandchildren to arrive on January , weighing in at lb .oz. She was born at .am GMT in Vancouver, the first child of the Flanagans daughter Claire and her husband Antony Sturgeon, who is from Belfast. Claire , a construction engineer, and Antony , a university co-ordinator, married in November  and moved to Canada the following year. The couple had been expecting Holly to make an appearance in time for the New Year celebrations, as she was due on December . For Caroline, the first week of  has certainly been eventful. On January  she retired from BT in Enniskillen, where she had worked for  years. Then came the surprise two new arrivals three days later. She told the Belfast : \"It has been quite the start to  already after leaving work and then welcoming the two new grandchildren just a few days later. \"I have hardly left the phone down in a fortnight because there has been so much going on. \"Whenever Holly was born I phoned my daughter-in-law Caitriona in Australia to tell her the news. \"She and Sean were also expecting a baby, and just a couple of hours later Fionn arrived. \"He didnt give his parents much warning and the ambulance didnt make it in time, so he was born at home. \"Thankfully everything went smoothly and they were both taken to hospital afterwards to be checked over.\" Weighing in at lbs oz, baby Fionn Flanagan is the second child for Sean and Caitriona. The couple married in July , and are already parents to -month-old Niamh. Sean , also a construction engineer, and Derry native Caitriona , a nurse, have lived in the capital of Western Australia for  years. \"Fionn had been due on January  but also arrived on the th at am Irish time,\" Caroline said.\"Perhaps he couldnt stay put after his big cousin Holly arrived,\" Caroline said. Caroline and Pat, who have been married for  years, also have a daughter Judi , who lives in Belfast. As she begins her retirement, there wont be much time to rest for the proud gran, as she is preparing to travel to Canada at the end of this month to meet little Holly.

There was a baby in the back and, with another man, we got the baby out.“Then I went to the black car to help and realised it was the Duke of Edinburgh.”AskedPhilip was trapped, Mr Warne said: “Yes, he was. I asked him to move his left leg and that freed his right leg and then I helped him get out.”When questioned about what the duke said, he replied: “I can’t remember, but it was nothing rude.“He was obviously shaken, and then he went and askedeveryone  was all right.”Mr Warne said the duke was able to stand and walk immediately after getting out of the car, but he appeared to suggest the duke may have been cut, possibly by broken glass.“There was a little bit of blood and one of the royal entourage gave me a wipe to wipe my hands,” he said.Buckingham Palace has said that after the accident the duke “saw a doctor as a precaution and the doctor confirmed he was not injured”.Commenting on the circumstances of the crash, Mr Warne added: “I think there’s no doubt that it was hit . That’s my recollection.“I didn’t see it come from the side road, I saw it careering and tumblingacross the road and ending up on the other side.“It would take a massive force and it had rolled on the other side as well.”Askedhe meant that the Freelander had “rolled right over”, Mr Warne said: “Yes.”The duke has been spending Christmas and New Year at Sandringham with the Queen. Steve Parsons PA WireDescribing how he helped the duke from his car, Mr Warne told Today: “I think I helped him out through either the sunroof or the front windscreen, but I’m a bit blurred about that.”Mr Warne was still on the scene when the ambulance arrived, but did not hear anyone discussing whether Philip should be taken to hospital.“I didn’t hear any discussion like that, but I was told he was taken to Sandringham House for assessment.”Askedthe duke thanked him, Mr Warne said: “No, but he wasn’t being discourteous or anything. He had other things on his mind, I’m sure.”Other eye witnesses have said how Philip, who retired from public duties in  but remains active, was left “shocked” following the accident.The Duke has remained active since retiring from public duties in  and takes a keen interest in the running of the Sandringham estate. Chris Radburn PA WireThe motorist suggested the duke may have been accompanied by an entourage in another car which is likely to have included police officers.He told Today: “A lot of people arrived very quickly.”Describing how he helped the occupants of the other car involved, Mr Warne said: “The person in the car behind me also stopped and a passenger from that car actually took the baby in his arms after we had freed it from the baby harness.“One of them had a broken arm. They were very shaken. One of them was the mother of the child and she was quite upset.“I think there’s no doubt that it was hit . That’s my recollection.”The accident crash scene has attracted media interest. John Stillwell PA WireThe crash happened at the Babingley crossroads on a stretch of the A which runs between the town of King’s Lynn and the north Norfolk coast.It is single carriageway and has a mph speed limit.Concerns had previously been raised about road safety on the A near Sandringham.By coincidence, Norfolk County Council is scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss plans to reduce the speed limit on the road from mph to mph and install safety cameras."},{"url":null,"title":"some common medicines in short supply","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But it is fair to say that recently the shortages have been worse than ever.“Every day, there are items that are on a short-term supply problem, so you might have to wait two or three days for them to come in, but they do come in eventually.“The message to patients is: ‘Please don’t leave picking up your medicines to the last minute at the moment’.”#checkbeforeyoutick - how can #Pharmacists help  Over .k people are now checking their entitlement to free #prescriptions online daily.

Shortages have been a problem for some years. It’s a fluctuating problem. They are now worse then ever.“The situation with Brexit is that the Government have recognised that there could be potential supply problems and they have been asking manufacturers to keep in a buffer stock so thatthere are freight problems, trouble with customs, patients will still get their drugs.“Unfortunately, what’s been happening on social media over Christmas is that people have been putting two and two together and assuming that this is because of Brexit.“The pharmaceutical supply chain is a very complex subject. There are global issues at play here.”The Royal Pharmaceutical Society told the BBC there was “a massive shortage and price spikes”.A monthly list of drugs in short supply is managed by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee .BBC analysis shows that the number of medications on the list has grown six-fold in three years.During this time, the peak period peak was in November , but there has been a recent rise.Ash Soni, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said he had never seen so many common drugs affected by shortages.He said: “The items are out of stock and unavailable. Patients are having to wait.“We’re having to send some patients back to the GP to get a dferent prescription, because we just can’t fill them.”The vast majority of medicines are not subject to supply problems and every day over two million prescription items are successfully dispensed in EnglandDepartment of Health spokeswomanFacebookTwitterGareth Jones of the National Pharmacy Association told the BBC: “Certainly we would advise patients to order medicines in advancethey can do, in case there are any problems. It gives the pharmacist more time to deal with it.“For the patient generally they can leave it to the pharmacist, who will do everything they can to source the supply.”One drug on the list for December is furosemide, which is used to treat high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems.Other drugs on the list include fluoxetine, which treats depression, and the anti-inflammatory naproxen.Mr Soni said naproxen went “completely out of stock” recently and he ended up paying £. a box, £ more than the NHS last agreed to pay for it.A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: “The Department has well-established processes to manage and mitigate the small number of supply problems that may arise at any one time due to manufacturing or distribution issues and this has always been the case.“We continue to work closely with industry and partners to ensure patients receive the medicines they need and pharmacies are reimbursed fairly.“The vast majority of medicines are not subject to supply problems and every day over two million prescription items are successfully dispensed in England.”"},{"url":null,"title":"this tiny miracle puppy survived being picked up and dropped by a hawk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The official said Mr Trump and Kim Jong Un had established a “good relationship” and that US-North Korea conversations were continuing.The official said the two sides were “working to make progress” on the denuclearisation goal and that Mr Trump “looks forward to meeting Chairman Kim again at their second summit at a place and time yet to be determined”.The talks had stalled over North Korea’s refusal to provide a detailed accounting of its nuclear and missile facilities that would be used by inspectors to very any deal to dismantle them. The North has been demanding that the US lt harsh sanctions and provide it with security guarantees before it takes any steps beyond its initial suspension of nuclear and missile tests.Kim Jong Un expressed frustration in an annual new year’s address over the lack of progress in negotiations.

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all. He works hard to help others and it is deeply upsetting that there are those in the community who would target of all things an honesty box.

The group of Independent councillors have held the balance of power on council and can swing the vote on issues vital to our community.Cllr Enright said there was a long tradition of Independent and environmentally-minded candidates winning one of the five seats in the Downpatrick and Lecale electoral area.He pointed to Independent hospital candidate, Raymond Blaney, who won a seat on the former Down Council almost  years ago, and the Green Partyrsquos Bill Corry winning a seat in .ldquoIn the  elections, Raymond nominated Bill and I acted as his election agent, while in the  and  elections, both Raymond and Bill supported my successful election campaigns, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoBoth ex-councillors will be active on my behalf for this Mayrsquos election and Bill is my election agent.Cllr Enright said at the  election to the new Newry, Mourne and Down Council, ldquoa remarkable coalition of activists from community organisations, the farming community and the environmental sector backed him to win the fourth of five seats, with an all time high of first preference votes for an independent candidate in the Downpatrick DEA.He believes the fact that he is one of the few local politicians who works full-time as a councillor has helped his support base in an area where he continues to work closely with community organisations in villages and in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Family’s plea to change organ donation system  ","story":"THE family of a Downpatrick man who died before he could get a heart transplant hope that an opt-out organ donation system will be soon introduced to Northern Ireland.Tommy McManusrsquos sister has revealed that even in their grief, the family honoured his commitment to organ donation by giving the  year-oldrsquos corneas so that someone  may see one day.Roisin Taggart said that she believes a system where people choose to opt out of donating their organs in the event of the death will increase the number of organs available.The current situation in Northern Ireland, as opposed to Scotland and Wales, is that people who do not wish to donate their organs have to opt-out by registering their details. England is to introduce an opt-out system in .Mrs Taggart said: ldquoWe need to talk about the people who have lost their battle for an organ. We need to put faces to these tragedies and we all need to make sure our families know about our wishes.Mr McManus was buried last Thursday in his home town after he died from multiple organ failure at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne on December .Despite being put on a ldquosuper-urgent transplant list just days before Christmas, he succumbed to his illness as he waited for a suitable heart to become available.A successful mechanical engineer who travelled the world with his career, Mr McManus became seriously ill in .After six months of investigations, doctors diagnosed that Mr McManus had suffered cardiac arrest.A heart transplant was ruled out as he was too ill at the time, but doctors did all they could for him by fitting a mechanical pump in anticipation of a new heart.Despite being born with a congenital heart defect known as Transposition of the Great Arteries, the former De La Salle High School student had already defied the odds to live a normal le up until then.Raised in the Colmcille Road area of Downpatrick, Mr McManus ed home to be close to his father Tom mdash his mother Colette had passed away earlier mdash sisters Lisa and Roisin and their families.While he waited on the standard transplant list for three years, Mrs Taggart said that her brother bore his illness well.ldquoTommy was unable to work or travel and relied heavily on us for basic day to day things like shopping, cleaning, etc, she said.ldquoHis mobility was extremely limited through fear of over-exertion. Still, he did everything he could to aid his recovery.Tommy and his family were so thankful to the medical team at the Freeman Hospital for saving his le in  that they raised over pound, in order ldquoto pay back the care they had received.Mrs Taggart says that her family know that the doctors ldquodid absolutely everything in their power to keep Tommy alive and had promised that he would have had his heart transplant before Christmas.ldquoThere is a typical wait of between - days for a heart and we just donrsquot know why one didnrsquot become available. But it didnrsquot and his lungs and kidneys began to fail as a consequence of his heart failure, said Mrs Taggart.Despite the efforts of the ldquophenomenal medical team, Tommy required dialysis and ventilation to keep him alive.The medical team were unable to get him breathing on his own again and he was taken off the transplant list.ldquoWe had seen Tommy go through some much and come out of the other side that it never crossed our minds that he wouldnrsquot get a heart, said Mrs Taggart.She and her family now know from personal experience just how hard it is to make a decision to donate a loved onersquos organs.ldquoDue to Tommyrsquos condition, he was only eligible to donate his corneas, she explained.ldquoWhen we were approached about this, my fatherrsquos immediate reaction was, lsquoNo, hersquos been cut into enoughrsquo, despite the fact that Tommy campaigned so passionately about organ donation, and we all knew his wishes.ldquoThankfully myself and my sister were able to be Tommyrsquos voice, and he was able to give one final and very precious gt to someone.ldquoWe desperately hope that the subject of organ donation can be normalised, and that a change in legislation and attitude is seen very soon. We are just so sorry that this change will come too late for Tommy.Mrs Taggart paid a loving tribute to her only brother: ldquoTommy was a fiercely independent, successful and outgoing young man. He was extremely intelligent, loved technology and was a fountain of knowledge.ldquoNo matter where he travelled, he made friends instantly.Mr McManus is survived by his father, sisters, brothers-in-law Bryon and Kieran, nephews Daniel, Paul and Matthew, nieces Emma and Erin, great-nephews Jay and Donal and great-nieces Chloe and Freya.bull To join the NHS organ donation register, go to www.organdonation.nhs.uk.register-your-details.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Finnebrogue to create 90 new jobs with new food ranges  ","story":"THE success of innovative Downpatrick firm Finnebrogue Artisan is set to continue with the opening of a new ultra-modern poundm vegan and vegetarian factory.The latest signicant investment by the award winning company mdash which is one of the districtrsquos leading employers mdash will support  new jobs with the new facility capable of turning over poundm a year.The latest investment by the company is in response to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan alternatives, with the ersication illustrating the firmrsquos willingness to respond to changing trends across the food industry.The artisan food producer, which has revolutionised the bacon and ham market in the past  months by launching the first mass-produced nitrite-free alternatives, has invested poundm as it looks to step up its meat-free offerings.Finnebrogue has been producing vegetarian and vegan products for three years, but the opening of a brand new factory marks a signicant up-scaling of the firmrsquos meat-free production.The companyrsquos managing director, Brian McMonagle, said Finnebrogue prided itself on providing consumers with ldquodelicious, innovative products.ldquoGiven the increasing demand for vegan and vegetarian alternatives, this new factory was the obvious next step in our extraordinary growth, he continued.ldquoWe are determined not to stand still and are always looking to make food the best it can possibly be, without being bound by the way itrsquos always been done. More and more people are switching to a vegan or vegetarian diet and even meat eaters are increasingly seeking a day or two off a week.Mr McMonagle added: ldquoAlongside the opening of our new factory, our new product development team is doing extensive work to make some of the tastiest meat-free products on the market.The Downpatrick firm is one of the fastest growing food manufacturers in the Province, with its turnover catapulting from just poundm in  to close to poundm in the current financial year.In addition to its soaring sausage business and ground-breaking Naked Bacon and Naked Ham, the firm is a top supplier of venison and wagyu beef to many leading retailers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 9%2C 1979  ","story":"SNOW mdash Heavy snow blizzards lashed the locality this week and weathermen say that yet more snow could fall before week is over.Downpatrick and coastal areas from Strangford through to Newcastle escaped the worst of the snow, but Carryduff, Comber, Ballynahinch, Dromara, Saintfield and Ballygowan were not so lucky.However, many parts of the district, including Downpatrick, were thrown into darkness when a transformer in Killyleagh caught fire. An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour. Jousting is a distinct possibility and so are a number of other unusual dimensions.Although it will be called St Patrickrsquos Festival, the steering committee believe that a Maytime date would be better favoured by the weather than one on March  and would allow them to provide a much wider range of outdoor and indoor attractions.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Stormont Minister is to be asked to prevent the extension of a caravan park near Killyleagh.The unprecedented step is being taken by Down Council in protest against a recommendation made by planners to allow the development at East Down Yacht Club. The council are unhappy about the reasons given by the planners to allow the development to proceed.NEWCASTLE mdash The International Nile Canoe Expedition mdash which includes  year-old Newcastle man Marcus Baillie mdash is making signicant progress and more than a third of the death-defying trip has been completed.Two signicant firsts have been achieved by the eight-man expedition team which has already reached Khartoum in its bid to complete the longest continuous navigation of the mighty African river.Marcus, a former Down High School pupil, is hoping to complete the harrowing journey within the next three months.No-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus, who now lives in Liverpool, admitted before he left that the trip would not be easy.Despite many warnings from locals, few crocodiles were seen and the herds of hippopotamus provide much less troublesome than the mosquitos.The team are now battling slowly northwards against a strong head wind towards the famous cataracts and Egyptrsquos Aswan.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A burst water main in the Castlewellan area brought about a dry Christmas for scores of local families.There were also fears the sudden drought could spread to Dromore and Banbridge when the water mains burst between Tullymurray and Mayobridge. Because of the work to rule action by watermen, it meant the problem was not dealt with for several days.As a result families living near Tullymurray were without water since Christmas Day.PORTAFERRY mdash Stage two of a new sewerage scheme for Portaferry is expected to get underway in May and should take four months to complete.The Department of the Environmentrsquos Eastern Division Water Service has announced that the second of three contracts is now being advertised and work will involve the construction of a pumping station.

That is absolutely true of the Downe. First class facilities are nothing without first class staff and at the Downe we are very lucky to have both, she said.Mrs Hanlon remarked: ldquoHospital staff are clearly eager to embrace the challenge of expanding services and I have no doubt that in the years to come the Downersquos reputation as a first class facility with passionate, professional staff will see services grow and develop further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Head blasts at ‘disparity’ over student allocations  ","story":"A GRAMMAR school principal has hit out at education chiefs for not equally planning for an expected increase for post-primary students.Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, says that the Department of Educationhas addressed the need for additional students in Belfast, Bangor and Londonderry by awarding some schools additional places, but has failed to address the local need for  .He has accused DENI of treating some areas in Northern Ireland dferently to others and has urged the Department to address the local problem sooner rather than later.ldquoWe know that this is a major issue waiting to happen, said Mr Dobbin.ldquoStatistics clearly show that there is a signicant number of extra girls to be accommodated across our vast catchment area and I will be left with very angry parents and pupils who are extremely unhappy with not being allocated Assumption Grammar as their preferred choice.ldquoThis would be understandableall schools in all areas were being treated the same, but this is not the case.ldquoHow can some areas be addressed proactively and then other areas neglected  This disparity and the disrespect towards the parents and children in our local area, compared to other areas, is appalling.Statistics from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency show that an increase of an average of  children in this age group in the Down district annually over the next ten years.However, last night a DENI spokesperson said that it had reviewed the anticipated shortfall and that no additional places for next year were needed in Ballynahinch.ldquoAt the end of the admissions procedure in ,  places remained available in Ballynahinch,  of which were in the denominational sector.

But no unionist politicians have been invited – a move the organisers claim is designed to rebalance the “misrepresentation” of public opinion here.At a launch event in Belfast yesterday, co-organiser Niall Murphy said representatives of “civic unionism” would be participating in  discussions and insisted the conference was open for everyone to attend.“Political unionism has set its face against rights, against progressive, inclusive politics and has misrepresented the outcome of the referendum. This jurisdiction voted to remain and that is not being appropriately represented,” the Belfast-based solicitor said.Mr Murphy, who launched the event alongside political commentator Brian Feeney, denied the movement is a front for a pro-united Ireland agenda.But UUP chief whip Steve Aiken MLA, who voted remain in the referendum, has questioned the motives of those behind the event.“The refusal of the organisers to invite unionist politicians is indicative that they have a pre-ordained agenda. It is disappointing that they have closed minds on an issue which will affect all of our people, unionist and nationalist alike,” he said.“Whether they like it or not, they will have to share this piece of land with their unionist neighbours, but that obviously doesn’t fit with their narrative. It doesn’t hold out much hope for the futurethat’s their mindset.”A TUV spokesperson said “all fair minded people” would see the conference as “a nationalist event designed to promote a nationalist agenda”.But stressing that “political unionism has now adopted a pro-Brexit position”, the organisers of the conference insist they are “encouraging all sections of opinion which are committed to a rights-based society and shared future to participate in the event.”PSNIseized files to Jamie Bryson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degCEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes falls          ..

At that point he said: “In the end you can always do a deal with an Ulsterman, but it’s not the way to run a modern, sophisticated society.”In a statement, DUP MP Gregory Campbell responded: “Standing up for the national interests of this country and working to get the best deal for all is the very antithesis of sectarianism. Ken Clarke should reflect on what he has said.”He added: “Ken Clarke, very unfortunately for him, finds himself increasingly out of step with the vast majority in his own party as well as the country. “Instead of swiping at other parties, Mr Clarke would be better served in working to find solutions, with members across the House of Commons during this crucial time to get the best deal for the United Kingdom, that would be a more fitting tribute and better accolade for the Father of the House.” Driver killed his elderly mother in crash tragedy and solicitor Niall Murphy, of Irelands Future - a collective of Irish citizens living in the region seeking to highlight the potential impact of Brexit on their rights and livelihoods, which is organising the Beyond Brexit gathering in Belfast.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There was a baby in the back and, with another man, we got the baby out.ldquoThen I went to the black car to help and realised it was the Duke of Edinburgh.AskedPhilip was trapped, Mr Warne said: ldquoYes, he was. I asked him to move his left leg and that freed his right leg and then I helped him get out.When questioned about what the duke said, he replied: ldquoI canrsquot remember, but it was nothing rude.ldquoHe was obviously shaken, and then he went and askedeveryone  was all right.Mr Warne said the duke was able to stand and walk immediately after getting out of the car, but he appeared to suggest the duke may have been cut, possibly by broken glass.ldquoThere was a little bit of blood and one of the royal entourage gave me a wipe to wipe my hands, he said.Broken glass and car parts on the side of the A near to the Sandringham Estate Buckingham Palace has said that after the accident the duke ldquosaw a doctor as a precaution and the doctor confirmed he was not injured.Commenting on the circumstances of the crash, Mr Warne added: ldquoI think therersquos no doubt that it was hit . Thatrsquos my recollection.ldquoI didnrsquot see it come from the side road, I saw it careering and tumblingacross the road and ending up on the other side.ldquoIt would take a massive forceand it had rolled on the other side as well.Askedhe meant that the Freelander had ldquorolled right over, Mr Warnesaid: ldquoYes.The duke has been spending Christmas and New Year at Sandringham with the Queen. Steve Parsons PA WireDescribing how he helped the duke from his car, Mr Warne told Today: ldquoI think I helped him out through either the sunroof or the front windscreen, but Irsquom a bit blurred about that.Mr Warne was still on the scene when the ambulance arrived, but did not hear anyone discussing whether Philip should be taken to hospital.ldquoI didnrsquot hear any discussion like that, but I was told he was taken to Sandringham House for assessment.Askedthe duke thanked him, Mr Warne said: ldquoNo, but he wasnrsquot being discourteous or anything. He had other things on his mind, Irsquom sure.Other eye witnesses have said how Philip, who retired from public duties in  but remains active, was left ldquoshocked following the accident.The Duke has remained active since retiring from public duties in  and takes a keen interest in the running of the Sandringham estate. Chris Radburn PA WireThe motorist suggested the duke may have been accompanied by an entourage in another car which is likely to have included police officers.He told Today: ldquoA lot of people arrived very quickly.Describing how he helped the occupants of the other car involved, Mr Warne said: ldquoThe person in the car behind me also stopped and a passenger from that car actually took the baby in his arms after we had freed it from the baby harness.ldquoOne of them had a broken arm. They were very shaken. One of them was the mother of the child and she was quite upset.ldquoI think therersquos no doubt that it was hit . Thatrsquos my recollection.The accident crash scene has attracted media interest. John Stillwell PA WireThe crash happened at the Babingley crossroads on a stretch of the A which runs between the town of Kingrsquos Lynn and the north Norfolk coast.It is single carriageway and has a mph speed limit.Concerns had previously been raised about road safety on the A near Sandringham.By coincidence, Norfolk County Council is scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss plans to reduce the speed limit on the road from mph to mph and install safety cameras..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Eyewitness describes Duke of Edinburgh us car  utumbling u during accident article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our position remains - this new leisure facility funded by the ratepayer should remain in council ownership and delivered by our capable and talented leisure staff.”Sectarian and hate-fuelled graffiti removed, say SDLP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingOn going incident at Craigavon HospitalPSNI say man at GP Out of Hours stand-off was lsquotaken to safetyrsquoPolice negotiating with man at GP Out of Hours stand-offDamaged roof leads to part of Craigavon shopping centre being cordoned offOutrage as dirty needles found near play area          ..

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ob_1.jpg","title":"leaders in business owen brennan","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Owen Brennan, Devenish Nutrition In , Devenish Nutrition was an agri-feed business, established in Fermanagh, with around two dozen staff.In the  years since its takeover, Owen Brennan, executive chairman with the now global company – which has its headquarters in Belfast – has grown the business from a firm with annual revenues of £m, to an international business now doing that in a week.“By the time we got there it was well-established for over  years. The shareholders were looking for somebody to take the business to the next stage.“While the company was smaller at the time, they were really keen to see it grow from the Northern Ireland base.“The business has grown substantially. At that time, the Northern Ireland revenues were over % of the entire sales. Today they are less than %.”However, Northern Ireland revenues are around five times larger than when Owen took over the business.Devenish has round  staff – across  nationalities, which is roughly the size of the entire workforce  years ago. But it counts Northern Ireland as its main base, and remains a key element of the business. The company sells into more than  countries.“The most important metric is that we spend around £m a year on innovation projects,” he said.“The big focus in  was seeing a niche opportunity for a specialised, innovative nutrition product, full-service business.”It deals in animal feed supplements – specialised high-value nutrients in a small pack. It also makes diets for small animals at the early stage of their lives, along with specialised nutritional products.And Owen says while the public hears about the negative impact of livestock, the positive impact isn’t heard.In his time at Devenish, Owen has been handed several accolades, including winning the BelfastCup  at the Ulster Farmers’ Union annual dinner.  “I’ve always taken those awards very seriously, and it’s the reflection of the work of a lot of people. I might happen to be the person that ends up being the recipient, but that’s only possible because of the success of the overall business.”He says, while sounding like a cliche it’s “genuinely a team effort”. “Part of my interestis that I see the parallels between sport and business.“Who is the most important person on the rugby field … actually, it’s everybody. If you have one weakness in that  or match-day .“If you take that analogy into the business area. I was once asked by a mentor, who did I think were the most important people in the business at that time. I said I didn’t know.“But he said ‘the telephone receptionist and the lorry driver’. He said those two people, between them, have by far and away the most customer contact in our business. I’ve never forgotten that. And  years later, I find that to be true.”On Brexit, Owen says the position among businesses has remained consistent, with a majority opposed to the UK leaving the EU.“The three things which have emerged to date include the diminution in the value of sterling – that has been a very bad thing for business, generally.“… the second effect has been uncertainty… le is uncertain, as is business. But anything that adds a large uncertainty in a business environment is not good.“The third is maybe a little harder to define. I think the debate around this leaves a lot to be desired. “People have said to me that the focus on immigration has made a lot of people, that would be described in those debates as immigrants, feeling very uncomfortable.“We are an international business, and had got to used to thinking of that international dimension as a good and wholly positive thing, so to hear a debate with that emphasis, with that sort of connotation for people of an international background.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gibsn_1.jpg","title":"outlook  the year ahead has forecasting ever been harder","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Professor Neil Gibson, chief economist at EY Ireland says in two decades in the field, predicting the future has never been harder Forecasting is always a challenge but, in  years as a professional economist, I have never had less confidence in predicting the year ahead than I do now.  At the time of writing, the nature of the UK’s departure from the EU remains unclear. Estimates of the economic impact of ious exit scenarios ranged from -% in a catastrophic exit .Notably, all of the iants suggested a loss of GDP in the UK, though it also worth noting that GDP means virtually nothing to most of the voting public.  The prediction of % loss in house prices in the disorderly scenario is much more likely to focus minds. Moreover, Brexit is far from the only uncertainty ahead.  Trade wars are continuing, oil prices are slumping and stock markets are incredibly volatile. Many of the global warning lights have flicked from green to amber and it is entirely possible that  will be a very challenging year indeed. Despite the gloomy introduction, the base case forecasts continue to suggest a year of modest growth ahead. EY predicts a small contraction in the local labour market but most other forecasters disagree. This base case projection assumes a transition period is in place and that a global slow-down does not materialise:  two rather large assumptions to make. The optimism is partly borne out of what has been a remarkable period of job growth in Northern Ireland. The workforce jobs measure reports , net additional jobs have been created in the year to Q . This continues a trend that started in  and has seen the overall employment level rise by , since Q . This is despite very modest levels of recorded GDP growth and, finally, it has taken the region back above the total employment levels reached in . This performance is a credit to businesses throughout the region as, remarkably, all council areas have enjoyed job growth and all sectors outside of public administration have increased their headcounts since Q . The consumer is, perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the economy heading into . Inflation is running very close to UK average salary increases, which means that, on average, people are not getting richer. However, overall consumer spending has been rising – partly because there are more people in work and partly because people have been willing to run down savings or take on debt.The data shows NI to be particularly vulnerable in this regard, with higher proportions of people without savings . The fragile state of the economy means,  probably, that interest rate increases are unlikely, especially with falling oil prices easing inflation, but the impact of a change in consumer sentiment and spending behaviour would trigger a marked slow-down. Consumer confidence measures are inherently volatile but there are reasons to be concerned. Confidence surveys have been edging downwards – the UK credit conditions surveys suggest a tightening amongst lenders in  and savings ratiosare at historic lows. Consumer trends should be watched closely in early  as they will prove critical to overall economic performance. TRENDS TO WATCH IN There are a number of economic trends I would expect to see in :Continued retail transformation: it has been a dficult time on the high street as consumers move increasingly to on-line shopping. A number of high profile closures have taken a toll and we expect this pattern to continue.  This will, as all periods of change do, create winners and losers and will  place pressure further on an outdated rates system that relies heavily on retailing. Embracing digital: the potential that new forms of technology presents has been clear for some time. Articial intelligence, blockchain, software as a service , data analyticshave long been touted as potential game changers. There has been a marked pick-up over the last  months in firms making investments in these areas. Maturing of the technologies and a tighter labour market are factors in these trends and we expect that to continue in . Pockets of growth: regardless of the wider economic conditions, there will continue to be pockets of very fast growth throughout Northern Ireland. The pipeline of professional services inward investment remains strong, in particular with US firms seeking talent a noticeable trend. Media and film continues to boom and, even on the high street, there is no sign of a slowdown in the proleration of coffee shops, personal wellbeing businesses and take away outlets. Volatility: share prices and exchange rates are likely to be incredibly ‘spikey’ given the turbulence in the world economy. Summary – beating the forecasters The Northern Ireland economy’s labour market has surprised me over the past  months. I hope that it continues to outperform expectations in .  Hopefully, there will be a transition period in place with a clear roadmap to a future free trade agreement between the EU and UK which may prevent the scale of slow-down I worry may be coming. While on the subject of wish-casting, let us hope that the Executive is back and operating too in . If all these pieces fall into place then next year’s outlook for  will be much easier to write.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
