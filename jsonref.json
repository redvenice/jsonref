However, there was a time when a man’s presence would have been unusual, or even frowned upon.According to midwife, nurse and author Mark Harris, the prevailing culture of the time saw men separated from the birthing space, although ironically, it’s in his innate nature to protect it.He said: ‘In the 1950s, there was the whole idea of a nuclear family, an idea that’s swimming in patriarchy.’It wasn’t until the 1970s that males participated in the birthing experience. Indeed, men couldn’t even train as midwives until then.Harris, who offers a birthing education programme called Birthing4Blokes, added: ‘The shift to men being present in the birthing room was driven by women’s requests and the idea it would solidify relationships.’French obstetrician Michel Odent, who tirelessly campaigned for more natural birthing practices and techniques, coined this sea change the ‘industrialisation of birth’.Men’s participation in birthing is the stuff of both hilarity and horror.Harris relays the behaviour of some men as their partner groans and grimaces their way through agonising contractions.According to him, ‘One man was watching House Of Cards on an iPad, another head-butted a paediatrician. Some even flirt with midwives.’He gives the example of Robbie Williams, who danced around while live-tweeting the birth of his second child to wife Ayda Field.‘It’s an evolutionary driven response, an escape mechanism,’ according to Harris. ‘A man is governed by testosterone so he goes into fight or flight mode. His role is to protect the birthing space and fight off predators.’(Picture: Ella Byworth for )Many men will choose to be there for their partner, even if the idea turns their stomach. But if you’re a man reading this, know that a woman will know if your heart isn’t in it.‘The woman won’t be able to give into what is happening,’ according to Harris. ‘She’ll be distracted by mothering her partner, which is going to kill her oxytocin levels that she needs to get her through labour.’Another reason men give is that it being ‘at the business end’ will diminish sexual desire.Gordon Ramsay chose not to be there at the birth of his four children, worried that he’d be forever scarred by images of ‘skinned rabbits and conger eels’, while Robbie Williams joked that watching a baby emerge from his wife’s vagina was ‘like watching your favourite pub burn down’.For many men though, it’s a really great experience.Harris explained: ‘I’ve seen hundreds of men – bouncers and military men – dissolve into tears. They’re impacted in a positive way.’Interestingly, Harris says some men develop PTSD post-birth, a phenomenon called labourless trauma, which happens because their sense of control is stripped away.Whether or not a man chooses to be there, according to Harris, ‘The best decisions are made in discussions. Listen to what each other’s fears are. Be where your partner wants you to be. You can still be there without physically being there.’So menfolk, give in to your evolutionary urges and do what feels natural as your amazing partner brings a new life into the world. Although live-tweeting said birth might get you punched.MORE: I’m turning 40 and I can’t drive, but I’m determined to learnMORE: I hated football but my first Premier League game changed all thatMORE: Flexible working and the gig economy: Why it’s a nightmare for new parents"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/pri_62388887.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"hundreds swingers attempting largest orgy human history","story":"(Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for )Swingers are going to attempt to break the world record for the ‘largest orgy in human history’.Menage Life, an organisation for ‘sexually free people’ are organising the mammoth feat, inviting ‘you all to cum’ down to their Sin City event in Las Vegas on Saturday 2 June.They’re expecting more than a thousand swingers to come down and get stuck in.If that many turn up, they’ll be well on their way to the record as it stands, Japan holds the record for the ‘biggest orgy ever’, which took place in 2007 and involved 500 people having sex in a ‘pretty hot and sticky’ warehouse.You can buy footage of that particular party on DVD but Menage Life is aiming much higher.To attend, you’ve got to buy a Sin City 8 pass, which cost around £145 for couples or £18 for a single woman.On arrival, you’ll be given a load of condoms, lube, hand towels and hand sanitizer, and the company promises to provide a clean and comfortable space with clearly marked areas for waste and linen disposal.And to avoid people being outed for taking part, everyone will be provided with a mask or is welcome to bring their own costumes.But if you’re just a horny single dude looking to make history, we have disappointing news: ‘no unescorted males are allowed at the event’.‘Because of possible media attention, we are making the world record attempt a masquerade, a very erotic masquerade’, the team write.‘Cum be part of history. Feel free to bring your own toys and supplies too.’Good luck to one and all.MORE: Would you allow your baby to be swung by the neck in the name of ‘healing’?MORE: How many working days are there in a year and how to work it out"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/image-203.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"it looks like the united kingdom has a voting block of its own at eurovision","story":"UK, Australia and Ireland could all exchange a few points at EurovisionFor the first time ever, all three English language nations at the Eurovision Song Contest will compete in the Grand Final. Australia made it to the Eurovision final for a fourth year in a row after Jessica Mauboy nailed her performance of We Got Love. Ireland is back for the first time in five years with Ryan O’Shaughnessy taking Together through from the first semi-final.This means, that alongside the Nordic block, the former Yugoslavian block, the former Soviet Block, the English language block has a presence in this year’s Eurovision Final. That old trope that ‘no-one likes us’ and that we don’t have friends is dead and buried!Both Australia and Ireland have sent points to the United Kingdom in recent years and we might see those ties strengthened again this year. Could it be that the United Kingdom is no longer at a disadvantage when it comes to the voting?Whilst many in the United Kingdom bemoan the usual 12-point swap between Greece and Cyprus, we often forget that the United Kingdom and Ireland have swapped votes a fair bit and Australia’s addition to the competition gives us a better power-base.Last year, 25 countries awarded points to the United Kingdom. The Australian jury gave us a maximum 12 points. The United Kingdom gave 10 points to Australia.

Indeed, he claims to have won an award for Best Gay Solo Video in 1997. Rex uses the reclining naked photograph on his Twitter home page where he also likes to post crude jokes. In a reference to engagement rings, he wrote the other day: ‘The bigger the diamond, the smaller the d***.’Elsewhere there is a picture of him posing in a Coca-Cola costume carrying the caption: ‘I think I have a coke problem.’All in all, he seems the unlikeliest of romances for Ms Markle. But according to the Sun newspaper, the two enjoyed a date in 2004 when Meghan was 22 and taking her very first steps as a professional actress with walk-on parts in daytime television.          Simon Rex of Dirt Nasty performs at the world famous Roxy theater in Los Angeles, CA          Simon \u0027Dirt Nasty\u0027 Rex (centre) arrives at the grand opening of the Sapphire Pool \u0026amp Day Club on May 3, 2013 in Las Vegas, NevadaThey are said to have met on the set of a long-forgotten U.S. sitcom called Cuts when they both had roles in the same episode.He was already a successful model appearing in ads for Calvin Klein, Versace and Levi’s while Meghan was still a year away from her first regular-money role as a ‘briefcase girl’ — holding up a case full of cash — on game show Deal Or No Deal.Of his past as a porn star — he was 18 and 19 when he made the films — he says it was to pay the bills.‘I went there and did that s***,’ he said in a 2014 interview. ‘It was just enough to pay the rent at the time. I was living in the moment.’He added: ‘In hindsight, it wasn’t the best move.’For Meghan, Rex’s moment of regret will barely register. Instead, any lingering hopes she may have had that her past life would remain off limits as she completes her transformation from Hollywood starlet to royal princess must surely now have vanished.If it’s any comfort, the Royal Family will scarcely raise an eyebrow at the revelations. As one figure close to the Royals told me: ‘It’s a horrid little betrayal, but it won’t damage her reputation. She’s not a virginal bride like Diana, who was only just out of her teens when she married Charles, but a mature woman of experience with one failed marriage behind her.’  Paris Hilton and Simon Rex at the premiere of the \u0027Layer Cake\u0027 film in January 2005 (left). Paris Hilton and Simon Rex on the set of Pledge This! in Miami, Florida in August 2004The disclosures have come from Ninaki Priddy, once an inseparable friend of Meghan to whom she had been ‘like a sister’. But their relationship is long over. Since Meghan’s engagement to Harry she has spilled just about every intimate bean of their 30-year friendship.It was Ms Priddy, you may recall, who revealed to royal biographer Andrew Morton that Meghan ‘was always fascinated by the Royal Family. She wants to be Princess Diana 2.’ Yet what emerges from these revelations is a picture of Meghan who, as a young woman, was not quite the confident and sophisticated figure whom Harry fell in love with. Meghan was vulnerable and as likely as any other twentysomething to chance her luck in the dating stakes.Until now it had been thought that, for all her beauty, Meghan had been linked to only a handful of men, apart from her former husband, film producer Trevor Engelson and the Canadian chef who replaced him in her affections.There had been the boy with whom she shared a first kiss, a high-school sweetheart, and a couple of others, none serious. But now we learn that she had a dating bible called The Rules, a self-help book aimed at women who want ‘marriage in the shortest time possible’. Meghan studied the book — an instant bestseller when it came out in the mid-Nineties — so thoroughly she was able to recite passages off by heart.    Interestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capitalInterestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capital.Looking back, it does seem these men were little more than footfalls in her romantic history. By 2004, she was with TV producer Engelson. In 2010, they were engaged and wed the following year, to separate two years later.Ms Priddy claims that her friend had put ‘all The Rules into play with Trevor’.She had apparently met a fortune teller in Argentina who told her she would marry a man with ‘curly red hair’. Engelson, of course is not the only figure in her life to have reddish hair. So, too, does Prince Harry.Next week she will have pushed the far-from-welcome disclosures to the back of her mind as family and friends see them marry.Her old friend Ninaki will not be there. She did not make the guest list.  The rule book secrets that helped her bewitch a Prince For every young girl who dreams of growing up and marrying a handsome Prince, there is one burning question. How did Meghan do it?Just how did this 36-year-old American orcee and small-screen actress capture the eye of Prince Harry?Now we know the answer. One of her childhood friends, Ninaki Priddy, this week said Meghan swore by a self-help book called The Rules: Time-tested Secrets For Capturing The Heart Of Mr Right.Although a bestseller, the book came in for criticism over its anti-feminist message. It advises women to be subservient, let the man to lead the conversation and to never, ever sleep with him until you’ve had at least three dates.There’s also a chapter on how to attract a high-profile man — along with other rules Meghan may have found useful . . .SNARING YOUR VIPWhat follows are The Rules for meeting and dating celebrities and business bigwigs. Assuming the VIP spoke to you first, here’s what to do and what not to do:1. Take a deep breath. Stay composed.2. Treat him as you would any other man, not the movie star or business tycoon he is.3. Do not stare at him4. Do not light up or act giddy, as if you just won the lottery.5. Act as if you’ve been out of the country for the last three years and you’re not quite sure who he is, even if he was just on the cover of People magazine.6. Don’t ask for his autograph.7. Don’t compliment him.8. Don’t show any interest in his career.9. If you’re an aspiring actress, do not ask for an audition.10. Do not ask him to do you a favour, such as donate money to your favourite charity.11. Act interested but not spellbound. Leave him alone. After five minutes of conversation about whatever he wants to talk about, say: ‘Oh, look at the time, I must leave now. It was nice meeting you.’ And walk away.12. Do not seem impressed by his limousine or entourage.13. Once you are dating a celebrity, don’t see him whenever and wherever it’s convenient for him because he has a busy schedule. 14. It’s tempting to drop your friends and family and revolve your whole life around this famous man. You must still live your own life, see him two to three times a week — until he proposes.15. If he’s widely popular, expect that other women might write to him, call him and throw themselves at him. Do not get angry or show jealousy or insecurity. Do not be possessive in public. If he pursued you, their advances won’t matter. He’ll still want you.16. Be discreet. Do not call the tabloids and tell them you’re dating, as a way of announcing to other women that he’s your man. That would be self-serving, possibly hurtful or embarrassing to him, and might ruin any chances of his continuing to see you.17. Don’t try to become too friendly with his staff in an effort to keep tabs on him or so they put in a good word for you.18. Don’t seem overly interested in his wealth or the limelight. Rules girls are not groupies.DON’T RUSH INTO SEXYou will have to exercise a bit of self-restraint and trust that if you hold off for a few weeks or months you won’t be sorry. Why risk having a man call you easy?It can be excruciating to put off sex with someone you’re attracted to but you must think long-term.Let’s say that now, hopefully, you’ve held off for a while and are ready to have sex with him.What Rules should you follow? First and foremost, stay emotionally cool no matter how hot the sex gets. The fact is that most women turn men off not only because they sleep with them too soon, but because they talk too much about it in bed.Don’t be a drill sergeant, demanding he do that or this. Being with you in bed should not be difficult or demanding.Don’t cling to him if he has to leave that night or the following morning.Be casual and unmoved about the fact the date is over — with that attitude chances are that he’ll be the one hanging on.LONG-DISTANCE LOVEHaving been introduced to someone who lives in a different city or country, Rules apply to making it work:Don’t call him. He calls you. Get off the phone in 20 minutes. If he wants to visit you on the weekend, he must ask you by Wednesday.If he suggests that you meet in his city, or halfway, say: ‘That sounds nice, but things are really hectic right now, I just couldn’t get away.’ He’ll realise that he has to visit you. If you travel to see him before he’s made at least three trips to see you, he won’t think you’re special, and will not pursue you in the future. The first three times he visits, he should not stay with you. The first three visits are really three dates . . . and on the first three dates we don’t have sex.The first three times, always see a little less of him than he would like. If he suggests flying in Friday night and leaving Sunday evening, say Saturday morning would be better and end on Sunday afternoon.After he has visited you three times, you can visit him once and stay at his place. If he offers to pay your travel costs, let him. If he doesn’t, don’t ask for the money but let him pay for everything when you’re there. If things get serious, he might ask if you would ever consider relocating.Until he actually gives you a ring, be vague. There’s no reason to relocate until you’ve set a wedding date.CLOSING THE DEALIf you have been following the Rules you will not only get a proposal but you will know where the relationship is going long before he pops the question. You will sense a warm, open feeling emanating from him, a desire to include you in his world.The way to get a man to ask you to marry him in a reasonable amount of time is not to live with him before you’re engaged, and to continue to see him only three times a week. There’s no cold feeling in Rules engagements. He’s made his decision, he wants to get married, to be with you all the time, for ever.The Complete Book Of Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider published by Thorson Element at £9.99 © Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider 2000."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/22/4C11A25600000578-0-image-a-7_1525988920330.jpg","title":"Duke Edinburgh attend Prince Harrys wedding ditched crutches","story":"    The 96-year-old Duke of Edinburgh has ditched his crutches two weeks after his surgery, ahead of Harry and Meghan\u0027s big dayPrince Philip has recovered from his hip operation just in time to go the Royal wedding.The 96-year-old Duke of Edinburgh has ditched his crutches two weeks after his surgery, ahead of Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day on May 19.To ensure he can stand without the aid of a stick on the big day, the royal has been walking up and down stairs to build up his strength.A source told The Sun: \u0027The Duke is already walking unaided.\u0027He has amazing willpower. \u0027When he sets his mind to something he gets on and does it.\u0027\u0027He has been walking up and down stairs several times in succession.\u0027He has also been charging across rooms at full speed.

The Three Little Pigs was the second most heavily changed fairytale by UK parents \u0027Not only that, but when you think about the storylines, some can be considered very scary for little children.\u0027  The research, conducted for musicMagpie by OnePoll.com, also found three quarters of parents read their children bedtime stories, spending an average of 17 minutes on each story time.But while 85 per cent read from a physical book, almost one in 10 will read from the tablet and one in twenty listen to spoken stories on the TV.An inventive 18 per cent of parents even make up their own tales to entertain their children at bedtime.Of those who don\u0027t read to their children, one in five parents claim they are too busy, with ten percent admitting they would rather give them a tablet or audio book to listen to before bed.Others let them watch TV instead (15 per cent), say their children don\u0027t enjoy reading stories (25 per cent) or lack confidence in their own reading abilities (15 per cent).Despite this, 97 per cent of parents think it is important to read to their children.

Cliche has long since reduced much of what occurred to “student revolt”, but that hardly does these happenings justice, partly because it ignores the workers’ strikes that were just as central to what occurred during ’68 and the years that followed, but also because the phrase gets nowhere near the depth and breadth of what young people were rebelling against, not least in France.This was the last time that a developed western society glimpsed the possibility of revolution focused not just on institutions, but the contestation of everyday reality, which is still enough to make the simple phrase “May 1968” crackle with excitement – even if you were not around when les évenéments took place. I was born in 1969, but what happened in France and beyond retains a magnetic allure.To mark 1968’s 50th anniversary, Christian Dior and Gucci have respectively launched a celebratory collection and ’68-themed ad campaign, proof if any were needed that the year’s legacy has been commodified in a way that plenty of its agitators and thinkers would have seen coming. But there are also more cerebral commemorations: a series of events, focused on liberties and utopias, at Nanterre University, the suburban campus where the French unrest first flared up and at King’s College in London, workshops, film screenings and symposiums on ’68’s protests and what they have come to signify.The leftwing publishers Verso are reissuing a handful of texts, including Tariq Ali’s memoir-cum-history Street Fighting Years and the Raymond Williams-edited May Day Manifesto (1968), arguably the founding text of the British New Left. The same company is also publishing a new book titled Opening the Gates, the compelling story of an attempt at co-operative socialism that took root in the early 1970s at a watch factory in eastern France. Allen Lane, meanwhile, has published The Long ’68, by British historian Richard Vinen, an exhaustive work whose narrative runs across Europe and the US. By a neat historical coincidence, these commemorations happen just as France experiences one of its characteristic spasms of ision and protest. Railway workers are in the midst of three months of rolling strikes, against President Macron’s plans to introduce his country’s transport system to competition and new labour arrangements. At the same time, students are protesting against plans to make university entrance more selective, and proposed changes to the baccalaureate exam system.Thirty years ago, the 20th anniversary of 1968 was the focus of a fortnight-long season on Channel 4, which included a Jean-Luc Godard movie, the three-hour film of 1969’s Woodstock festival and a smattering of documentaries. This was some people’s introduction to a huge historical moment that had rather been forgotten. The members of a Mancunian rock group called the Stone Roses were captivated by footage of one young Parisian, as guitarist John Squire recalled, “chucking stones, with a really nice jacket and desert boots”. They wrote a hymn of cross-generational admiration titled “Bye Bye Badman”, which took its place on an album whose sleeve featured the French tricolour and three slices of lemon – a reference to the fact that the latter had been used in Paris to nullify the effects of tear gas. Meanwhile, others, like me, programmed their VHS recorders for the wee hours and amassed their own ’68 archive.If your mind was ever open to that year’s mixture of subversion and confrontation, it will probably have stuck with you. Most of the time, mundane reality wins out, but from time to time, an explosive critique of modernity bursts through and demands action, even if it just as quickly recedes. This, perhaps, is the essential story of 1968 and its enduring legacy.The book is objective and factual: his sources include police reports and dispatches filed from Paris by British diplomats, but his text still conveys a sense of events so convulsive and all-encompassing that they exude a deeply romantic sense of ordinary reality somehow being suspended. As Vinen recounts, an initial confrontation between students and the authorities at the Nanterre campus – partly over restrictions on male-female living arrangements – spread to the Latin Quarter, and by some process of cause and effect almost impossible to explain, led in turn to a general strike that soon involved 10 million people. “It looked likely that De Gaulle, who had ruled France for 10 years, would fall,” he writes. But this was only the start:“For a couple of weeks, the country seemed to hover on the edge of some kind of revolution – though no one really knew what kind. The leaders of the Communist party, which had been talking about revolution for 50 years, were mystified by, and usually hostile to, the student protest. All sorts of groups were touched by the apocalyptic mood.“There were working-class protests all over the world, but this huge concentration of a general strike in May ’68 was specific to France,” he says. Herein lies an element of the story that the foregrounding of students has sidelined: a restive mood among industrial workers, which he partly puts down to the fact that large swathes of France only began to industrialise after the second world war. “You had a group of workers who’d come into industrial work relatively recently and had never accepted its disciplines and structures, or the disciplines of their trade unions,” he explains. “The other country where that was true was Italy.”The Italian “Hot Autumn” of 1969 was fictionalised in We Want Everything, a 1971 novel by the Italian author Nanni Balestrini, only published in English in 2014. Telling the story of a discontented worker at Fiat’s vast Mirafiori factory in Turin, it captures the mood in Italy during the “Cassa del Mezzogiorno”, the postwar attempt by the Italian government to bring industry to the deprived south of the country.The failure of that effort fed into a revolt against something much more fundamental: work itself, and a regimented, bureaucratic vision of life pushed by both the left and right. Towards the end of the book, there is a speech:The sense of a malaise unanswered by politics defined the spirit of ’68 across the world. As workers and students saw it, communism – whether in central and eastern Europe, or the communist parties in the west – was as much of a blight as capitalism, something vividly illustrated by that year’s so-called Prague spring, and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. More generally, the traditional leftist idea that the state could be the bringer of liberation was dramatically undermined by a widespread conviction that traditional power structures were so problematic as to be almost useless. This latter idea runs through 1968 in the form of a vivid leitmotif: ranks of police – in Paris, London, Chicago – charging at crowds of young protesters.Among the best films about 1968 and its meaning is A Grin Without a Cat, by the French director Chris Marker, and one of its most compelling moments comes during a sequence dedicated to the unrest in Paris. “All of a sudden, the state reveals its repressive side, the one which is more or less diluted in daily life,” says the narrator. “But now, it has to make a show of strength. And to do so, it sends in the police force, with all kinds of gear and contraptions you didn’t know existed. Fine: for the demonstrator, the state appears as a vision, like the Virgin Mary at Fatima. It’s a revelation.”Power, and the eternal human tendency to try to negate it: such has been the story of wildly erse revolts, from the first stirrings of punk rock to the Occupy movement. The latter was criticised for its lack of specific demands, but this missed the point. “What we have in the United States is an oligarchy and what we need is a people’s democracy,” said one protester at Occupy Wall Street. “So we’re occupying this country. We start out at Wall Street, then we spread out and occupy the country and take it back.” Perhaps unwittingly, he was following a famous edict that had been daubed on to a Parisian wall in 1968: “Be reasonable – demand the impossible.”Hari’s Kunzru’s 2007 novel My Revolutions centres on a character, Chris Carver, who is changed forever by the events of 1968. He takes part in sit-ins at the LSE, the famous anti-Vietnam demonstration outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square, and then becomes one of the core members of a group who move from direct action to terrorism.There are echoes here of the German Red Army Faction, otherwise known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, but the basis of the story is the Angry Brigade, the London-based group who cut their teeth in the midst of 1968’s tumult. From the summer of 1970 onwards, against a background of rising industrial strife, the Angry Brigade launched a series of bomb attacks whose targets included the embassies of far‑right regimes, the home secretary’s house and the Miss World competition. (In 2002, a journalist from the Observer interviewed the former Angry Brigade member Hilary Creek, who briskly captured the contexts of what she had been involved in: “Basically, I’m not ashamed of anything I have done, going from the student protests at Essex to the organisation for the Vietnam war demonstrations, squatting and the early women’s movement. Some of the things we did I am proud of and we still see the effects now.”)Kunzru is a perfect example of someone who came of age long after ’68, but was dazzled from a distance. “Thatcher got into power when I was nine and the Tories left when I was 27,” he says. “So the idea of living your young life at a time when you believed that everything was about to change and you were on the brink of remaking the world was almost unimaginably distant.” There was also, he felt, a job to be done writing about ’68 and its aftershocks in terms of moral and political complexity, because “there was so little written about what happened back then that wasn’t in the service of mythmaking”.“I was writing in the early years of the war on terror,” he explains. “The question of radicalisation was on everyone’s minds. I wanted to write a book about how you go about deciding to use violence in support of your political beliefs.”The main characters in My Revolutions shape their view of the world into an exacting, almost neurotically judgmental sensibility, which captures how much the thinking of some ’68 activists marked a clean break with the live-and-let-live mores of the hippies. In one passage, Carver and a character called Anna go to a chi-chi party in north London. She says:“Look at these people. Look at them, Chris. They’re blind. They’re happy to ignore everything around them, just pleased to be having a good time. And, as far as I’m concerned, that makes them culpable. It makes them complicit in everything they’re ignoring. Vietnam, the lot. It makes them pigs.”The scene is redolent of another Parisian graffito: “To call in question the society you live in, you must first be capable of calling yourself in question.” Later in the book, Kunzru’s characters act this demand out with the aid of LSD:Anna told Leo she didn’t really think he believed in building the revolution and Leo defended himself and made a counter-accusation and gradually we were all drawn in, putting one another to the question, everyone an inquisitor. Kunzru says this scene drew on the kind of ritualised self-criticism practised by Maoists, and by the American violent protest group the Weather Underground (or “Weathermen”), whose activities decisively began in October 1969 and lasted well into the 1970s. But the scene makes a wider point about one of the plotlines of the years after ’68: the way that revolutionary zeal tends to burn out, and the fact that radical left politics has an tendency to sooner or later turn inwards.Even during ’68 itself, the revolt quickly dissipated, symbolised by De Gaulle’s landslide win in legislative elections, and by the arrival in the White House of Richard Nixon in the following year. So what of ’68’s essential spirit endures? “In the long term,” says Vinen, “it helped create a new kind of left. Partly a less economic left in some ways, a less working-class left. I think in Britain, there are a lot of ways that ’68 fed through into a leftwing Labour party in the 1980s, but also a lot of ways in which the left was rethought, some of which ended up in New Labour. In all countries, there’s a sense that it ties in with a left that involves new kinds of issues: things which may not be very important in ’68 itself, but became important – feminism, gay rights, environmentalism. That’s one part of its legacy.”Another small but vital literary and political legacy centred on two immensely powerful books. Although it was first published in 1967, Guy Debord’s The Society of the Spectacle became the key text that conveyed the profound critique of modernity that motivated some of ’68’s most imaginative rebels. In the age of Facebook, fake news and the sense that our online lives have taken precedence over real existence, it has an amazingly prophetic aspect, evident in its opening sentences: “The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. All that once was directly lived has become mere representation.”Its companion piece is The Revolution of Everyday Life, written by Raoul Vaneigem, a forceful voice in Debord’s organisation the Situationist International. Among this text’s insights is an attack on the supposed importance of work that chimes with a 21st-century conversation sparked by automation: “In an industrial society which confuses work and productivity,” Vaneigem wrote, “the necessity of producing has always been an enemy of the desire to create.”The ideology captured in these books has long been a kind of ghost within western culture and politics, periodically making itself known at moments of crisis and contestation. In late 2011, the writer and activist Paul Mason watched this happen in the wake of student protests at the Conservative party’s London HQ, when what he called a “makeshift anarchism” was afoot, and plans were forming for a new action. “The posters proclaiming this new demonstration … had begun to borrow the imagery of Paris ’68,” he wrote, in Why It’s Kicking off Everywhere. “But since Marx is out of fashion, and Lenin and Mao have been branded left fascists, who else is there to study but the Frenchman whose musings have become required reading in the era of Lady Gaga: Guy Debord?” When people who had come of political age around this time were drawn into a new Labour party by Jeremy Corbyn, their links to the politics of 40 years before quickly became clear. These newcomers have cohered into an imaginative, questioning tendency whose gatherings, which grew out of Momentum and take place alongside the Labour party conference each year, go under the very ’68ish title The World Transformed.Clearly, then, even at 50 years’ distance, the ideas at the heart of 1968’s events live on. “Their brave utopianism and their willingness to think outside the terms they were given – that’s an intellectual legacy we can still draw on,” says Kunzru. “The way the language of capital has robbed us of our dignity as citizens is something we can fight with the intellectual tools they gave us.” His point brings to mind yet another Parisian graffito, arguably even more relevant to our time than it was to the era when it was written: “Are you a consumer or a participant?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d637280414c132b76dbb0fc8a8d0d4547b9633c6/0_646_2560_1535/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab84de5b7e2a9b47ef965c3f64b95ad","title":"britains richest hedge fund manager mike platt sunday times rich list","story":"Tory donor and art collector Mike Platt has boosted his fortune by £600m in a yearMike Platt, a Preston-born financier who started investing at the age of 14 with a £500 gift from his grandmother, has been named Britain’s richest hedge fund manager with a £3bn fortune.Platt, 49, the co-founder and chief executive of Belgravia-based BlueCrest capital management, has increased his wealth by £600m over the past year to retain his crown as the richest hedge fund manager, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Platt, who claims to have never suffered an annual loss, spends a lot of his wealth on art, which he displays in the crypt of a deconsecrated church in Marylebone. The collection includes a black Christ in an electric chair beside skulls, stags’ heads, 5bn-year-old meteorites, a Japanese woman riding a walrus and the levitation of St John the Baptist. There are pieces by the taxidermist Polly Morgan, the Turner prize-winner Keith Tyson and Reece Jones.A Tory party donor, Platt also owns a Bombardier Challenger private jet and homes in London, Switzerland and the US. His first investments, funded by his grandmother, were in Britain’s privatised utilities. The second richest UK hedge fund manager is Robert Miller and his daughter, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, who increased their wealth by £420m to £2bn. Miller, the co-founder of the Duty Free Shoppers (DFS) chain, invests his family fortune via the Hong Kong-based hedge fund Search Investment Group. Sir Michael Hintze, who runs CQS, is ranked third with a £1.4bn fortune. Hintze, who gave £1.5m to the Conservative party in 2014, increased his wealth by £100m. However, the personal wealth of David Harding, another philanthropic hedge fund manager, fell by £300m to £1bn after profits at his fund Winton Capital halved to £107.3m. The top 20 UK hedge fund managers are collectively worth more than £16bn.Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, which is published this weekend, said: “The recent volatility of global stock markets have provided opportunities for the City’s richest hedgies to gild their wealth. “But life as a billionaire hedge fund manager is not a one-way bet. Four big names of the hedge fund world have seen big falls in their wealth over the past year. Managers tend to invest heavily in their funds, so if their fund bombs so does their own wealth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75cada7028d43d7a0e42ca0cb47a6376a82216c4/0_180_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90556ab0b61c8db6ff4ef5710e1763e1","title":"after metoo disinviting monica lewinsky is old fashioned misogyny","story":"Town \u0026amp Country magazine’s withdrawal of an invitation after Bill Clinton accepted was plain rude – and bad party-planningHow would you feel if you were invited to a party and then told not to come because someone you had a relationship with decades ago was going to be attending? A quarter century is long enough for most of us to be civil in those circumstances. But the event planners at Town \u0026amp Country magazine seemingly didn’t have faith that Monica Lewinsky would be capable of acting like a mature adult in that situation. They disinvited her from an event this week after they found out that Bill Clinton was also planning to attend.The party hosts were also not smart enough to remember that it’s a long time since Lewinsky has been silent in the fact of insults. On Wednesday, she took to Twitter and wrote: “Dear world: please don’t invite me to an event (esp one about social change) and – then after i’ve accepted – uninvite me because bill clinton then decided to attendwas invited. it’s 2018. emily post would def not approve.” When it comes to self-preservation, Lewinsky is a model to us all. After some difficult years following her affair with Bill Clinton, she has emerged as a crucial spokesperson against bullying and shame. That Lewinsky did not perish under the weight under hundreds of thousands of critical, mocking cable news stories and late-night comedy gags is an achievement in itself.Lewinsky is the rare media pariah to not just survive, but to use her notoriety for good. In particular, in the post-#MeToo era, she’s cast a light on how her treatment by the media in the 1990s was a monstrous exercise in misogyny: “The wholesale dissection of a young, unknown woman – me – who, due to legal quarantine, was unable to speak out on her own behalf”. Though Lewinsky takes pains to note that her relationship with the president was consensual, it was also “a giant abuse of power”. And yet, in the context of the Town \u0026amp Country soiree, Lewinsky and not Clinton became the persona non grata. It’s as if a magazine that celebrates the rococo country homes of the rich and famous didn’t get the memo about what people think about sexual misconduct in 2018.“We apologize to Ms Lewinsky and regret the way the situation was handled,” Town \u0026amp Country said the morning after, a classic sorry-but-not-sorry approach: the passive voice, the distancing from responsibility by calling it handled. And what was the situation, in any case? Two people who had a consensual relationship two decades ago were going to be at the same party? That didn’t need “handling”, beyond perhaps a double check of the seating chart. Good manners would assume that two adults in that situation would have the capacity of ignoring each other if they happened to find themselves in the same queue for the bar. Alas, this was just a case of old-fashioned misogyny: of protecting a man from the evidence of his past extramarital misdeeds rather than respecting the humanity, and prompt RSVP, of a woman. That’s just plain rude. But it’s also plain bad party-planning. An articulate and resilient woman makes a better companion than a man who preys on his intern any night of the week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c62c023e4d530bc7a6956d89ea0564ac6547464b/137_69_4093_2456/master/4093.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee3462cdb43cb852eee00ff0b5026aa","title":"grammar schools dont work tories socially regressive","story":"This morning, not for the first (or the last) time, I had to be patiently reminded not to rant and rave at the radio while taking a shower. The trigger? The government’s announcement that it was bunging an extra 50 million quid at grammar schools that wanted to expand. It’s the ultimate zombie policy. Just when you think the 11-plus is, if not finally dead and buried, then at least quarantined, it’s rising from the grave once again.What explains its survival? After all, the internet reliably informs me that there are plenty of ways to actually kill a zombie. By the same token, a quick search on Google and its pointy-headed sister site, Google Scholar, throws up decades worth of research that comprehensively debunks the claims of 11-plus fans that it improves aggregate outcomes and boosts social mobility. And this research has been replicated in more publicly accessible forums by blogs and thinktanks (even right-leaning thinktanks) and journalists, most obviously the indefatigable Chris Cook of the BBC.The only explanation is a toxic combination of nostalgia and ideology that the Tory party (and its erstwhile outside toilet, Ukip) seems unable to shake off . This is in spite of the fact that it was a Conservative education minister, Edward Boyle, who effectively gave the green light for the replacement of grammars by comprehensives and one of his successors, Margaret Thatcher, who did little (although not, to be scrupulously accurate, nothing) to turn back the tide.To realise quite how powerful the right’s faith in selective secondary education is, just think back to the last time it was seriously challenged from within. In May 2007, probably the high-water mark of David Cameron’s modernising phase as Tory leader, David (now Lord) Willetts, then the party’s shadow education secretary, tried telling it the truth in a speech to the CBI. “We must break free,” he said, “from the belief that academic selection is any longer the way to transform the life chances of bright poor kids … there is overwhelming evidence that such academic selection entrenches advantage it does not spread it.”The reaction? The Conservative party went nuts – especially after Cameron issued “a clear and uncompromising message to those who think they can perpetuate a pointless debate about grammar schools: we will never be taken seriously by parents and convince them we are on their side and share their aspirations if we splash around in the shallow end of the education debate”.Things became even more heated when Cameron doubled down a couple of days later, declaring it was “completely delusional” to talk about building more grammars and claiming it was “a key test for our party. Does it want to be a serious force for government and change, or does it want to be a rightwing debating society muttering about what might have been?”This proved too much for Graham Brady (now the well-respected chairman of the 1922 Committee, and one of my favourite Tories, but then an opposition frontbencher), who resigned his post in protest. At this point Cameron (characteristically, some might say) plumped for appeasement rather the proverbial “clause IV moment”. More grammar schools, it transpired, could be built in areas that still used the 11-plus exam if population increases required. Oh, and Willetts was pretty soon relieved of his responsibility for the education brief.The classic comeback, of course, to any such criticism is not to dispute the research, which demonstrates this beyond reasonable doubt. Instead it is to point out that people like me, who went to grammar schools, are pulling the ladder up with them, selfishly determined to deny others the chance to experience the supposedly glorious education were once lucky enough to receive themselves.Ad hominem bullshit, of course. But, hey, what else is there when you’re defending the indefensible?• Tim Bale is professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of The Conservative Party from Thatcher to Cameron"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8667bcdc96235f2dd8b2a19d5e7ac8dc87ff2823/0_339_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ac012bac40e3c146e965cf915916f41","title":"from babies bums to fatbergs how we fell out of love with wet wipes","story":"We now use 14,000 of the handy cloths every second - but they are increasingly clogging rivers and putting wildlife at risk. So how can we wean ourselves off them?On the eighth-floor isolation ward of London’s University College Hospital, nurses have two lines of defence against the spread of life-threatening diseases. First are the airtight double lobbies in every room. Second – and, arguably, more importantly – are the disinfectant wipes they rely on to prevent the spread of germs and viruses.For nurse consultant Annette Jeanes, the disposable flannels are a godsend that allow her and her staff, not only to protect themselves from superbugs such as C difficile and other viruses, but also to make the most of their time, a crucial factor in the National Health Service.“It’s hard to imagine a time when the NHS didn’t use wipes,” she declares as she surveys the length of T08 ward. “Our nurses are one of our greatest resources and we don’t have enough of them. Wipes have made their lives easier and freed them up to do other things.”Similar arguments could be heard the length and breadth of the UK this week after the government announced plans to address the worst effects of wet wipes following a host of revelations about the ubiquity of the throwaway towels. While the NHS – which is by far the biggest public sector user – can make a strong case for the necessity and benefits of disposable hygiene products, the picture is very different in wider society, where wipes can be more aptly described as a consumer luxury that chokes waterways and threatens wildlife.Until now, the rise of the wet wipe has been irrepressible its history a mirror of global inequality, consumerism and short-term thinking. In the 60 years since the first was deployed, usage has surged to an estimated 450bn a year - or about 14,000 every second.Market research suggests wipes and other throwaway hygiene items are near-perfect markers of haves versus have-nots. In poor nations, usage is close to zero. But once average salaries rise to $1,500 per month, women begin to buy sanitary products. From $3,500, parents are willing to spend on disposable nappies. Once incomes hit $8,000, people splash out on wipes.Age is also a factor. Younger generations whose bottoms were cleaned as babies are more inclined than their parents and grandparents to use wipes. Busy mums are the main market. In the US, 22 million Americans used pre-moist cloths 31 times or more within a week. Between 2005 and 2015, the surface area of non-woven wipes produced in Europe almost doubled.The supplanting of cloth napkins, cleaning rags and toilet paper began 60 years ago.The first pre-moistened, scented napkin was produced in a Manhattan loft in 1958 by a former cosmetics industry employee, Arthur Julius, who later convinced Colonel Harland Sanders that his finger-lickin’ chicken would sell better if messy eaters could clean up with the Wet-Nap® he had trademarked. Kentucky Fried Chicken has since given away close to a billion wipes. “Enough to reach halfway to the moon,” a spokesman claimed, omitting to mention that disposal will have to be an earthly operation and not a cosmic one.This is only a tiny fraction of the total. Tweaks to the chemical and manufacturing processes have led to alcohol swabs, baby wipes, airline refreshment towels, disinfecting tissues, antibacterials, makeup removers, insect-repellent towelettes and countertop cleaners.Julius’ company – Nice-Pak is still the market leader, churning out 150bn wipes per year – almost 5,000 a second. Rival firms spin out more than that number again, but the most modern products have little in common with the original.Fibres of the paper can now be woven, spun-laced, doused in sanitising isopropyl alcohol, scented, and preserved with anti-fungal agents such as methylisothiazolinone.But the fastest-growing market in recent years is for damp, chemically-treated alternatives to toilet paper, such as adult moist tissues, toddler care products and feminine hygiene wipes. Unlike baby wipes, they are designed to be flushable. Consumers do not appear to know the difference.As well as ugly, it is expensive. Blockages cost the UK about £100m every year, according to Water UK’s director of corporate affairs, Rae Stewart: “Water companies spend billions of pounds every year improving water and sewerage services in this country, but our sewers are just not designed to handle these new wipes which clog up the system. Sewer blockages end up costing the country about £100m every year so it’s clear that something needs to change.”This has contributed to a second wave of pollution of the Thames. Following the contamination of the industrial era, London’s river is now increasingly clogged with the detritus of the consumer age.Walk along the bank near Hammersmith or Barnes at low tide and many of the exposed rocks are flecked with wet wipes discharged through nearby sewer outlets. These are now the most common item of rubbish found on the riverside, overtaking plastic bottles and cotton buds. The citizen clean-up group Thames21 recently claimed wipes are reshaping the waterbed after finding 5,000 in an area half the size of a tennis court.Although some are supposed to be biodegradable, the risks do not go away when they break down. Kirsten Downer, campaigns officer for Thames21 fears for the herons and ducks she sees pecking on the dirty clumps in case they suffer the fate of fish. The problem has also spread along waterways towards the coast. Over the past 10 years, the Great British Beach Clean – an annual event in which volunteers collect rubbish from shorelines – has recorded a fifteenfold increase in the number of wet wipes. On average last year, they found one every five or six steps.The government’s promise of tough action on these single-use plastics has yet to be matched with deeds. The Department of Environment said it is not planning a full ban on wet wipes, but says it will work with industry to develop plastic-free alternatives and examine which products are most at fault for sewer problems. Other countries are also taking steps. The European Union is investigating wet wipes as part of a wider study of ocean microplastics. Earlier this month, Australian authorities fined Pental $700,000 for falsely claiming its White King wipes were flushable.Industry leaders in other countries prefer to stress Britain’s exceptional circumstances, saying the problem here is one of sewers rather than products. “I see issues in the UK that we don’t have in the States, notably the presence of waste on the shoreline,” said Dave Rousse, president of the the US Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry. “This suggests – with a high possibility – that sewers are opening out directly into rivers. The waste water is not being filtered.”Rather than a ban, he said the best solution was for better markings on packaging and more education of consumers so they can distinguish between more “flushable” wipes – which are made of cellulosic materials (which break up and sink) – and regular thermoplastic wipes (which bind and float). But many environmentalists and water authority officials are unimpressed by the distinction, and the higher price of the more biodegradable products puts off all but one in 10 buyers.Manufacturers are trying to develop greener products that use wood fibres and other natural materials. There are also calls for a universal ‘Bin it, don’t flush it’ logo on packaging, but the best way to ease the wipe problem is to use them less or stop completely. To help, Thames21 have issued a guide for plastic-free parenting. For the many iniduals and institutions that cannot be weaned, the best bet is to seek the most nature-friendly alternative and to discard items responsibly.At the University College Hospital, which gets through 90,000 packs of wipes each year, staff are trained to dispose carefully. Only used wipes contaminated by faeces, blood and bodily fluids and deemed to be ‘infectious waste’ are destroyed by incineration. All others are ‘macerated’ or pulped down and recycled.Specialist medical suppliers are also working on solutions without plastic. They will inevitably be more expensive, but Jeanes supports change: “I can’t see wipes disappearing from the NHS but it’s a good thing if we are questioning whether we can do things in a way that is better for the environment and reduces our own waste.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7b105294845b389aff1e4ec55d7d13c6ad7fe27/0_272_4234_2540/master/4234.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dd6805f580214615b47cf1f0ad616af","title":"local council issues tree preservation orders to stop network rail felling","story":"Bromley Council has taken steps to protect a group of mature trackside trees that are likely to be targeted in the rail operator’s plans to fell all ‘leaf-fall’ species A local authority has imposed preservation orders on trees growing on Network Rail land to stop them being felled by the operator.Bromley Council said on Friday it had issued two tree preservation orders (TPO) on a group of mature oaks, sycamores and ash trees which grow alongside the railway – many of which are likely to be targeted if the rail operator carries out its “enhanced clearance” plan to reduce delays, as revealed in the  this week.Following the  revelations, rail minister Jo Johnson called on Network Rail to suspend all current tree felling during what is the nesting season and commissioned a review into other options than felling for the rail operator.The review, which is being carried out in conjunction with the RSPB and the Tree Council, will report to Johnson in August.In order to protect its trees from action by Network Rail, Bromley council in greater London – which boasts the largest tree stock of any borough in the capital, has imposed two TPOs on a group of mature rail-side species in Ridgeway Drive. Peter Morgan, Plaistow and Sundridge ward councillor said, “Trees form part of the much-loved character of our borough, with there being reputedly more trees in our borough than other London borough and protecting the trees, for the benefit of us all is important. “I am pleased to confirm that the council has introduced a tree preservation order which protects the much-valued trees, including semi-mature oak trees, on railway land in Ridgeway Drive in Bromley.”He said the order – made in September – gave protection to all the trees which were present at the time. Morgan said: “It is important to note that this does not prevent Network Rail from carrying out necessary works in line with their statutory requirements ... it does mean that they are required to seek the council’s permission for any work.”The area where trees are now protected from felling by the rail operator covers 5,000 sq metres (5980 sq yards) worth of land alongside the railway line. The council said the species growing include a range of broad leaved trees, mainly oak, both Turkey oak and English oak, with some other trees including sycamore and ash.Network Rail has identified these species as the most problematic in terms of leaves falling on the line, and will target them for removal in its new clearance policy from next year – according to an internal document.Network Rail’s internal document identifies 13 million trees within falling distance of the track – some on third party land and some on its own land. A manual for engineers at Network Rail, seen by the , outlines the new requirements for the “enhanced clearance” of trees and vegetation from 1 April 2019.It states that “high risk leaf fall species” are sycamore, ash, sweet chestnut, poplar, lime and horse chestnut. The manual makes clear the programme for the next five years is new. It involves enhanced clearance, targeting all leaf fall trees within falling distance of the track for removal, and expands the boundary for managing and clearing vegetation from 5m to 6,5m. It states: “The ... manual provides new profiles ... designed to encourage clearance that will avoid a reactive approach.”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7069f766c026db06db7c44b9426e0feaf28adf1e/174_81_2837_1702/master/2837.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45d06db606a1c09aeab85dad9c80a777","title":"theyre out to get you study finds cyclists face paranoia about drivers","story":"As a cyclist in a busy urban environment, it can seem that some drivers are out to get you. And now a new study has concluded that for many bike riders, this is only too true: a sense of paranoia is a clinical reality.The research led by Lyn Ellet, a clinical psychology academic at Royal Holloway, University of London, studied 323 cyclists in London aged between 18-66, and used a series of questions to gauge their levels of paranoia when on a bike. In contrast, the study discovered, when measured for trait paranoia – how paranoid people are in general – the cyclists tended to show relatively low levels, and there was no apparent link between riders’ state and trait levels of paranoia.So, what is to blame for such strong feelings, summed up by one participant who is quoted in the study as saying: “I honestly view every driver as if he’s trying to kill me”?It’s seemingly down to the generally feral road conditions faced by cyclists in London (and, you could add, in most other places in the UK, not to mention other countries). The study puts it thus:The present research indicates that paranoia towards motor vehicle users may be common when cycling in London, and that far from being a pathological response, observed state paranoia is an understandable response to an urban environment containing significant and very real threat. The present findings reinforce and add a further dimension to the pressing public health need to focus on and protect urban cyclists. Highlighting this point, the study also looked into reported paranoia among travellers on London’s tube system, another transport method which has its negatives, though very rarely connected to a real personal threat to one’s safety.Here, the study said, state paranoia levels were notably lower, and there was a more general correlation between how paranoid people felt on the tube and their more general levels of paranoia.I fully understand these sentiments, though I perhaps feel a bit differently. I don’t generally think drivers are deliberately out to harm, harass or upset me – with the important caveat that this does very occasionally happen.Instead, what terrifies me is the lack of care, the casual approach to taking risks against a desperately vulnerable human on a bike by someone safely encased in a tonne of protective steel. This casual approach to others’ peril was eloquently expressed in the early 1950s by Alan Lennox-Boyd, at the time the transport minister in Winston Churchill’s government. He said: Accidents in the main arise from the taking of very small risks a very large number of times. A thousand-to-one chance against an accident may not be rated very high, but for every thousand people that take it there will be an accident.(As an aside it’s worth noting that several decades later, aged 78, Lennox-Boyd was killed by a car when trying to cross Fulham Road on foot. It’s not clear if the driver was taking one of those thousand-to-one chances, for example by speeding.)The vital point to stress is that pretty much everyone on the roads does take such risks, and often in several modes of transport. On foot you might nip across the road as a car approaches while checking your email on a bike you might slip through a narrow gap, or chance a light on amber in a car you could go too fast, or glance down when a phone message flashes.The one difference comes in terms of physics: it’s only in charge of a motor vehicle when we have a realistic chance of killing or maiming another human. It is not an equal interaction.And this is the key lesson, I’d argue, about the paranoia study: if anything is out to get you, it’s a road system still overly skewed towards the flow of motor traffic, rather than the safety of the most vulnerable road users. And that’s what needs to change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a310e813be9479ebcb7e830ee78c474f6a98d526/0_123_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b36d0d4aa74b34bacb0f4627e659755d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A nesting stork, a rescued bobcat, and flamingos at sunset are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95399cc3ba824bbe835072b92af3adbd1eb4105d/0_249_5584_3351/master/5584.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c26726fe91531cdd9d762f40f64939","title":"gael clichy pep guardiola istanbul basaksehir","story":"Gaël Clichy clearly remembers the moment Pep Guardiola changed his outlook on how he would spend the final years of his career. Guardiola arrived at Manchester City in the summer of 2016 and summoned the French defender to his office for a clinical assessment of his future.“Your career is behind you now,” Guardiola told Clichy bluntly. “But you have a duty, every day, every session, every behaviour you have young players are looking up to you and even if you don’t feel like a special player, you’ve done so many years in England, you’ve won trophies, you are somebody and those young players will look up to you and behave like you are behaving.”After one influential season under the Catalan’s guidance Clichy and City parted ways, but his former manager’s words were etched in his memory. Not wanting to slip into mediocrity for the sake of money, Clichy made the bold decision to join the little-known Turkish club Istanbul Basaksehir, who are trying to break the triumvirate of city rivals Galatasaray, Besiktas and Fenerbahce despite taking on their current incarnation only four years ago.When we meet at Basaksehir’s Fatih Terim Stadium, Clichy, now 32, says: “When I came here I thought it would be easier and maybe I could take it a bit easy. I was telling my wife it was my last few years so I want to enjoy it, but I am working even harder than I was at City. Why? Because the president gave me everything and they’re here for me. When you meet people like this you just want to give back, to work as hard as possible. The Turkish league is not as professional as the English league and I will always remember what Guardiola told me, so every day I will train as those guys are looking up to me, whether they want it or not. I have to change the club.“You have to be realistic – I am not the Gaël Clichy of 10 years ago and if I was, I wouldn’t be here, that is just a normal process but I do believe I still have something to give the club and the team. When they signed me, they told me they wanted to win the league – it could be this year, it could be next year, it could be in two years. What we do know is that we have all the weapons to do it we have great facilities, the chairman is giving everything, we have great players and we go step by step, that’s their philosophy.”Despite the club’s newness and it only attracting 5,000 fans on average to home games, they do have plenty of influence and other high-calibre players in Emmanuel Adebayor and Arda Turan. There are big plans to expand the training ground and incorporate their academy right next to the stadium. Three pitches are located next to the stadium and it will be 10 within two years in a plan not dissimilar to Manchester City’s, and it is no surprise the Turkish club are being advised by the Premier League champions. Players of Clichy’s experience have been brought in to improve professionalism.“The Turkish league is not the Premier League but I’ve found a club with similarities to Manchester City it’s a new club with good ambitions with a good setup and when I met the people from the club, the chairman and the vice-president, my mind was already made.”Playing under Arsène Wenger and Guardiola gives Clichy plenty of knowledge to proffer. His eyes were opened to a new style under the Manchester City manager and the defender is enthused by what he can still achieve.“When you’ve been used to playing for Arsenal for eight years, and for City for six, it’s always going to be a shock. When you leave those clubs you can only go down a level. I was lucky for the last 12 months to work with Guardiola and often you think of someone being a genius of football but if someone is close, he is the one. I am not saying he’s the best, as other managers have had success with different methods, but he certainly shows you a different way of feeling and seeing football. It was a major shock.”It looks as if Clichy will fall short of lifting another title this season but he is hoping to be part of a club trying to make a name for themselves. “The training ground is going to get better, we have great players and I cannot thank the chairman and vice-chairman enough for the advice they are giving every day to me and my family. It’s been very challenging and it is still an ongoing process to adapt to life here, as it’s a world apart from what I’ve been used to.”Clichy is still focused on long-term success rather than potential disappointment in this season’s title race. He thinks Arsenal need to do the same as they attempt to replace Wenger. “For 22 years, what this guy has done not just for Arsenal, but for English football, people should remember.“I think they came to a moment where people just want to see someone else. It’s not a matter of if you win the Europa League, the league or this or that, if you bring a new player in, they just want someone new. If even they had won the Europa League they would have asked for someone new because that’s football.”Clichy has played under two of the Premier League’s most influential managers since its inception but he knows in order to change the Super Lig he needs to stick to his simple philosophies. “I only have a few years left, I want to enjoy myself but for me to enjoy myself I need to work. I am a hardworking man and that’s what I’ve trained to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a7994dec31de0f41b32584b300bbdffb0119a87/0_121_4282_2569/master/4282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f119c974134d12be88aa2fbadabc6c9c","title":"jose mourinho ajax justin kluivert manchester united anthony martial","story":"José Mourinho is targeting Ajax’s Justin Kluivert this summer, with the 19-year-old favouring a move to Manchester United.Kluivert, the son of the former Barcelona and Netherlands centre-forward Patrick, has been in contract discussions with Ajax. It is understood talks have broken down because of his demand to be the highest-paid player at the club.Kluivert asked for a sizeable rise to €1.5m (£1.3m) a year and a proportion of any transfer fee to be split between him and his agent, Mino Raiola. Ajax’s policy is to pay no player more than €1m, so Kluivert demanded a significant signing-on fee.Kluivert scored 10 goals in 30 league games this season and believes he deserves fresh terms to reflect his growing status. He is on the wage of his initial professional contract, signed in 2016, which ends next summer. Kluivert made his international debut in March, as a replacement in the Netherlands’ 3-0 win over Portugal.Kluivert likes to play as a wide forward and can operate on either wing. Mourinho was a coach at Barcelona in the late 1990s when Patrick Kluivert played for the club.Mourinho’s interest in Kluivert casts further doubt over the future of Anthony Martial. The 22-year-old has been unable to hold down a starting place. The United manager criticised him after last Friday’s 1-0 defeat at Brighton and he was on the bench for Thursday’s goalless draw at West Ham.Mourinho said Romelu Lukaku may be fit enough for a place on the bench for next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Chelsea. The striker has missed United’s past two matches with an ankle injury and will be absent when they host Watford on Sunday. “We hope he can play the final,” Mourinho said. “He is in Belgium having his treatment with communication between the Belgian doctors and our medical department. We are just waiting to see if it is possible for him to be involved in the final. If not starting, at least on the bench.”Mourinho said Marcus Rashford and Martial would return against Watford. There will also be starts for Sergio Romero, Eric Bailly, Daley Blind and Juan Mata, and Michael Carrick will be captain in his final appearance before joining United’s coaching staff. “He is not going to finish the match because I want him to leave the pitch alone and I want him to feel what the Manchester United supporters feel about him,” the manager added of Carrick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2456a67925b111a0b93e8ef6f295eea49fbdc31f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a667405f0eb758586623403758f3b6a","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"A wake is in store in Swansea, Klopp faced with a juggling act and a swansong for Conte and Benítez?This feature, you will note, is called ‘10 Things to Look Out For’ rather than ‘10 Things to Look Forward To’. Thank goodness for that, because there might not be much to look forward to at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. The match between Swansea and Stoke is likely to be a wake, with both clubs wondering how the hell they got into this mess. A number of players will be making their last appearance for both sides, seeing no contradiction in the belief that they are far too good to play in the Championship. Swansea could still stay up, but they need snookers, a miracle and, most unlikely of all, at least one goal. RSSuddenly Southampton seem an attractive proposition again. Having all but avoided relegation, the club can begin looking up rather than down. There would have been an exodus of players had they dropped a ision but Saints, with Mark Hughes likely to remain, will be in a strong position again this summer. Some of the younger players, especially those such as Jack Stephens and Jan Bednarek, ought to come back hardened by the experience. There is no obvious candidate ready to jump ship, as in years gone by, with Ryan Bertrand the biggest-name exit imaginable, while it is difficult to see Sofiane Boufal or Guido Carrillo staying put in Hampshire much longer. It was always going to be a big summer either way, but with survival set to be confirmed at home against Manchester City on Sunday, the club must take stock and learn from their mistakes. BFAt 2pm on Sunday, somebody – maybe, just maybe, on Twitter – is going to be very angry at Jürgen Klopp. He can’t win with his selection for Liverpool’s last league match against Brighton. If he picks his best XI he will be jeopardising their fitness before the Champions League final against Real Madrid if he picks a weakened team he will be jeopardising Liverpool’s place in next season’s Champions League. There are so many things for Klopp to juggle: momentum, mood, match sharpness, avoiding injury to key players. Liverpool only need a point, and Klopp’s history suggests he will start a very strong side with a view to taking players off after an hour. But if one of the Fab Three twangs a hamstring, he may never hear the end of it. RSWith Champions League qualification out of Chelsea’s hands, Sunday’s trip to St James’ Park is ever likelier to be Antonio Conte’s last league game in charge. Of greater impact might be the question of whether it is also a swansong for his counterpart in the home dug-out. Although results have fallen away in recent weeks, Rafa Benítez has much to feel satisfied with a year after guiding Newcastle back up from the Championship: his side have survived comfortably after a rocky start, he has coaxed decisive performances from a number of players such as Jonjo Shelvey, Jamaal Lascelles and Mo Diamé and he remains an enormously popular figure on Tyneside. Yet as ever with Newcastle, off-field uncertainty around budgets and ownership threaten to hobble their progress, and are likely to determine whether Benítez remains at a club for whom a place in at least the top eight should be a realistic goal next season. The chance to sign off 2017-18 with a victory over historic adversaries Chelsea should be one Benítez will jump at. TDOn the face of it, the scene is set for one big royal knees-up in West Yorkshire, with Huddersfield set to toast safety and Arsène Wenger, after 22 years, bowing out of Arsenal. Wenger will be desperate to go out with a bang, particularly after a couple of raw reminders of their shortcomings under him recently, namely their Europa League exit to Atlético Madrid and defeat at Leicester on Wednesday evening. The biggest worry is that Huddersfield might wake up from their survival hangover with a bounce – after celebrating safety into the early hours of Thursday morning at a Fitzrovia nightclub. The best bit about their Premier League party was that, after opting to ditch the plane home – instead favouring the team coach so they could presumably continue festivities more easily – they were told that their coach driver was not permitted to clock up the mileage back from Stamford Bridge. David Wagner subsequently gave his players – who travelled back north on the train – two days off, but can they manage one final lasting surprise before the season’s out? BFThe biggest risk West Bromwich Albion could take this summer is to wriggle out of giving Darren Moore the full-time job. It was cruel, to say the least, that the 44-year-old picked up the manager of the month award on the same day his team were relegated from the Premier League, given he dragged the club up off the floor to the verge of whatwould have ranked one of the most extraordinary miracles of all time. He has galvanised a troubled group that had gone awry under Alan Pardew’s leadership and, if he was installed as caretaker manager sooner, it is not unfathomable to imagine a different outcome this season. The other names linked with the job – Dean Smith, Chris Wilder and even Lee Johnson – have all impressed in the Championship and, surely, Moore should at least be given a chance to do the same after bidding farewell to the Premier League at Crystal Palace. BFFor 12 years, Michael Carrick has been the best supporting actor of Old Trafford. He is the only survivor of the last great United team, which won three consecutive titles and a Champions League between 2006 and 2009. Carrick, who replaced Roy Keane by not replacing him at all, had a major impact with his defensive awareness, calmness and particularly the range and positivity of his passing. He had some lows after that - he was twice left to deal with Xavi and Andres Iniesta on his own in a Champions League final, and his mistakes against Bayern Munich in 2010 and Manchester City in 2011 were savagely punished – but recovered to become a senior player either side of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement. The coaches who appreciated Carrick, like Ferguson and Martin Jol, really appreciated him. On Sunday, United fans will get to pay tribute before he disappears modestly onto the coaching staff. RSAll right-thinking neutrals should hope this Spurs team have another crack at winning something next season, but there is a nagging sense that Sunday’s game against Leicester might be the end of an era. In a sense, that’s obvious: Spurs will play at the new White Hart Lane next season, and the whiff of a new era will extend way beyond the Michelin-starred cooking that will be a feature of Spurs’ new gastrofooty experience. But the Coquilles St. Jacques Grillées et Minestrone de Palourdes won’t taste half as good if Spurs fans are watching a different team to the one that has charmed everyone in the past three seasons. Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose look certain to leave for, erm, starters. Though they would be missed, their departure would not be heavy on symbolism. But if any of Mauricio Pochettino, Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli go, the team could break up at speed. RSA pre-match grumble-off between the respective fans here would be quite the spectacle, with Hammers bemoaning their loss of identity on and off the pitch since the London Stadium move and Everton fans simmering with discontent over their unappealing displays under Sam Allardyce. A common thread between them though might be a measure of respect for David Moyes. For all that the Scot’s reputation has tumbled in the past five years, Everton have struggled to regain the consistency and status they had under Moyes while he has at least provided West Ham with sufficient steel and organisation to survive, though fans remain ambivalent about his style and whether he’s the man for the job long-term. With Moyes confident enough to be challenging West Ham’s owners with statements about his future ambitions for the club, he can strengthen his hand with a convincing win over his former club, who also have some managerial issues to resolve, as Wayne Rooney’s wavering over his commitment to the club demonstrates. TDBurnley’s home games have been a struggle. We mean that, for the most part, in a positive sense, because they are arguably the best pound-for-pound team in the ision. Their matches have been tough and uncompromising. In 18 league games at Turf Moor, Burnley have scored 15 and conceded 15. The end-of-season atmosphere may be conducive to the players of both sides having fun of the less masochistic kind. Burnley will stay seventh whatever happens, though Bournemouth could ensure back-to-back top-ten finishes if results go their way. With both sides overachieving spectacularly, this match should also be a celebration of that pariah species: the English manager.

With the forward set to be named in Gareth Southgate’s England World Cup squad, talks may not resume before July.Sterling earns around £170,000 a week on a deal that has two years left. The forward is seeking to be one of the champions’ best-paid players and can expect a rise to his basic weekly salary of at least £50,000. City are intent on rewarding the 22-year-old for the most impressive season of his career in which Sterling has scored 22 goals and was a key factor in the title being claimed with five matches to spare.Guardiola also expects Sergio Agüero to stay, though he could no be unequivocal. Asked whether the striker may leave the manager said: “I think it’s not going to happen. My desire is it will not happen, but I don’t know … Sergio is going to stay until he decides his time is over.”Brahim Díaz and Phil Foden have each made four Premier League appearances so need to make a fifth in tomorrow’s final match at Southampton to get a winner’s medal. “I didn’t know it but, all respect, it looks ridiculous to me,” Guardiola said of the rule. “If they want my medal I will give them the medal. They are champions – they worked from day one to the last one, training with us, in the locker room.”Arsenal have suspended two coaches after allegations of bullying. They are believed to be Under-23 coach Steve Gatting and his assistant Carl Laraman. The story first  broke in the Islington Gazette this afternoon.A club spokesman told the newspaper: “We have suspended two coaches and launched an investigation following complaints from some players. These are private matters and we will not discuss any further detail.”Now here is Mark Tallentire’s look ahead to the end of season procession ... OR IS IT? ... between Southampton and Manchester City:It’s 4.07pm in London and you know what that means: that means it’s time for the Fiver!I don’t doubt that media pressure plays some part. But wasn’t he talking about the club itself not really wishing to celebrate too? I thought he was describing a prevailing climate, almost.Life as a Manchester United fan isn’t all dull – they’ve got Watford at home on Sunday! Jamie Jackson hits you with the info:Yeah, of course Pochettino is leaving Spurs. He\u0027s sick of the witch\u0027s curse and what Jonathan Wilson described as the \u0027teleological dread\u0027 that exists at the club.Or maybe he\u0027s looking forward to managing Tottenham Hotspur in next season\u0027s Champions League. Who knows? Enjoy the Europa League, Nick Ames! You tedious Woolwich shill.What I love about this job is that every day you learn things about yourself that you never knew.He has only just turned 22. It could well happen. But people start handwringing as soon as he has a quieter couple of months it’s a ridiculous environment sometimes.“I am happy about this game (Arsenal) because our last game it was not us, too poor, too boring, without intensity and quality. Without normal starting players we showed quality in desire and on the pitch. This is a good feeling for the next game and for the next season. From the kick off we put on the pitch more desire, energy, togetherness, and after we put our play in place. It is easier to play forward and give a good feeling.”They have the chance to cut loose again on Sunday when they visit the apparently joy-free zone that is Spurs.Did you see the rumours linking Sergio Aguero with a return to Atletico Madrid (who seem to like luring their old star strikers back, don’t they?) this morning? Pep Guardiola has been speaking this afternoon – and, in this take from the wires, he says it’s – probably – not gonna happen:“I think it’s not going to happen,” said Guardiola. “My desire is it will not happen, but I don’t know. “It’s happened many times in these press conferences and I said maybe a thousand times Sergio is going to stay until he decides ‘my time here is over’. I said it last season and this season many times, and I say it today. That’s why I say it isn’t going to happen, but in football you never know.” Those play-off nerves are jangling, aren’t they? It’s Derby v Fulham tonight in the Championship and both of those clubs have previous for not quite holding their nerve – albeit extremely recently in Fulham’s case.Villa and Boro face off tomorrow and this message from David Bertram captures the vibe: “As a Villa fan I’m looking forward to this weekend with trepidation and dread. Boro fans seem awfully confident.”At half time, if Swansea are 2-0 up and we\u0027re 2-0 down, there\u0027s potential for disaster for us in the second half.I\u0027m not taking anything for granted. We need to get a result against City.*This* is what it is like to be a football fan!“I don’t think it’s been a great season,” says James Brown. Not that one. “This sounds strange as we’ve witnessed probably one of the most brutally dominant and tactically fluid teams in Premier League history, led by somebody who I think will come to be regarded as the best club manager in football history. Yet somehow this has ended up being a bit dull. Maybe we’ve got too used to the absurdly consistent brilliance of Messi, Ronaldo, Kane, Barca, Real etc, or maybe it’s the sheen of those teams and iniduals that makes the stories at the other end of the table somehow more human and relatable: Moore at WBA, the story of Huddersfield, and Hodgson at Palace (who I think has done a quite incredible job).“The CL has brought the best out of our top teams rather than the league – to watch Spurs and Liverpool on occasions has been a real pleasure. As for my own team, Chelsea, it’s not been a surprise at all to see them struggle. Just frustrating they don’t seem to want to build on their success and instead seem to prefer to go through this continual updown cycle.”Interesting bits from Pochettino to digest in there, no? What’s your gut feeling? I suspect he’ll be there next season but a few games are clearly afoot.I also thought his comments, three entries down, about nothing being good enough struck something of a chord. Is that how it is to support a Big Club now? I’m curious. Have people talked and worried themselves into such a lather on social media, in particular, that they simply can’t enjoy being a football fan anymore? It kind of feels like that sometimes.Pochettino also had the following exchange with the Sky Sports reporter. It’s worth nothing that it’s always the Tottenham manager’s style to rule nothing out in the future and to say that ‘anything can happen in football.’ But it still felt that there was a degree of posturing manoeuvring to it all ….Mauricio, are we guaranteed to see you here as the manager next season?Klopp unimpressed at timing of awards eventsJürgen Klopp wrote a superb letter in praise of Mohamed Salah and Rhian Brewster to the Football Writers Association for their Player of the Year awards ceremony on Thursday, but is unimpressed with the timing of both that event and Liverpool’s own awards dinner on the same night.Salah collected the players’ player of the season and first team player of the season awards at Anfield shortly after 7pm on Thursday then flew by private jet to London to receive the FWA prize at the Landmark Hotel. He travelled straight back to Merseyside and, according to Klopp, still got an early night. But the Liverpool manager questioned the timing of the awards (usually held before the end of the season and players disappear en masse for their holidaysinternationals) when his team still need a point at home to Brighton on Sunday to secure Champions League qualification for next season.“Mo deserved all the awards he got but I am absolutely not in the mood to praise anyone for the last few months,” said Klopp. “I am really in the mood to think about Sunday. Everything he did was fantastic, otherwise he couldn’t have scored that many goals, he couldn’t have played like he played, but it is all about Sunday.“It is quite difficult for a player because there are some many challenges constantly. The next challenge was the journalists. I know it was a very important award but to bring the boy on a Thursday night before the last game to London to celebrate a party - we are not partying. The journalists should come here and give the award. You want to be really focused. The season now for most of the teams in the league is a nice time but for us it is work.“All the awards around are really deserved but hopefully the last one was yesterday and now it is about playing the game on Sunday. We need to be completely focused on the game and we will be. Yesterday we had our LFC Awards – good timing. A lot of people wished me luck for the 26th and maybe two or three people said ‘good luck on Sunday’.”Mauricio Pochettino: “It’s strange that the feeling is not great”Mauricio Pochettino has had a moan about nothing being good enough for some Tottenham supporters and pundits. The manager has secured Champions League qualification for a third successive season – on a relative shoestring and after a season away from home at Wembley – but he wondered whether the club’s glass would ever be half-full.Pochettino noted how other clubs celebrate their achievements at end-of-season awards dinners but not Tottenham. His team made sure of a top-four finish on Wednesday night with a 1-0 Wembley win over Newcastle, courtesy of Harry Kane’s 50th minute goal. Yet remarkably they were booed off by some fans after a disappointing first-half.“In the last three years, we’ve achieved massive things, to play in the Champions League, and we never celebrate,” Pochettino said. “We never celebrate! At Southampton, we avoided relegation and finished eighth in the table and we had an unbelievable party. My wife was so unhappy, I remember, because I danced. Don’t worry, there’s no video.“I remember we finished fifth in the first season and made the Europa League. It was better than in the previous season when we finished sixth, and it was: ‘Fifth is OK but it’s not enough.’ In the second season, we finished third but we lost the possibility to win the league against Chelsea with the draw at Stamford Bridge. Then we lost against Southampton and Newcastle, 5-1, and the feeling was so bad.Iceland have announced their World Cup squad!This is the final 23. If you don’t have six minutes to watch this, you can see the complete list of names (albeit first names, in the Icelandic tradition) right at the end. Gylfi Sigurdsson is passed fit enough, which is great news for them – and similarly Aron Gunnarsson. You can see people like Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Birkir Bjarnason in there too. Fascinatingly, young PSV winger Albert Gudmundsson, for whom there are high hopes, comes in. The sadness is that Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, who played up front at Euro 2016 and has been injured almost ever since, hasn’t rediscovered his fitness in time.Dominic Fifield has been busy – he’s also told you all you need to know about Palace v West Brom:Arca still had it last year – remember this?The goodbyes keep on coming!JR in Illinois is a West Brom fan, so of course he’s feeling glum at what has passed since August, but he shows us some slightly more complex working than that:“My view of the Premier League season has likely been clouded by Alan Pardew relegating my club but I’d say this season has been pretty stinky. Man City was great for a while but even they became kind of boring. Man United played atrocious football and they finished second! Liverpool and Tottenham played some great stuff but probably their best parts were in the Champions League.“Outside of City’s probable 100 point tally and Wenger leaving there’s not a whole lot to remember about this season. At least I’ll have a new competition to follow next season with the Baggies back down in the Championship.”Mark Hughes doesn’t want Southampton to hang around when deciding who their long-term (it’s all relative) boss will be. Will it be him? Or someone else? Here’s what he has said this afternoon:“So it would make sense to make a quick appointment, but I can’t shape that or dictate that, that’s a decision for the club.”Saints supporters – happy to see Hughes get a proper run at it? Or thanks for the firefighting act and farewell?I asked, a little earlier, if this had been an enjoyable Premier League season. Paul Fitzgerald has replied:“Yes but in a very prosaic way in that Man City were very nice to watch but their dominance removed any tension to proceedings. Its like when an F1 driver is laps ahead of anyone else and you have to source a duel somewhere back in the grid. You only cut back to the winner then when he crosses the chequered flag.”That’s true. My view is that it’s really not been a good season at all but that the symptoms, at least, go beyond the teams chasing City. Everything happening below, let’s say, seventh place just hasn’t been up to much at all. Throw it all up in the air next season and those spots could just as well come out in reverse – which ought to seem exciting but ... I ... don’t really know that it is.Thinking of Fortnite and therefore, as we have been encouraged to, of Jordan Hugill – I like him and he was great for a year or so in the Championship but have there been many more needless signings this season?

We’ll be seeing the old wizard cutting inside and letting fly a few more times yet!Conte: other people will judge our positionAntonio Conte believes Chelsea are stronger now than when he arrived at the club almost two years ago with the Italian insisting he has “created a base” through his stewardship.The FA Cup finalists travel to Newcastle on Sunday retaining only faint hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League, and with Conte expected to depart Stamford Bridge in the summer despite having a year left on his contract at the club. Yet, having inherited a team who had finished 10th after a turbulent season which had seen Jose Mourinho sacked and Guus Hiddink working as an interim, the head coach believes they are in a stronger position now than then.“For sure, we worked two years and worked very hard to try to build something, to create a base,” said Conte, who will confront Mourinho’s Manchester United side at Wembley in the Cup final later this month. “I think we did this. I’m the last person to judge the moment of the club. My task is to work, to do my job in the best possible way, and to work very hard with this team, with these players for the fans. Other people will judge our position.”Asked if it would be damaging for Chelsea to fail in securing a top four finish, he said: “I don’t know. I don’t know. You must know that there is this possibility, because you play in a strong league. For this reason, you have to know this and prepare in the right way. There are six top teams at the start of the season ready to fight for a place in the Champions League. It can happen.“In the past, it happened the same. Don’t forget two years ago, Chelsea ended the season 10th and not in the FA Cup final, not in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and they were eliminated in the last 16 against PSG in the Champions League. It can happen.“But last season after a 10th place we won the league. It was difficult. We worked very hard, but we won it. After a 10th place finish. Now, probably, you can finish fifth and start with a bit of an advantage compared to when you finish 10th.”Asked about the uncertainty which surrounds his own position at the club, he added: “I think I’ve been living with this speculation since the start of this season. I always said to you, my only thought is to do my job in the best possible way. To work very hard with my players. This is my only worry. Since the start of the first game, I think... I think the time I start listening to the speculation about me, this is the moment I start to be worried.”Ben Lake has sent me an exhaustive explanation of what Fortnite is and I now feel bad that he’s been pipped so succinctly by Jon Anderson’s pith. I’ve seen Battle Royale so I think I get the rough premise.“Schools have had to shut off their WiFi or had it strain to bursting by kids playing it on their phones,” Ben notes, while perhaps more pertinently noting that football clubs are trying to use it to get into esports and the streaming scene. They’ll jump aboard anything, won’t they!Wagner confirms the next stage of Wenger’s long-ish goodbye. Huddersfield is not a bad place for an Arsenal manager to bow out, in fairness: the clubs have a very nice bit of shared history, through the brilliance of Herbert Chapman, and there’s been a healthy relationship between them down the years. So there’s some degree of circularity.Rooney confirmation. Will we see him in the Premier League again?“Fortnite is a free, ‘child friendly’, Battle Royale game that includes elements of Minecraft (building) as well as shooting,” explains Jon Anderson, not before time! “Succinct enough?”I think I’ve heard enough, Jon, yes.

A Chelsea spokesperson said there was no update relating to the charge during Antonio Conte’s press conference ahead of the last Premier League game of the season against Newcastle.The spokesperson said: “We’ve got until 6pm on May 15 to respond to that charge. There’s no further update.” Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is in contention for the trip to St James’ Park following a back injury.News from Hibs, where the players haven’t seen Neil Lennon since Wednesday’s Edinburgh derby defeat to hearts. Midfielder Marvin Bartley had to handle media duties just now and was asked about Lennon’s criticism of some of his players’ “amateur” approach: “We thought we had had a very good season for our first season back in the top flight, so for the gaffer to say that. But he’s his own man and has got his own thoughts. He obviously hadn’t shared that with us so we were as shocked as everyone else.” Here’s what you may have missed:Gael Clichy has spoken exclusively to us:And you need to look out for these things at the weekend:I’m grabbing some lunch now but I’ll be back within half an hour, so don’t go too far away!Leon Britton joins the list of farewells this weekend. He’ll retire after Swansea’s relegation is – we assume – confirmed and there’s a bit of sadness to that, particularly as a side completely lacking identity could surely have used him more. You don’t need to read between the lines to see he thinks that too. It must be exhausting, after a while, when you’re a lone beacon of sanity in a morass of dross:“I have decided that this year will be my last as a Swans player,” the 35-year-old told the club website. “It’s a sad day obviously, but this season has been very difficult for me.“I have had a lot of niggling injuries and I haven’t played a lot when I have been fit. I have pushed my body through a lot, playing with injuries and injections and what have you over the years, and I think now is the right time.”We understand Wayne Rooney left Everton’s training ground because he is, in fact, injured. Stand down!Richard Dennis writes in to say he likes the cut of that Poland squad’s jib:“I know, I know, it’s a trendy pick these days, but I do like the look of Poland for the World Cup, and to threaten the later stages, semis lets say. I think there’s real high level quality sprinkled in their team now. Together with their unity, identity, ethos, an astute coach, can score goals against anyone. All that, and a fairly favourable draw. So why not?”I like the coach – Adam Nawalka – too and like a lot of the team, although I still think there’s a lot of responsibility on Lewandowski to win them games. But some of the other names, like Zielinski and Milik (if he can get back up to full steam), are pretty exciting. They should get through the group stage, for sure, and after that who knows?Darren Moore has been reflecting on a “bizarre” season at West Brom. Their match at Crystal Palace means zilch now, although another win would do Moore’s own job prospects no harm. A few quotes, taken from the wires, here:“Yes it’s been a bizarre season really, absolutely bizarre. In pre-season, nobody could have foreseen what was to come but I said from the start when I came in, you can’t cry over spilt milk.“It was about looking forward to the future, focusing on the final six weeks and to try to get continuity, togetherness, unity and team spirit - all things which go in tandem with a team moving successfully forward.“We’ve had that from everybody at the football club. We’ve come together and it’s led to positive performances and the results then followed. That was the important thing. It’s probably seen as a disastrous season but I think we all agree that we’ve finished on a real positive in the last few games.” Nobody has responded yet to my Fortnite-related plea at the top of the show, and I really don’t want to have to watch this:Good to see Jordan Hugill, mind.On that last one – Andy points out that Allardyce had said Rooney should be fit to play. The plot thickens. Anyone got the flight schedule from Liverpool to Washington?A new twist in the Wayne Rooney tale? Andy Hunter tells us that he left the Everton training ground as his team-mates went out to train – we know Rooney has had injury issues recently so that might be all there is to it, but we’ll have more as soon as we get it ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ebc00d0e84ac57bcba22e4940e6805985465f6/0_19_1450_870/master/1450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c723e4e8e7532c5bf82d4dadbca950d","title":"lack of time to do stuff oliver burkeman","story":"For most people the main problem of time management isn’t failing to prioritise what matters. It’s that there are too many things that matterIf you’re even slightly as obsessed as I am with the question of how to manage your time, you may have encountered – and been annoyed by – the Tale Of The Rocks In The Jar. As best I can tell, it originates with the self-help guru Stephen Covey, and goes (in one version) like this: a teacher presents his pupils with a jam jar, a few large rocks, several smaller pebbles, and some sand. Their challenge is to fit them all into the jar. The students, who apparently aren’t very bright, try putting the sand or pebbles in first, but then find the rocks won’t fit. Whereupon the teacher, doubtless with a condescending smile, reveals the answer: put the big rocks in first, then the pebbles and finally the sand, so the smaller items nestle between the larger. The moral: to get around to your most important tasks – your “big rocks” – you have to prioritise them. Otherwise you’ll never fit them in.But what never gets mentioned is that the teacher is being deceitful. He’s rigged his demonstration by bringing only a few rocks, which he knows in advance will fit. Yet for most people, these days, the main problem of time management isn’t failing to prioritise what matters. It’s that there are too many things that matter: too many tasks we pretty much have to accomplish in order to keep our jobs, pay the rent, be adequate parents, find a modicum of fulfilment, and so on. There are, in other words, too many rocks. And many of them are never getting near that jar.I was reminded of rocks and jars while reading The Hardest Job In The World, a brilliant recent Atlantic essay in which John Dickerson argues that the American presidency has become an impossible undertaking. Obsessed with the mendacity of the current occupant, we risk overlooking the fact that the demands of the office – managing millions of employees, making life‑or-death decisions, and defeating partisan gridlock while shuttling between ceremonies and channelling a nation’s emotions – might now be beyond the best of people. Perhaps we’ve reached the point where only someone oblivious to their limitations would seek it to begin with.You’re not the president (I mean, I’m assuming you’re not), but that doesn’t mean you might not be in a similarly impossible position. Maybe your boss’s demands can’t be met with the resources you have maybe you can’t be the spouse or parent you want to be without quitting your current job. Maybe there’s no path in life that will make you feel you’re meeting your family’s expectations while simultaneously serving your soul. There’s no principle that says you must be able to fulfil all the roles you think you ought to fulfil. And when the rules of a game make it unwinnable, the only way to win is to change the rules.For Dickerson, that means radically overhauling the presidency. For the rest of us, it means sacrifice – figuring out what you’re willing to abandon or fail at, in order to do what matters even more. Because one thing’s for certain: you’re not making that jam jar any bigger.Cal Newport’s book Deep Work offers a radical path for carving out time for the most important things – and dealing with the unavoidable truth that you can’t do it all.

We both made mistakes, but, after time apart to reflect, we started seeing each other again, six months ago.

I particularly loved this pairing of tahini with raw fish. I played with the idea at home using a dry chile de arbol – a chilli I use more than any other for its toasty, nutty flavour and adaptability. Find them online and order in bulk or use dried chilli flakes tiny peperoncino or, for a milder flavour, pul biber – Turkish chilli flakes. Then crumble into anything and everything.Fish, chilli, lime and garlic are very Mexican salad ingredients, which here are given a Middle Eastern spin with the nutty tahini: bold flavours, but an altogether fresh and light finish.1 chile de arbol, or ½ tsp chilli flakes 1 small garlic clove, unpeeledThe juice of 2 limes30g tahini2-3 tbsp toasted sesame oil, to taste1 tsp caster sugarSalt and black pepper3 fillets best quality (preferably organic) salmon, or very fresh mackerel1 small bunch chives, finely chopped2-3 tbsp stale breadcrumbs (optional)Oil, for frying (optional)For the courgetti saladA small bunch chervil, or tarragon4 courgettes4 tbsp pumpkin seed oil or extra-virgin olive oil2 tsp tamari, or light soy sauce30ml fresh lime juice 2 spring onions, peeled and finely chopped50g pumpkin seeds, toastedHeat a small, dry frying pan over a medium-high heat and toast the chilli on all sides until it smells nutty and aromatic – about 30-40 seconds. Remove the chilli and add the garlic clove – skin on – and dry-roast on all sides for about eight minutes, until blackened and soft. Peel when cooled.Meanwhile, grind the chilli to a powder in a mortar, then blitz with the peeled garlic, lime juice, tahini, sesame oil and half the caster sugar. Season to taste.Skin the salmon and cut into even 1cm dice. Add the chives and stir through the salmon, seasoning lightly with salt and pepper. You can now toss the fish with the tahini dressing if you prefer it cured – otherwise dress it at the last minute (see below). Refrigerate the fish until you are ready to eat. If you are using the breadcrumbs, fry these over a medium heat in a tablespoon of oil for five to six minutes, until golden and crisp.Wash the chervil (or, if you can’t find it, tarragon), pick the leaves and discard the stalks. Make spaghetti using all but the inner core of the courgettes with a shredder, speed peeler or spiraliser – you will know when to stop shredding when you see the seeds in the centre.When you are ready to eat, whisk the oil with the soy sauce and lime juice, and season to taste with salt, pepper and the rest of the sugar. Toss the courgetti in this dressing with the rest of the salad ingredients.Either toss the salmon with the tahini dressing and arrange in a circle or line on a large plate with the courgette salad on the side, or arrange the naked salmon on the plate and drizzle with the dressing. Scatter with the crumbs, if using, and serve at once. Alternatively you can toss the whole lot together and serve with some sticky rice on the side for a more substantial meal.I loved the tahini cream so much that I made it again with lots of extra-virgin olive oil to become a dressing for a cold udon noodle salad (great with smoked mackerel). I love courgette noodles – once the weather starts to turn properly hot, I shall be tossing them with sweet, diced tomatoes and lots of fresh summery herbs mint, basil, chervil – a lovely accompaniment to chicken schnitzel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1cf7bd2e0b43e8d618ba9d3fcab3049cc46bd6/1_0_2593_1556/master/2593.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f551202d55840d1dff70135ec444a8d3","title":"should vegan rise podcast contribute","story":"In our next We Need to Talk About podcast, we’ll consider the key questions in adopting a plant-based lifestyle. What are your views?Supporters’ voices are essential to our monthly podcast, We Need to Talk About…, whether our subject matter is Brexit, nationalism or the environment. In our next podcast, we’ll consider the rise of veganism as a lifestyle choice – why are so many are opting to go vegan, and what are the implications for society?Since  columnist Decca Aitkenhead wrote about her own vegan experiment, and we published a long read on the topic, we have had a huge number of responses – from readers, academics, experts and others. Defying naysayers’ predictions that it was yet another hipster food fad, adopting a plant-based lifestyle is becoming a popular choice for people for many different reasons. We’ve invited Decca into the studio to host our next podcast and we’d love you, the ’s supporters, to pose questions to her for the discussion. Have you or a family member recently adopted a vegan lifestyle? Have you been driven by ethical, health, environmental or financial factors? If the factors are environmental, are you concerned mostly with deforestation, bioersity loss, or something that affects you more locally? If you made the choice for health reasons, have you noticed the benefits and have you found it easy to eat a balanced diet? Is it a decision you made alone or as a family? Is it something you tried but later decided against? Perhaps you are a lifelong vegan and you are relieved to see it becoming more mainstream?Another point for discussion could focus around the role of social media in the rise of veganism. There are a number of Netflix documentaries on the subject there are Instagram influencers and prominent academics who are becoming vegan. Perhaps it works for them, but is it for everyone? There have also been concerns that veganism provides a socially acceptable cover for disordered eating. You might want to discuss the potential issues around this surge in public curiosity. Or explore how your consumption and habits have changed in recent years. Are you sceptical about the rise of veganism, or inspired by it? How can farmers and food producers adapt to better cater to the change in demand? Please do get in touch, wherever you are in the world: we would like to hear your questions, views and experiences.

Listeners to The Start have heard Ai Weiwei open up about being targeted by the Chinese authorities after his artwork commemorating the 80,000 people killed in the hushed-up Sichuan earthquake about Sofia Coppola’s nerves when her father Francis appeared on the set of her first film, The Virgin Suicides and Peaches ulge how cancer and the painful end of a relationship inspired her to make her debut album, the electronic music landmark The Teaches of Peaches.Eva Krysiak, The Start’s producer, says that artists jumped at the chance to talk about their first major creative acts. “I must have sent 400 emails asking people to take part and almost everyone we got in touch with was interested,” she says. “It’s a really warming and personal subject that is easy to talk about: there’s nothing threatening about it, there’s no prying.” Furthermore, talking about their formative work “allows people to delve into their past and remember what it was like to be an everyday Joe – a little glimpse of life before the flashbulbs were popping”.That’s not to say that there haven’t been some revelations – not least that Damien Hirst’s artistic awakening came after he broke into the house of his neighbour, a compulsive hoarder. “With a subject matter like this you can ask slightly more personal questions,” Krysiak says. “You can say ‘the time you were making this piece was the start of a relationship with somebody that you mentioned meant a lot to you – can you tell me a little bit more about that relationship?’ You hope that somebody felt comfortable enough to give you something a little bit precious or close to their heart.”The intimacy of the podcast format also encourages interviewees to open up. “There’s no camera – it feels like a safe space,” Krysiak says. “People say that being interviewed for radio feels like therapy. You are in this cosy room together, and often the sound is very soft, there’s a sense that nobody is going to interrupt you, so you have to use all of those things to your advantage.” She adds that Hirst regarded the opportunity to be interviewed about his artistic genesis as an opportunity to reveal a different side to the brash Brit-artist. “Listeners said the episode changed their perceptions of him, and that he was really likeable. They went away feeling completely different about his work. That was really nice, to realise that it takes the right kind of media and the right kind of question for that to happen, and I think that’s what podcasting is really brilliant for.” The Start was an immediate hit, with over 140,000 listeners, and people emailing in from around the world “saying that we’d made something unique and touching”. Its innovative sound design also made The Start stand out. “There’s a lot of texture,” says Krysiak. “We build up a sense of time and place using sound effects and archives, really bringing the spoken word to life. There’s a lot of layering in terms of sounds, a lot of warping and sometimes adding effects to pull people out of reality and pull them into that world of imagination and then straight back into what the speaker’s saying.” The Start was the result of a long debate at the  about what a new arts-based podcast should be. Krysiak says that she wanted it to mix household names like Hirst, Coppola and Ai with artists who are less familiar, like internet artist Ann Hirsch and drummer and composer Mark Guiliana, who played on David Bowie’s final album, Blackstar. She also ensured that there was a 5050 gender split, a multi-disciplinary approach and a distinctively international outlook, including Iranian video artist Shirin Neshat as well as Brits Abi Morgan and Lemn Sissay.A second series is being commissioned, to go live towards the end of this year, and with a new group of new names on Krysiak’s wish list. She would love to interview Marjane Satrapi, the IranianFrench author of Persepolis, “for the fact that she represented a totally different kind of ‘art’, namely the graphic novel, which also combines two different art forms, drawing and storytelling”. Toni Morrison is high on the list, to allow the author to translate her vivid storytelling abilities to the medium of audio, and to present “the firsthand realities of trying to succeed in a time and place that presented so many challenges for a black female writer.” David Lynch, the director of Twin Peaks, is another aspiration: “for managing to make it big with what must have initially been seen as a completely leftfield creative mindset and potentially impenetrable ideas”. Lynch on getting something as flat-out bizarre as Eraserhead out into the world: who wouldn’t love to listen to that?You can review and subscribe to  podcasts on , iTunes, Soundcloud, Audioboom and Mixcloud.

To watch it back now is to have every greasy pub band in Camden inside you at the same time. It is, of course, when Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner got up at the 2014 Brits and tried to make a Braveheart speech defending guitar music. “That rock’n’roll, it just won’t go away,” he cooed like he’d just been elected president of white guys. “It might hibernate from time to time, sink back into the swamp … but it’s always waiting there, just around the corner, ready to make its way back through the sludge.”Turner later tried to brush the speech aside as a joke (by that point NME had already put him on the cover mocked up as Uncle Sam with the line “rock’n’roll needs you”). Once the histrionics were over, though, it wasn’t necessarily rock’n’roll that wouldn’t go away, but the success of the Monkeys. That award was four years ago, but their last album AM has sold more than 1m copies in the UK, almost unheard-of in the streaming era, especially for an indie band. HMV says it sold more vinyl copies of AM last year than any year since its release.Perhaps this calm confidence is why Arctic Monkeys are again opting for a more old-school approach. Their new record, Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino, has been released without any lead-up singles. When it arrived, fans hearing it for the first time had to take it as a whole. There was no companion app or branded content tie-up, but those buying it in shops (including their global pop-up stores set up specifically for its release) also got a book of Turner’s lyrics, presumably so fans can rip pages out and affix them to the pinboard in their halls of residence.It is a particularly bold approach when you consider that streaming services, which prioritise inidual tracks and playlists, have grown hugely in the past couple of years. Most acts focus more on releasing all their best tracks ahead of an LP, which is often chucked out as an afterthought, if an album ever comes out at all. Even big-budget visual albums released by Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, Frank Ocean and Bon Iver were teased with single releases, giving us a sense of what was to come.The aim seems clear: not content with trying to save rock’n’roll, the Monkeys want to save the album, forcing fans to listen to their record as an entire statement rather than a collection of tracks. HMV’s music manager John Hirst has applauded their attempt to get people to “think about it as an album”, admitting to Music Week he was “delighted to finally have an album that’s likely to really shift some units”.Perhaps at the Brits 2019, Turner can make a new surly speech, to the whoops of the assembled industry dons: “It just won’t go away, that £23.99 limited-edition clear vinyl plus lyrics songbook … ”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993efc7f18e978cd9b43dee3d7ffffe84951f6b5/554_59_4224_2535/master/4224.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e0d3d41c0182a9bff1c154045048ca","title":"how metoo revealed the central rift within feminism social individualist","story":"It’s not a generational ide, but rather a split between two competing visions of feminism – social and inidualist. By  Moira DoneganWhen the #MeToo moment began in earnest last October, many women felt optimistic, galvanised others felt uncomfortable. As stories of abuse and harassment accumulated in the media, men began to experience consequences for their treatment of women. Some lost jobs, others were demoted, many faced public embarrassment. The careers of men such as Hollywood producer and alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein, masturbating comedian Louis CK, and predatory actor Kevin Spacey were declared dead. Others, like the groping chef Mario Batali, took a temporary “step back” from their public lives. A reckoning seemed to be underway, and many women felt that it was long overdue.In the media and in private life, conversations about consent, hostile environments and power began, and there was a growing acknowledgment that a man’s unwanted sexual overtures were a symptom of broader social and political forces. Soon, these discussions were interrupted by hand-wringing and anger from male commentators – everyone from conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan to Donald Trump – who claimed the movement had gone too far before it really began. But unexpected ides emerged between feminists as well.Some feminists urged caution others wanted the reckoning to go further. But the most common complaint about #MeToo came from those who felt that the whole movement had very quickly become silly. Self-described feminists such as Daphne Merkin and Bari Weiss in the New York Times, Katie Roiphe in Harper’s, Germaine Greer in the Sydney Morning Herald and 100 French women in Le Monde complained that many of the incidents of harassment were too minor to warrant opprobrium. They argued that by grouping together such a wide spectrum of sexual misbehaviour, #MeToo had lost a sense of nuance. They called on women to toughen up. Whatever happened to no-nonsense rejections, they asked. Those who complained about harassment and assault, Merkin wrote, “perceive themselves to be as frail as Victorian housewives”. By this logic, women could solve the problem of sexual harassment and assault with good humour, patience and a high tolerance for pain.This disagreement was quickly characterised in the media as generational. Older feminists, we were told – say, anyone over 40 – were sinisterly complicit, laughably outdated, or just too scared of overstepping. Younger women, depending on who you asked, were either righteously passionate, naively idealistic, or out for blood.In part, this notion of a generational ide came from the feminist opponents and supporters of #MeToo themselves. In Harper’s, Roiphe derided the #MeToo movement as “Twitter feminism”, giving the impression that only narcissistic, social media-obsessed millennials want a reckoning over sexual assault. In her article criticising the direction #MeToo was taking, Bari Weiss emphasised the youth and naivety of an anonymous woman who made allegations against the comedian Aziz Ansari. Meanwhile, the feminist website Jezebel, whose readers and writers skew young, ran an article headlined “The Backlash to #MeToo is Second-Wave Feminism”, gesturing vaguely at a misguided crop of older feminist thinkers but not engaging much with those thinkers’ actual achievements and failures. Each side used age stereotypes, with varying degrees of cynicism – older women were crotchety or out of touch, younger women were egoists or spoiled children. None of this commentary seemed interested in the fact that the women coming forward with stories of sexual abuse were both young and old. #MeToo’s feminist detractors also come from different generations. At only 32, Weiss is young enough to be Merkin’s daughter, or Greer’s granddaughter.The #MeToo moment and its backlash made it clear that there really was a ide among feminists, but analysis of that ide cast it as a mere catfight, or a screaming match between weary mothers and teenage daughters. The implication was that the feminist debate unfolding around #MeToo is a kind of routine domestic drama, something we’ve seen before.This is a mistake. A closer look at the arguments being made by these two camps reveals a deeper, more serious intellectual rift. What’s really at play is that feminism has come to contain two distinct understandings of sexism, and two wildly different, often incompatible ideas of how that problem should be solved. One approach is inidualist, hard-headed, grounded in ideals of pragmatism, realism and self-sufficiency. The other is expansive, communal, idealistic and premised on the ideals of mutual interest and solidarity. The clash between these two kinds of feminism has been starkly exposed by #MeToo, but the crisis is the result of shifts in feminist thought that have been decades in the making.The central claim of the anti-#MeToo feminists is that the movement does not treat inidual women as moral agents with the capacity to say no, to enjoy and pursue sex, and to do wrong. From this perspective, women who come forward about their experiences of harassment or assault should often be given more responsibility for those experiences than the rhetoric of #MeToo assigns them. This thinking partakes in a long moral tradition – one that’s highly compatible with capitalism – in which personal responsibility, independence, and willingness to withstand hardship are revered as particularly valuable virtues. It’s an ethos of pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps – from poverty into prosperity, or, in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ logic, from “feminine” victimhood into “masculine” strength. They believe that the pervasiveness of sexual harassment suggests that it is inevitable, and that the best response is not anger, but resolve. Theirs is a feminism that posits that inidual women have the power to make choices to diminish the negative impact of sexism, and to endure any sexist unpleasantness that can’t be avoided – if only they have the grit to handle it.On the other hand, there is the #MeToo movement. It might seem strange to assert that #MeToo can be spoken of as a single ideology at all – that this cultural moment, which has exposed such a broad array of bad behaviour across so many industries and disciplines, could ever be coherent enough to have an agenda. But #MeToo, as a social movement and as a personal gesture, makes certain assumptions that aren’t compatible with the intellectual habits of most mainstream feminisms that have preceded it. By saying “me too”, an inidual woman makes herself a part of a broader group, and chooses to stand with others who have been harassed, assaulted or raped. This solidarity is powerful. It is still rare to see such a large group of women identifying their suffering as women’s suffering, claiming that they have all been harmed by the same forces of sexism, and together demanding that those forces be defeated.In this light, the ersity and breadth of the #MeToo movement is not a weakness, but a strength. After all, if so many women, with so many different kinds of lives, have experienced the same sexist behaviour from men, then it becomes easier to believe that the problem goes beyond iniduals and instead relates to wider cultural forces. The ubiquity of sexual harassment means that an inidual can’t simply avoid it by making the right choices, or by steeling herself with forceful determination the demand that she do so begins to look absurd.Call it, then, a conflict between “inidualist” and “social” feminisms. In part, the rift is between visions of how to undertake the feminist project, of which tactics are best: whether through inidual empowerment, or through collective liberation. But there is a greater moral ide between these two strands of thought, because #MeToo and its critics also disagree over where to locate responsibility for sexual abuse: whether it is a woman’s responsibility to navigate, withstand and overcome the misogyny that she encounters, or whether it is the shared responsibility of all of us to eliminate sexism, so that she never encounters it in the first place.This tension, between inidualist and social feminisms, has dogged the women’s movement since its revival in the mid-20th century. According to the inidualist model of feminism, personal responsibility, inidual freedoms and psychological adjustments offer a woman meaningful routes out of the suffering imposed by patriarchy, and into equality with men. Many of the most famous western feminists have been working in this tradition. For instance, Betty Friedan, author of the hugely influential 1960s feminist text The Feminine Mystique, argued that sexist cultural codes prevent women from achieving personal happiness. Friedan, a psychologist by training, focused on the inner lives of white, American, middle-class women at midcentury. More recently, inidualist feminism found a high-profile advocate when Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published her memoir-cum-manifesto Lean In in 2013. Sandberg laments the lack of women in leadership positions, and her book is a how-to manual for women with lofty corporate ambitions.Social feminism has a similarly long, if less well-known, history. Soon after Friedan’s book became a bestseller, Italian feminists such as Leopoldina Fortunati and Silvia Federici began to formulate a different way of looking at the problems that women faced. As Marxists, they sought to analyse how men as a class related to women as a class. They were less interested in ideas of empowerment and self-actualisation than they were in isions of labour, living conditions and cold, hard cash. They argued that so-called “women’s work” – everything from mopping floors to dressing wounds to breastfeeding, cooking, prostitution, laundry and tending to the elderly – should not only be seen as work, but as essential to the capitalist wage-labour system. If men did not have these functions performed for them at home, these women argued, they would not be able to return to work and produce effectively. Male work in the factory relied upon female work in the home.When Federici’s Wages for Housework campaign launched in 1972, it attracted fierce public debate – first in Italy, and then in the US after Federici moved to New York and opened a Wages for Housework office in Brooklyn. The political mainstream found Federici’s idea ridiculous. Could she really mean that a woman should be paid for scrubbing the floors in her husband’s house? But the movement relied on the understanding that a wage was necessary for work to be seen as work, and for the people who did it to be seen as worthy of dignity and protection. More a rhetorical device than an immediate policy prescription, the demand “wages for housework” relied on a conception of women as a “class” in the same sense as a class of workers – a group of people with something in common who could organise on behalf of their shared interests.The Wages for Housework movement fizzled out, but its influence has lived on in campaigns for racial justice, gay rights, housing rights and sex workers’ rights. Behind Wages for Housework lay the idea that women’s oppression was widespread, that it had common features even for women who lived very different lives, and that it was more than just a personal experience – it was a political phenomenon. But because sexism beats so many people down, that also meant that there was a community of women who could pull each other up. Those who experience gendered oppression can band together to end it.Something similar is at stake in #MeToo’s assertions that sexual harassment and assault are systemic, and that women can unite to demand an end to them. While inidualist feminists such as Friedan and Sandberg have examined the problem of sexism by zooming in, to consider women’s psyches and attitudes, Wages for Housework zoomed out, to examine how women were oppressed by the economic forces of capitalism. #MeToo has a less ideological, more ad hoc approach to its analysis of patriarchy. But its gesture proceeds from the assumption that misogyny is structural, and that women have a shared interest in fighting it.This does not mean that #MeToo treats all women’s experiences as the same. The movement has included stories from women of different races, orientations and religions. It has brought testimony from women who are rich and poor, healthy and chronically ill, cis and trans, famous and anonymous. This variety has led to an increasing acknowledgment that misogyny takes different forms, and that not all women have access to the same tools used to mitigate it.At its best, #MeToo’s social feminism has been heavily influenced by black American feminist scholars such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, whose work aims to confront the combined nature of racism and sexism in the lives of black women, and to analyse how, for the people who experience both racism and sexism, the phenomena don’t feel distinct at all. In her 1989 legal article Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex, Crenshaw called for a new way of understanding oppression that she referred to as “intersectionality”. Put very simply, this meant taking into account the ways that oppression looks different for different people, and how iniduals experience oppression along more than one axis at once. In practice, Crenshaw’s approach suggests that an effective movement against patriarchal oppression must also confront other systemic inequalities – ones that lend power and viciousness to many women’s experiences of sexism.Intersectionality has given #MeToo a more expansive understanding of sexual harassment and assault. The gesture of saying “me too” implies solidarity with all women who have had these experiences, but the form the movement has taken has also allowed for it to be a specific, personal declaration, and for those testimonies to come from women with different stories and in different circumstances. For every anti-#MeToo feminist who scornfully asks, “Why didn’t you just leave?”, there have been dozens of women explaining the circumstances of their lives that effectively barred the door. Often, these stories have made it heartbreakingly clear that not everyone can risk their job by giving a firm, uncompromising “no” to a handsy boss or coworker that not everyone can afford to call an emergency cab that not everyone has the privileges that make it easy to act in the ways that the inidualist feminists so often prescribe.#MeToo’s sheer number of testimonies has vindicated theories of sexism as a universal, but not uniform, force –that is, as something that every woman will experience, but that every woman will experience in different ways. But in its solidarity, its public gesture of women coming together to demand an end to harassment and assault, the movement also continues the tradition of women’s class consciousness, unity and need for confrontation with systemic injustice. Call it the “too” of #MeToo: the understanding that meaningful liberation from misogyny will only be achieved collectively, with changes at the structural, cultural and institutional levels. Social feminism does not aspire to enable a few women to gain positions of power in patriarchal systems. It’s not about giving women “a seat at the table”. It’s about taking the table apart, so that we can build a new one together.This is not a simple proposition. As an approach, social feminism has real flaws, though its most significant weaknesses are not the ones that #MeToo’s prominent critics choose to address. The real weakness of social feminism is not that it encourages women to be oversensitive about discomforts, but that it is so broad. The call for women to unite can overlook the kinds of pain and conflict that can exist between them.After all, who do we mean when we talk about “women”? What experiences or conditions, exactly, do we identify as common to all women? It is difficult to generalise about so many people at once, and questions of injustice, inequality and privilege mean that doing so puts us at the risk of ignoring vital differences. Women are a varied bunch, and they encounter intersecting oppressions that are not of patriarchy’s exclusive making: racism, classism, ability and sexuality. Often, these oppressions are enforced by other women. There are vast gulfs that separate women from one another: gulfs of racism and money, of colonialism, bigotry, history, resentment, defensiveness, ignorance and hurt. It can be very hard to see each other across them.#MeToo, however, has made it clear that solidarity among women is possible. The working definition of “women”, as #MeToo has constructed it, can be understood simply: as everyone who has experienced misogyny. It’s a bleak kind of solidarity, this acknowledgment of shared suffering. But #MeToo has transformed that mournful acknowledgment into something much more hopeful. If the #MeToo movement has prompted many women to focus on misogynist behaviour with a unifying grief and anger, it has also led many of them to contemplate our shared power and common vision for a different world. When the social feminists of #MeToo call for changes that would make harassment, assault and other forms of misogyny rare, their very act of collective imagining makes such a world more possible: the more we stand together in this demand, the easier it becomes to imagine a world where respect is common, where cruelty is rare, where all of us think with more empathy and intelligence about the lives of others, and where being women will not doom us to suffering or limitation.Again, this is an old debate: whether feminism’s aim should be to transform society, or to better equip inidual women to navigate within it. But why, then, has this clash been framed as generational, when it is clear that the two visions of feminism have been doing battle for decades? Part of it, of course, is ageism and incuriosity – the reflexive tendency to presume that the old are too timid and the young are too reckless. And there is the idea, unique to feminism among all other strands of political thought, that feminism is a social movement that must occur in discrete, coherent and temporal “waves”.But another reason why #MeToo has been framed as a generational conflict is because the inidualist feminists of the anti-#MeToo backlash have framed their own resistance to the movement as grounded in wisdom, realism and, above all, maturity. To them, all this talk of a reimagined, recreated new world sounds hopelessly naive. Daphne Merkin summed up the tenor of the anti-#MeToo assessment in her article in the New York Times, when she wrote to the women coming forward: “Grow up, this is real life”.This is a common, but still very strange belief: that the epitome of maturity and personal strength is the resigned acceptance that the world cannot be better than it is, that we cannot be kinder to one another, that male entitlement, crassness and predation are permanent and unchangeable and must be endured. It is a bizarre conception of strength, one that dismisses as childish weakness any demand for a better world, any hope that things might one day be different. There is a way of thinking that makes this approach by the anti-#MeToo feminists seem strong and pragmatic. But there is another way of thinking that makes it seem very sad.In her book Trauma and Recovery, about the treatment of rape victims and other psychiatric patients who have undergone horrible abuse, the Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman writes of the temptation to sympathise with a patient’s abuser. “It is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator,” she writes. “All the perpetrator asks is that the bystander do nothing. He appeals to the universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil. The victim, on the contrary, asks the bystander to share the burden of pain.” Something similar may be at work in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ desire to advocate for an inidualist feminism. Their call to sympathise more with the perpetrators of sexual assault, and to place greater responsibility for those assaults on the choices of women who experience them, is part of an effort not to feel implicated in the suffering of others, not to share that burden of pain. #MeToo and the reckoning that it has provoked has given us all knowledge we would rather not have – knowledge of just how normal some terrible things are, of just how much some of us have suffered. The anti-#MeToo feminists of the world are not the only ones who feel tempted to look away.

Carruthers said that as the 10 DUP MPs supported Brexit, “they are not going to tell you anything you haven’t been told before”.Critics said Rees-Mogg’s comments showed he was out of touch and closed-minded. David Parkes, a 25-year-old jockey in Middletown, said he would be happy to speak to Rees-Mogg and explain the impact Brexit was having on border communities. “If you speak to the DUP or Sinn Féin you’re always going to get the same view. If you speak to people who are not political but who live on the border you’ll find out how this area is booming because of the open border and we don’t want that to change. His comments are very arrogant and judgmental,” he said.Martin Eves, who runs Envirogrind, a business operating in the border areas in counties Donegal and Fermanagh, said: “It is typical of the attitude that exist with these people who can get up in the morning and know there is a crisis but fully accept that they will learn nothing from the people on the border. It is a closed mind and you don’t get very far in negotiations with a closed mind.”Paul Butters, spokesman for Best for Britain, a remain campaign group, said: “Rees-Mogg is out of touch and this shows it. He looks foolish. He should visit the border and see the impact of his ideological dogma on the people who live there.”Rees-Mogg’s interview comes amid a flurry of interventions on the Irish issue in the past 48 hours. The former Ulster Unionist party leader David Trimble said on Wednesday that “true friends of Ireland” should “cease the scaremongering”. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, was reported in a Daily  article on Friday to have said he feared Brussels would use the border issue to hold Britain hostage in negotiations.Rees-Mogg believes that the border issue can be solved by technology. However, the former prime minister Sir John Major said in a speech at the Irish embassy in London on Thursday night that food checks could not be done by cameras or online, and unless there was regulatory alignment on both sides of the border then inspections posts would be unavoidable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50268d5738df5f896c352d603db76ea756af1291/0_218_4898_2938/master/4898.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b400c17f043993d8fd77c81681e146f4","title":"what did leaveeu do wrong and could its breaches stop brexit","story":"The Electoral Commission’s findings may carry heavier implications than a £70,000 fineLeave.EU, backed by the outspoken Ukip donor Arron Banks, was one of several pro-Brexit campaign groups founded to fight the 2016 referendum on EU membership. However, it failed in its attempt to be named the official campaign for Brexit by the Electoral Commission.This designation instead went to the rival Vote Leave group, which was allowed to spend up to £7m during the final weeks of the referendum campaign. This meant Leave.EU was reduced to being a second-tier campaign group, legally allowed to spend just £700,000 during the referendum campaign.Following a lengthy investigation the Electoral Commission has concluded Leave.EU broke this reduced spending limit by at least £70,000 and possibly substantially more. This was largely as a result of paying substantial sums to a US political consultant, Gerry Gunster, who later introduced Banks to Donald Trump at an impromptu meeting at Trump Tower in late 2016.The Electoral Commission also concluded that Banks incorrectly declared £6m worth of loans he made to the campaign group, that appropriate receipts had not been kept, and that the campaign’s chief executive, Liz Bilney, may have “knowingly or recklessly” signed an inaccurate spending return.Leave.EU’s punishment for spending too much money in the EU referendum is to have to spend a bit more now. The Electoral Commission has fined the campaign organisation a total of £70,000 for failures in its declaration, with the regulator noting the level of penalties “has been constrained by the cap on the commission’s fines”. The punishment could prompt calls for a review of election funding law, given it is relatively small for a campaign that also spent millions of pounds in the unregulated pre-referendum period. There may be a worse outcome for Bilney, a business associate of Banks who served as Leave.EU’s official campaign chief. She has been reported to the politan police for a potential criminal investigation into whether she made a false declaration on the spending return.Banks has always maintained that, while they initially attempted to hire Cambridge Analytica, this plan was dropped when Leave.EU failed to be designated as the lead Brexit group, meaning the data targeting business never actually worked on the referendum campaign.The Electoral Commission’s report largely bears this out, concluding that Leave.EU was largely bluffing about its use of Cambridge Analytica, in an attempt to make its campaign look more sophisticated. The report also suggests that the Cambridge Analytica boss, Alexander Nix, overstated his company’s association with Leave.EU in public, in the hope of winning business from the campaign group.The investigation states that despite public statements by the organisations involved there is no evidence that Cambridge Analytica had input into the Leave.EU campaign during the regulated period and “the relationship did not develop beyond initial scoping work”. Instead, the data targeting company privately asked Leave.EU to stop using its name in public, fearing the association could cause it reputational damage.However, the commission pledged to keep this aspect of the investigation under review in case further evidence about Cambridge Analytica comes to light.Almost certainly not, given it is the key policy of Theresa May’s government, although it could prompt a reform of campaign finance laws. MPs are increasingly aware that is is difficult to find appropriate punishment for breaking electoral spending laws once an election result has been declared and accepted by the public. Pro-Brexit MPs have also accused remain campaign groups of colluding to evade spending limits, although the Electoral Commission declined to investigate.Meanwhile, the official Vote Leave campaign group is facing a separate ongoing investigation into whether it broke its own £7m spending limit by channelling substantial sums of money to a fashion student during the final days of the campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8613467c1ae40e103829ae45e883d087bf6a4d/0_25_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6bab78119697774206ace7d39f6d59e","title":"dinosaur skeleton therapod auction paris","story":"Anyone with a spare million euros or two will have the opportunity to not only own a unique species of dinosaur skeleton next month, but to name it.Scientists say the skeleton of the species of therapod – or three-toed dinosaur – dates from the late Jurassic period about 155m years ago, give or take a million or so years. It will go on sale at an auction to be held inside the Eiffel Tower in Paris and is expected to fetch more than €1.2m (£1.1m). Some proceeds from the sale will go to charities for endangered animals, including Sea Shepherd and Ann Van Dyk Cheetah Centre in South Africa.Scientists at first thought it was an allosaurus, but when the carnivore’s remains were more closely examined in 2016, specialists noticed it had major anatomic differences, including more teeth and different bones.Dinosaur expert Prof Eric Mickeler, who is overseeing the sale for auctioneers Aguttes, said the skeleton was the highlight of his 20-year career.“It’s not every day you come across a new species of carnivore and a skeleton that is so complete – in fact it’s very rare,” Mickeler told the . “This is the first time in almost 20 years I’ve seen anything like this. It’s fantastic, with an extraordinary skull, lots of teeth and the claws.”He added: “The rule for all scientific discoveries that are confirmed to be new, the person who owns it can give it its scientific name. It can be the name of a company or a person. Then they just add an ‘-us’ on the end.”Allosaurus derives from the Greek words allos meaning strange or other, and sauros meaning lizard. The dinosaur was similar to the tyrannosaurus rex.Mickeler said such discoveries were extremely rare. “This isn’t something you just stumble across: you have to go looking and digging for it.”The dinosaur skeleton is mounted on a stainless steel structure allowing for the skull to remain, rather than be replaced with a lighter resin replica as most museum displays. This structure also allows inidual bones to be removed for scientific study.Mickeler said he hoped the skeleton’s new owner would put it on public display. “Dinosaur skeletons used to be bought by museums or collectors but recently there’s interest from a whole range of people. Thankfully in all the sales I have handled there’s never been one where the skeleton has ended up in a private place. Buyers like to share their pleasure, and there’s the size to consider,” he said.In recent sales, dinosaur bones have gone for more than £1m. The skeleton, which is on display in the southern French city of Lyon, will be transported and reassembled in the Gustave Eiffel salon on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower next month and be sold in a single-lot auction on 4 June after a two-day exhibition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fda58f19564d3b0c82d889f657448d36f188eef/0_44_3053_1833/master/3053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f207469f48e7e6c13e11e2bdd11a4888","title":"chinese nicknames nba players playoffs","story":"The richly layered and occasionally mean fan-sourced monikers for NBA players in basketball-mad China are a refreshing departure in an era when star athletes brand themselves within an inch of their livesEarlier this week I started a Twitter thread of Chinese nicknames for NBA players that went massively viral. Although I personally found these nicknames hilarious and thought a few other people might too, I never expected the response to be so large, which got me wondering what it is about these Chinese monikers that people find so entertaining.Part of the answer is undoubtedly that American sports nicknames have become incredibly dull in recent years. Compared to earlier eras in which sportswriters and fans drove the creation of colorful and sometimes insulting nicknames, the modern athlete is often a wealthy player-entrepreneur who seeks to build a global “brand” and therefore is more likely to foist their own “nickname” onto the media and the fan base, most likely one that is anodyne, short and thus social media ready, and easily understood across language and cultural boundaries. In many cases, the player’s chosen “nickname” is little more than their initials, or their initials and their uniform number.On the Chinese side, there is a strong incentive to come up with short, pithy nicknames for foreign athletes and celebrities, because the phonetic transcriptions of western names used in official sources are incredibly long, dull, and hard to remember.Just take Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook, for example. Although his name is only two words in English, in phonetic Chinese, it becomes the eight character monster 拉塞尔·衛斯布鲁克 (which in pinyin is luó sù · wèi sī tè bù lǔ kè, pronounced Loh-Soo Way-Suh-Tuh-Boo-Loo-Kuh), for a staggering total of 77 inidual strokes, even using the much simplified Chinese characters favored in mainland China.No wonder Chinese fans prefer to call him something much shorter, like 威少 (“Lord Wei,” from the first syllable of “Westbrook”), 忍者龟 (“The Ninja Turtle,” because people think he looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle), or simply 西河 (“The Western River,” a direct translation of “Westbrook”).The standardized phonetic versions of foreign names are also hard to remember because characters are deployed in random arrangements, chosen solely for their sounds and without any regard for their meanings, resulting in bizarre and nonsensical phrases. This practice deprives Chinese of one of its greatest advantages over western languages – namely that Chinese characters convey both sound and meaning at the same time, not to mention rich historical and literary connotations from China’s 3,500 years of history.In crafting new nicknames for NBA players, Chinese netizens take full advantage of the the richness and history of Chinese characters and language, and the results are often a series of astonishingly complex and overlapping visual and verbal puns.Take the case of San Antonio Spurs shooting guard Danny Green. When Green’s shooting percentage dropped off precipitously during the 2015-16 season, Chinese Spurs fans started calling him “Shoots Bricks Green” (张铁林). The first character 张 (zhāng) is short for 张手 (zhāng shǒu), which means to shoot a basketball, the second character 铁 (tiě) is short for 打铁 (dǎ tiě), which literally means “striking iron” but is the Chinese slang term for an ugly missed shot (a “brick”), and 林 (lín) is short for 格林 (gé lín),which is Chinese phonetic transcription of “Green.”However, when you put these characters all together, “Zhāng Tiělín” is also the name of a famous Chinese-born British actor best known for playing the Qianlong Emperor on the Chinese television series My Fair Princess. Accordingly, people started calling Green “My Royal Father” (皇阿玛, huáng ā mǎ), which is what the prince on the show always called the Emperor.Another example is Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball, whose just concluded rookie season was promising but whose shooting was generally worse than advertised. Chinese netizens took to calling Ball “Pavel Korchagin” (保尔柯察金), a pun that is several layers deep.First, the Chinese characters for “Pavel” (保尔, bǎo ěr) sound very similar to the characters for “Ball” (鮑爾, bào ěr). But more importantly, Pavel Korchagin is the protagonist of a 1930s Soviet socialist realist novel, extremely well-known in China, called How the Steel Is Tempered. The image of “tempering steel” reminds people of how “striking iron” means bad shooting.Kobe Bryant himself has several amusing nicknames alluding to his low shooting percentage, including “The King of Striking Iron” (打铁王) and “The Los Angeles Blacksmith” (洛杉矶铁匠). Perhaps the most amusing, however, is people calling Kobe “Carbon Monoxide, Ferric Oxide” or “CO, Fe2O3” (一氧化碳, 三氧化二铁), which sounds exactly the same as “He shoots one fadeaway and misses, he shoots three fadeaways and bricks two of them” (一仰化叹, 三仰化二铁).It is this combination of cleverness, levity, and meanness, as well as the layers of puns and allusions, which make Chinese nicknames so fun to try to understand. Unlike many American sports nicknames, which tend to be rather straightforwardly hyperbolic and unironically positive (not least because many are chosen by the athletes themselves), even the more positive Chinese nicknames tend to be a mixture of both praise and sarcasm that both fans and haters can get behind.Thus, although Hall of Fame rebounding legend Charles Barkley was called a “fat pig,” he was a flying fat pig (飞猪), alluding to his preternatural ability to rise above taller, slimmer players to grab copious numbers of rebounds (the Chinese words for “fat” and “flying” sound the same). Similarly Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid is called “the Great” (大帝), but with the sarcastic implication that this is a self-anointed epithet that Embiid has not yet earned. Likewise while Spurs star Manu Ginobili’s nickname “The Demon Blade” (妖刀) sounds awesome, and does indeed allude to his incredible ability to slash through defenders and get to the basket, in Chinese martial arts fiction a sword possessed by a demon is quite powerful and devastating to enemies, but often turns against its owner at crucial times, which recalls Ginobili’s track record of occasionally making mistakes or letting down his team in big moments.The one of the few NBA player with entirely positive nickname is Michael Jordan. Jordan is called 帮主 (“gang boss” or “sect leader”) because one of the Chinese characters for his last name 乔丹 (qiáo dān) is the same as the surname of Qiao Feng, the legendary leader of the “Beggars’ Sect” in popular wuxia martial arts novels, often known simply as “Sect Leader Qiao” (乔帮主).It is difficult to overstate how beloved and respected Qiao Feng is in Chinese-speaking communities worldwide. An unparalleled martial artist and brilliant leader, Qiao fights for justice and sacrifices for the greater good. This is truly high praise and is a sign of the respect and esteem Chinese people still have for Jordan (as well as Steve Jobs, the other foreign person they nicknamed after Qiao Feng).Given the large and growing importance of the Chinese market to the NBA’s present and its future, players and teams may want to learn more about the various nicknames that Chinese fans have given them, and may want to play a more proactive role in helping shape how they are called by Chinese fans. Simply pushing existing English nicknames onto Chinese fans is unlikely to succeed, even and perhaps especially if those nicknames are just letters and numbers. As one Chinese netizen puts it, “The English nicknames are mostly boring to us. We only use them for players who are not popular or don’t have too many fans. When a player gets popular in China, they start to get a bunch of new nicknames.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3111dab416d02bcadd915df8f631ebf429d7ea91/154_147_4544_2728/master/4544.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2936764f194e714d260df2e8bfa072e9","title":"racing 92 champions cup rugby union","story":"France’s commitment to slow influx of overseas players paying off with 12 Frenchmen to start final against LeinsterIf England’s selection of Brad Shields and the accompanying controversy is a case study into the strained relationship between availability, eligibility and nationality in the modern game, spare a thought for the France full-back Scott Spedding.The South Africa-born Spedding has 23 caps for Les Bleus, he holds a French passport, has played in the country for a decade and was moved to tears live on camera when learning of his first call-up four years ago. He was not registered with the French federation for five years before the age of 23 however, nor did he spend three years in an academy, and is therefore not considered a JIFF (joueurs issus des filières de formation) – effectively a French-reared player.All of which brings us, in a roundabout way, to Racing 92, who contest a second Champions Cup final in three seasons on Saturday, against Leinster. They do so with Dan Carter in their squad – and it would be naive to dismiss the possibility that he will seal the winning points before heading off to Japan – but Racing is no longer a destination for southern hemisphere players to arrive en masse and line their pockets.They find themselves one win away from Europe’s top prize, having averaged the most JIFFs per match in the Top 14 this season. There is obvious sympathy for Spedding’s plight but Racing’s success can be considered evidence that the LNR’s commitment to slow the influx of overseas imports is paying off.Of course, Racing still have overseas players – Pat Lambie starts at fly-half, Leone Nakarawa and Donnacha Ryan make up an Irish-Fijian second row, while Finn Russell and Simon Zebo arrive next season – and it certainly helps to be bankrolled by someone as wealthy as Jacky Lorenzetti, but there has been a clear shift in attitude by their billionaire owner and les deux Laurents – Labit and Travers – their two coaches.To demonstrate, there were only six Frenchmen in the starting XV in the 2016 final against Saracens and that soon became five when Mike Phillips replaced Maxime Machenaud midway through the first half. Machenaud is again struck by misfortune – a knee injury rules him out – but Racing will attempt to claim the trophy Lorenzetti has coveted since he bought a majority stake in the club in 2006 with 12 French players in their side.Machenaud’s absence will be keenly felt but in Teddy Thomas, Camille Chat, Wenceslas Lauret and Yannick Nyanga there is a core of French players who will put to the test the theory that Ireland, both domestically and internationally, are Europe’s dominant force this season. And the benefits for the French national team are obvious.Whisper it quietly but at a time when their World Cup pool rivals are facing accusations of poaching All Black cast-offs, there is a creeping sense that France are belatedly getting their house in order. Victory for Racing on Saturday would only add to it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8109f4cc7f057de468ee7e753cc3efa042dec115/212_171_3388_2032/master/3388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f1e7ebcb0611a33f853b4c698fbbcde","title":"county cricket surrey v yorkshire somerset v hampshire and more live","story":"Join our team of writers for updates from around the grounds on day one of the fifth round of Championship matchesWe are up and running after tea at the Oval, where Ollie Pope reached an important half-century before the break and, in his unbeaten 28, Rikki Clarke topped 10,000 first-class runs. Surrey are 214-6 as I type. Wickets have certainly tumbled at Trent Bridge and New Road. Notts all out for 133, although Lancashire are 73-0 in reply. Alex Davies is unbeaten on 46 with Haseeb Hameed to bat at three. Essex have been bowled out for 177, although Worcestershire have yet to start their reply. Early breakthrough for Northamptonshire as Doug Bracewell follows up his earlier feats with the bat to get Dom Sibley caught at third slip. Slight juggle from Brett Hutton but he held on falling to his right. The Bears are nought for one and this is proving a very quick match so far.A wicket at Edgbaston and a vital one for Warwickshire as skipper Jeetan Patel removes Steven Crook for an enterprising 92. It wasn’t exactly one for the highlights reel, with a ball spinning down leg nibbled behind: some sharp work by Tim Ambrose the stumps. Crook’s stand of 122 with Doug Bracewell equalled a record 8th wicket partnership for the visitors against the Bears. Northants are a much healthier looking 225 for eight now.Notts are all out for 133 at Trent Bridge, with Graham Onions and Tom Bailey finishing with three wickets apiece and Jimmy Anderson, back to a more natural colour of hair, two. It’s fair to say that the two meetings so far this season between Notts and Lancashire haven’t been ones for batsmen. Surrey, meanwhile, are 157-5. Ollie Pope has 36 of them. Steven Crook is playing a gem of an innings at Edgbaston in what is proving a fine partnership of 106 runs with Doug Bracewell to see Northants 208 for seven from 47 overs. Warwickshire have been on the attack, naturally, but so two have this pair, slapping 23 fours between them. Crook is unbeaten on 83 and Bracewell is on 54. Olly Stone started brightly but has struggled a bit after the break, with only the odd venomous delivery in between some loose stuff. Breakthrough for Yorkshire as Joe Root bowls Dean Elgar for 61, playing all round one and losing his leg stump. Surrey are 137-5 now with Ollie Pope their last recognised batsman unbeaten on 30. All happening at Trent Bridge. Two wickets for Jimmy Anderson and a Samit Patel run out. Notts are 122-7 against Lancashire.Alastair Cook has gone for 37 at New Road, driving at Joe Leach and edging to first slip. A angry swish at the turf follows. Essex are 68-3 against the Pears. Here, Surrey are 113-4 with Jonny Bairstow standing up to the stumps for Steve Patterson. Dean Elgar has 42 and Ollie Pope 19. Surrey head into lunch at 92-4, losing Ben Foakes 25 minutes before the break – caught behind off Steve Patterson, with a touch of out-swing enticing him into playing forwards defensively. He fell for 18. South African Dean Elgar is holding the innings together with an unbeaten 37, not something that will particularly please new national selector Ed Smith, who would have hoped for more success from the likes of Stoneman, Foakes and even Rory Burns.It is a similar story at Trent Bridge, where Nottinghamshire are 80-4 in the 30th against Lancashire. Graham Onions has three wickets, while Jordan Clark has just removed Jake Libby on the stroke of lunch. Haseeb Hameed is back in Lancashire’s team having been dropped against Somerset last week. Essex have reached 64-2 against Worcestershire at New Road, with Alastair Cook unbeaten on 34.In Division Two, there are healthy starts for Derbyshire against Durham (107-0), Kent against Sussex (97-2) and Middlesex against Gloucestershire (121-1). Nick Gubbins is unbeaten on 70 for the latter. Leicestershire are 62-5 against Glamorgan at Grace Road. No shortage of entertainment at Taunton on what is likely to be a shortened day. Hampshire are 111-3 at lunch. The two captains have caught the eye. James Vince always does and there were some silky drives, one lofted against Jack Leach, in his 43-ball 44, which included 10 boundaries. Less predictably Tom Abell, filling the fourth seamer role very effectively, has 2-18 from 7 overs. He has found late swing and the edge of Vince’s bat on a rare moment when the Hampshire captain was defending. Somerset have their two spinners playing but in four overs there was no sign of turn. The faster bowlers have been profligate, maybe feeling the pressure of the captain having inserted the opposition. They bowled with far less discipline than against Worcestershire and Yorkshire earlier in the season. This may be a used pitch (they defeated Yorkshire on it) but it still possesses some life for the quicker bowlers.Marcus Trescothick is alive and well. He hobbled up to the press area to do a little commentary on BBC radio. He will have an operation on Monday and is, of course, optimistic about an early return. (He’s thinking July, everyone else reckons August is more realistic). And there is a sighting of Jamie Overton bowling on the edge of the square.It has been a breathless morning at Edgbaston, where Northants go into the lunch break with a near run-a-minute 118 but for the loss of seven wickets. Little doubt as to who the start of the morning has been, with Henry Brookes, 18, picking up three and effecting a run out from long leg with a slingshot throw. Olly Stone has bowled with good heat on his comeback from injury and picked up two, nicking off Adam Rossington first ball and then ending a counter-attacking stand of 50 from Steven Crook and Josh Cobb when the latter slapped to point on 29. Crook is unbeaten on 43, having made use of the attacking fields, but this pitch is no minefield so there is a whole heap of work to be done after vittles. Early indications suggest it’s not the usual batting paradise here at the Oval, with Dean Elgar doing well to keep out a Steve Patterson delivery which kept low just now. Surrey have advanced to 60-3 in the 20th over. If Elgar, who has 27, and Ben Foakes (nine) can navigate the rest of the morning without further damage, that will be a good result for the home side. As Ali watches wickets tumble at Edgbaston, it’s a similar case at Grace Road, where Leicestershire are 39-4 against Glamorgan, for whom Timm van der Gugten has a couple of wickets. After 45 frustrating minutes when Somerset bowled four no-balls and a few four balls, as well as dropping a regulation catch at second slip (“old Tresco would have caught that one”, but Matt Renshaw could not hold on), the home side has a wicket. Jimmy Adams was, as they say, adjudged caught behind off Tim Groenewald, and departed grumpily.Out came James Vince and to his second ball he played that shot and the ball flew at catchable height to third slip. There was no third slip. Since then he has played that shot more effectively and he’s raced to 27 in no time. Somerset are looking ragged and there may be a few old timers in the Colin Atkinson Pavilion shaking their heads – it’s the old players’ dinner tonight.Tom Abell, flushed by his success at Lancashire, is having a bowl, not a good sign for the home side. Hampshire are racing along at five over. Maybe that Ali Martin was right.Hang on. Abell just dismissed Weatherley for 28. Now it’s Abell against Amla. And Leach is having a bowl. 86-2Wowsers. Olly Stone enters the attack and strikes first ball with a beauty to find the edge of Adam Rossington’s bat. Fast, nipped away, found the edge of a straight defensive shot off the back foot and Northants are 47 for five, with Henry Brookes have taken two earlier and pulled off a run out to boot. Warwickshire breathing fire right now.A couple of key wickets already for Yorkshire, who have got rid of Mark Stoneman and Rory Burns – one man who is fighting to hold onto his England opening berth and the other who has made a pretty strong case to pinch it. Stoneman was lbw playing forwards at Tim Bresnan for 10 and Burns caught at first slip off a Jack Brooks’ beauty for nine. Surrey are 23-2. Swing on offer and a bit of nibble. Meanwhile, Nottinghamshire are 17-1 against Lancashire at Trent Bridge, with Steven Mullaney falling against his former county, and Essex are 21-1 against Worcestershire at New Road. Varun Chopra was the man to depart. Alluding to Vic’s earlier post ... here’s a bit of pointless but fascinating trivia on the origins of Somerset Day. Cheese lovers take note: there’s an official twitter account and hampers of cheese seem to be available to win!Henry Brookes is making some impression here at Edgbaston, with two wickets in two overs to follow the initial breakthrough from Chris Wright and leave Northants in a state of disarray at 20 for three after six overs. Wright had Ben Duckett caught behind off an inside edge before Brookes bowled Alex Wakeley with a beauty. Just nipped away a touch and trimmed the off bail. The 18-year-old, whose action is effortlessly smooth, then had Richard Levi caught at slip to another leg-cutter, as Richie Benaud would say. Marvellous effort that.It is absolutely perishing here in Malahide. I’m not sure I’ve ever been any colder at a cricket ground. So I thought I’d chip in with an update just to get the blood flowing through my fingers. The weather’s actually better than it was this morning, or at least the light has improved. But it’s still spitting, so the covers are on. The umpires are making a cursory inspection as I write this. In terms of team news, Pakistan say they’re going to play the same side that turned out against Northants, which means Imam-ul-Haq will make his debut, and they’ve a long tail, with Shadab Khan batting at No7. We know most of Ireland’s side, but haven’t heard whether they are going to pick a spinner or not. In the meantime, the players are skulking in the pavilion, the groundstaff are scurrying around trying to keep everything dry, and the fans are huddled in the stands with their hoods up. Welcome to Test cricket, Ireland. Bit of a surprise here, as Yorkshire opt for an uncontested toss and elect to bowl first. As expected, Alex Lees has come into their team in place of Gary Ballance, while Josh Shaw has come in for the injured Ben Coad, who misses out with an ankle problem. Dean Elgar returns for Surrey in place of Ryan Patel following a commitment in South Africa which forced him out of the recent Worcestershire draw here. Jade Dernbach returns in place of Stuart Meaker. A collector’s item at Taunton. Hampshire obviously wanted to bat first (a used wicket is being used for this game) so insisted upon a toss, which was duly held. Somerset won the toss and promptly put Hampshire in. So the toss was unnecessary after all.Dom Bess, who was not in the squad announced on the eve of the game, is in the team so Somerset are playing two spinners. No Mason Crane for Hampshire yet and Liam Dawson is injured.The press box is filling up on “Somerset Day” and there is great anticipation after two home victories, wins that must have come as a bit of a surprise to my esteemed colleague at Edgbaston, who had Somerset relegated in his pre-season predictions. He may yet be proven right. But he’s not completely infallible (it’s Middle Chinnock). If he happens to be wrong, I may remind him come September.Sadly they predict rain sometime in the afternoon, but the forecast not too bad thereafter.We have had a toss at Edgbaston and Northants are batting with the sun breaking through the haze. Olly Stone has indeed got the nod against his old club, so looking forward to seeing him steam in and a look at young Henry Brookes too. Highly thought of. Good morning from the Oval, where we have news. Joe Root will be captaining Yorkshire this weekend following the late withdrawal of regular captain Gary Ballance through illness.Ballance was feeling unwell and did not train with his White Rose team-mates when they arrived in London yesterday afternoon. He was assessed last night and sent home to Leeds.This will be Root’s fourth match in charge of Yorkshire in the County Championship, with the other three all coming in their title-winning season of 2014. His first was that record chase by Middlesex at Lord’s when Chris Rogers hit a double century in pursuit of 472, with him earning the nickname ‘craptain’ from his England team-mates. He then lifted the title at Nottinghamshire later in the season and skippered against Somerset, with Andrew Gale banned following a verbal altercation with Ashwell Prince in a Roses match.Alex Lees has replaced Ballance in Yorkshire’s squad and will likely open the batting. Surrey come into this match with a win and two draws from their first three matches, while Yorkshire have won two and drawn two.County cricket live is back, for what is the fifth round of matches and the last before the season switches to 50-over cricket for a spell. It’s also the final audition for any England hopefuls before Ed Smith sits down with Trevor Bayliss and Joe Root next Tuesday to pick their Test squad to face Pakistan, if national team #narrative is your thing.Anyway, greetings from a fresh and dry Edgbaston where Division Two pace-setters Warwickshire host Northamptonshire – a team they brushed aside by an innings and 48 runs at Wantage Road just three weeks ago. Be interesting to see if ex-Steelback Olly Stone, one of those hoping to catch Smith’s eye, gets a run out. The talk is it may be too soon after a hamstring twang. We’ll see.Vic Marks, meanwhile, is at Taunton. Social media tells me it’s Somerset Day today, so expect East Chinnock’s finest to take us on a stirring journey from Wookey Hole to the as-yet-constructed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station while he watches Tom Abell’s second-placed side take on Hampshire. My dud prediction of seventh for his old team will probably get an airing too. Groan.Elsewhere in Division One the battle of the blonds take place at Trent Bridge, where table-topping Nottinghamshire host Lancashire (champions-elect as per another shrewd call by yours truly) in a match that pits Stuart Broad against the peroxide pilferer Jimmy Anderson. Both were resting when the two teams met at Old Trafford in the first round and Notts gloriously romped to their fourth innings target of 10 just four wickets down.Graham Hardcastle is also on duty at the Oval, where Yorkshire take on Surrey after their epic win over Essex in the last round, while lowly Worcestershire host the champions at New Road. In Division Two, Mark Wood is back for Durham after being released early by Chennai Superkings and will be in the XI that takes on Derbyshire away, Jason Gillespie’s Sussex, as they are seemingly now known, are at south coast neighbours Kent, Leicestershire host Glamorgan and Middlesex, perhaps featuring Steven Finn and Eoin Morgan for the first time this season, play Gloucestershire at Lord’s. If Morgan plays it will end a near three-year first-class hiatus. Have a great day, all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a43d694ecf6e2e168e00f52358176845b7f906/77_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c136b8e25e2cd9c0f2af21504c53701","title":"nine endorphin boosting ideas to get you outdoors this spring and summer","story":"Time outdoors has a hugely positive impact on our mental health and wellbeing. Whether you fancy paddleboarding around the coast or zipwiring across the treetops, here’s how to unlock a healthier, happier you this spring and summerFrom reducing blood pressure to alleviating symptoms of depression, countless studies have proved that being outdoors and in contact with nature is beneficial for both physical and mental health. In these milder months, there’s no excuse not to be outside as much as possible. Here are nine ideas for inspiration.Ride a waveThe north Cornwall coast, with its big Atlantic seas, is Britain’s premier surf destination, with Fistral beach at Newquay probably the country’s best-known surf beach. But there are great places to learn to surf all around the UK. If you’re after a board experience with a less steep learning curve, stand-up paddleboarding offers the chance to take to the water in an easy-to-learn fashion. As well as the exhilaration of surfing the waves, paddleboarding can be a means of exploring the wonders of Britain’s tranquil inland waterways.Get started: Surfing England (surfingengland.org) has information on surf clubs and learning to surf. The British Stand Up Paddle Association website (bsupa.org.uk) has information on where to learn.See colours in bloomSpring and summer are the best times to explore England’s most glorious gardens. Among the Royal Horticultural Society’s (RHS) stunners is its flagship garden, Wisley in Surrey. Home to one of the world’s largest plant collections, it’s a riot of flowering bulbs and blossoms in spring, with fragrant roses and colourful mixed borders in summer. The RHS also runs summer flower shows around the country, including the world-famous Chelsea flower show. The National Trust is  to more than 200 gardens and landscaped parks, many attached to its historic houses, with Studley Royal water gardens at Fountains Abbey, also a world heritage site, among the best known.Freewheel through forest trailsZip along peaceful country lanes between summer hedgerows, pedal past glowering mountains above Scotland’s Glencoe pass as part of a tour or expedition, race with other cyclists, or even head off-road along forest trails on a mountain bike. Cycling can provide high-adrenaline sport or light, relaxing exercise, but whichever way you ride, getting on a bike gives you an up-close view of the countryside that you’d never get from a car.Get started: Cycling UK (cyclinguk.org) can help you get on the road, with advice on everything from buying a bike to cycling groups and routes.Escape to the countryCity dwellers craving a rural fix should seek out one of the many regional annual outdoor shows, a celebration of farming and rural life, with sheep and cattle competitions, horse and dog shows, sheep-shearing contests and farm machinery displays. These days, though, the events are also packed with family-friendly entertainments, ranging from air displays and carriage-driving races to skateboarding and marching bands. Local producers showcase their food and drink, and makers display arts and crafts.Get started:UK County Shows (ukcountyshows) has countrywide information and links to inidual shows.Swim in scenic surroundingsWhat could be a more perfect summer idyll than plunging into a cool lake or river on a hot, sunny day? Wild swimming – taking a dip in rivers, lakes, streams and waterfalls – has a growing number of fans. Popular spots to swim include Ullswater in the Lake District and lochs throughout Scotland, while rivers in the Brecon Beacons are home to stunning waterfall plunge pools. In the south of England, Pangbourne on the river Thames is one of many popular locations, and there are even urban swims to be had in London’s Serpentine and Highgate ponds.Get started: There’s information on locations throughout the UK and all-important safety tips tips at wildswimming.Soar into the treetopsThere’s a special kind of thrill to hurtling through the treetops suspended on a wire. Locations range from urban parks (such as Heaton Park in Manchester and Battersea Park in London) to mountains and forests. Zip World, with locations in Wales, offers a variety of adventures through forest, over a quarry and even – this one’s for the fitter and more adventurous – underground in caverns. Go Ape has locations throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and a collection of mainly forest-based attractions.Kayak along the waterwaysBritain has thousands of miles of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and canals canoeing (single-ended paddle), or kayaking (double-ended paddle), is a great way to explore them. Assuming you don’t have your own canoe, you’ll need to join a club or go to an activity centre, where staff will generally help new paddlers with an induction session. Sea kayaking is a lot of fun, too, and more experienced paddlers may enjoy canoe polo (just as it sounds) or white-water canoeing. Get started: British Canoeing (britishcanoeing.org.uk) has information on canoe clubs and activity centres around the country, and on canoe hire.Walk this wayWhether it’s a Sunday stroll or a serious hike, there’s no simpler – or cheaper – way to explore Britain’s great outdoors than on foot. The British countryside is laced with public footpaths all you need to get going is a pair of walking boots or sturdy trainers (plus a map and weatherproof gear if you’re going far). Among myriad footpaths, 16 national trails pass through some of the country’s most iconic landscapes.

These days the biggest international names (from Beyoncé to Ed Sheeran) vie to play them: there’s no other way to see so many top artists in a single location.

A good nosy at their previously unseen personal possessions and artefacts, that’s what. This summer, that’s exactly what London’s V\u0026ampA museum delivers in the much-anticipated Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up. The majority of this collection of jewellery, letters, photographs and items from her wardrobe (including hand-painted corsets) was only recently discovered, having been shut away for 50 years since her death. Consider this essential for demystifying the Mexican artist and sartorial icon, and it’s a lot cheaper than going all the way to Mexico. Granted, the exhibition is indoors, but you can combine your visit with a stop-off at the V\u0026ampA’s garden cafe, a hidden oasis in the centre of the museum, where you can sit at one of the courtyard tables or picnic on the lawn.vam.ac.uk from 16 JuneArrange a bouquet of flowersYou don’t have to be embarking on a second career as a florist to appreciate a beautifully arranged bunch of flowers, although a workshop at The Narcissus Flower School in Edinburgh could well send you in that direction. From learning to hand-tie a spring wedding bouquet to perfecting a festival-ready floral crown, this is the place to go this summer for cutting-edge botanical design. The highlight in the programme has to be The Foragers Garden Party workshop, which caters to all al fresco needs, from rustic barbecues to afternoon tea.

Amid all the content, though, the streaming site has steadily made its own canon of true-crime documentaries, owing to an array of innately fascinating subjects that lend themselves to binge-watching.First there was Making a Murderer, which cast doubt on a Wisconsin man’s conviction, followed by The Keepers, about the unsolved murder of a nun, and Wild, Wild Country, the story of the Oregon-based Rajneeshpuram sex cult. Now, Mark and Jay Duplass, the producers of Wild, Wild Country, boast a second, equally strange true-crime hit: Evil Genius, the bizarre tale of the “pizza bomber” heist in the appropriately named town of Erie, Pennsylvania.It begins, as those watching the news in the late summer of 2003 will remember, with a rather fruitless bank robbery: a pizza delivery man named Brian Wells walked into a PNC bank in Erie with a metal bomb collared to his neck and a cane-like shotgun in tow. Making off with about $8,000, Wells was apprehended shortly afterward in a nearby parking lot, where he told surrounding cops that the bomb around his neck was live. Incredulous witnesses heard a continuous “tick-tock”, and then it detonated, lodging shrapnel in Wells’ chest and killing him. In Wells’ car, though, authorities recovered notes that laid out a scavenger hunt, suggesting he was just a cog in an elaborate criminal machine.“I learned about it the night that it happened,” says Trey Borzillieri, the creator of Evil Genius, who’s spent more than a decade investigating the heist and its aftermath. “I was in Buffalo, which is very close to Erie, and I saw it become an international story. You’ve basically got Brian Wells delivering that pizza and then showing up at a PNC bank and robbing it. They start the investigation, then a month later there’s a body in a freezer right next to the road he made the last delivery to.“At the time, you knew this was a major story,” he adds. “So that was the moment I decided to embark on this documentary.”Borzillieri, who last year produced a docu-series on the Zodiac killer, would make the acquaintance of a remarkably idiosyncratic cast of characters along the way, none more compelling than Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, the owl-eyed local pseudo-celebrity known for a streak of suborned, and often murdered, ex-boyfriends. An erstwhile beauty queen and musical prodigy diagnosed with bipolar disorder and mania, Diehl-Armstrong is the undisputed star of Evil Genius, if not exactly its subject, a shrewd manipulator who’s more Nannie Doss than Aileen Wuornos.“She’s very smart people would call her brilliant,” says Barbara Schroeder, who joined Borzillieri on the project in 2013. Schroeder, who wrote and directed the documentary Talhotblond, about an internet love triangle that goes south, was intrigued by the access her collaborator got to Diehl-Armstrong, whose first on-camera interview is featured in Evil Genius.“She was able to get men to do her bidding and put them under her spell,” Schroeder says. “I’m an experienced journalist, so when Trey was telling me he had years of phone calls with someone who might be the mastermind, that was just astonishing. I started listening to the audio that he got and it was just riveting.” Borzillieri and Diehl-Armstrong established a relationship before she was a public suspect, which meant she often used him as a sounding board to profess her innocence. Nevertheless, she was still a wildcard. After one phone conversation with Borzillieri, she told him: “I’ll sue your fucking balls off.” In another, she signed off with: “Love ya!” Borzillieri says: “They weren’t easy conversations, but a lot of truth was revealed … She was such a narcissist that she always believed people would believe her side of the story.”Weeks after the Wells heist, local law enforcement received a call from Bill Rothstein, a kind of Falstaff in overalls. Portly and gregarious, Rothstein was another ex-boyfriend of Diehl-Armstrong’s who lived nextdoor to the site of Wells’s final delivery and alerted authorities to the body of James Roden, which was frozen stiff in a freezer in his garage. Roden, too, was an ex of Diehl-Armstrong’s.“The case was cold, and it looked like Rothstein would be a definite suspect,” Borzillieri recalls. “The fact that the body was the live-in boyfriend of Marjorie’s at the time, you thought this had to be connected. But when the FBI said that it wasn’t, that’s what really compelled me to get off the couch and start knocking on doors.”Mostly, those doors begat more doors. Rich Shapiro, whose 2010 Wired exposé examines the heist comprehensively, told Borzillieri and Schroeder he needed a flow chart just to keep things straight. So, to make Evil Genius, the pair stayed faithful to chronology. They were inspired, first, by Paradise Lost, the celebrated documentary about the West Memphis Three, and second by the philosophical principle of Occam’s razor, which posits that the simplest approach is usually the best.“It was like a labyrinth, because there is more to the story than just Brian’s death,” Schroeder says. “It could have been written a lot of different ways, but we kept it really simple: here’s the heist, here’s the frozen body, here are the suspects, and here are the confessions. We thought it would be the most engaging way for people to follow Trey’s journey and these social misfits who basically outplayed the FBI.”Among the many subnarratives coursing through the docuseries, which touches on issues of class stratification and mental illness, is the tension between the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and local law enforcement, whose collective attempts to solve the mystery of the heist were marred by a lack of forensic evidence, the deaths of key witnesses, and their own internecine disputes. “This is the first time that many of these investigators have gone on camera to tell their story,” says Borzillieri. “Because of the sensitive nature of this case, all law enforcement you see interviewed waited until they were retired to speak.”The access Borzillieri secured, including unprecedented on-camera interviews with law enforcement, Diehl-Armstrong, and a key witness who surfaces in the fourth episode, reflected the kind of genuine, leather-shoe reporting he conducted from the get-go. “Even though he’s a citizen journalist, I enjoyed working with him more than a lot of other colleagues throughout my career,” says Schroeder. “The first time anybody tells their story, if you catch that on camera, that’s a pretty special moment. To Trey’s credit, it’s good old-fashioned journalism.”Borzillieri and Schroeder are happy that Evil Genius landed at Netflix, where true-crime junkies will be able to binge all four episodes in full. “We’re grateful to get that many eyeballs on this one-of-a-kind crime,” says Schroeder, “and, creatively, to be able to tell the story the way it should be told.”“I would add that, embarking on this, there weren’t a lot of documentary series at the time,” Borzillieri notes. “There was a lot of blind faith on my part. Making a Murderer revolutionized this kind of film-making and, in essence, I no longer look like a crazy person carrying a project like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97b99487b29a17d6d7effaa9137f1db8af44bf9/0_219_6435_3860/master/6435.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71409be38d2b603e0bcdb8139250c013","title":"royal wedding pub washington dc pop up","story":"A pop-up bar is offering ‘Markle Sparkle’ cocktails and a mock-up of the Buckingham Palace throne room for anglophiles and wannabe princessesThe Beatles are being blasted over the pub’s loudspeaker, and the boisterous bar crowd are enjoying “Markle Sparkle” cocktails.The walls are adorned with pink and white floral arrangements – and the kitchen is being guarded by a statue of a Beefeater, the ceremonial guards more often spotted protecting the Tower of London.This is the Royal Wedding Pub, a pop-up bar in Washington DC that has been created to capture excitement about the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, an American actor, on 19 May.“I hate to use cliches, but it’s like that fairytale thing where the commoner girl meets the prince,” says Megan Biggins, a local resident who along with three of her friends has donned a fascinator hat for the outing to the pub.It has already drawn hundreds of patrons each evening since its official launch earlier this month, with the most devoted willing to queue up, sometimes for hours. The temporary venue has a fan-vaulted ceiling and stained glass, modeled after St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle where Prince Harry was christened and will marry his bride. The Royal Wedding Pub is the latest creation by Drink Company, a group behind other viral pop-ups that included pubs inspired by Game of Thrones and Washington’s annual cherry blossom festival. The “Markle Sparkle” is one of the most popular drinks – a twist on an Aperol spritz with rose cider and edible glitter. Twiglets are among the snacks. “She’s the first American princess. We’ve got to pay homage to her,” says Matt Fox, the special projects director at Drink Company.Paul Taylor, the company’s head of bar concepts, says the team dove “down the rabbit hole” to get every detail right. “The names of the cocktails are important, the ingredients are important, the glassware is important,” he says.The “When Harry Met Meghan” cocktail is served in a royal wedding collector’s mug. The scotch-based drink is made with ginger, a cheeky reference to Prince Harry’s hair, and banana. The latter, Taylor says, is a favorite of the couple’s.With drink in hand, visitors congregate inside a recreation of the Buckingham Palace throne room, replete with red and gold curtains. Pub-goers wrap themselves in a red velvet robe and pose for pictures with a stuffed corgi, as cardboard cutouts of Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Queen Elizabeth herself flank the two thrones.The Royal Wedding Pub has drawn a range of patrons, most of them young women, from self-confessed anglophiles to fans of the Netflix series The Crown. Some simply want to see what all the fuss is about.Pamela Boundy is the embodiment of an American aficionado of the royal family, holding court at the corner of the bar in a gold paper crown that comes as a keepsake with a cocktail aptly named God Save the Queen.A resident of Midland, Michigan, she is visiting her daughter in Washington and is planning a watch party at her home for the royal nuptials at 4.30am local time in DC.“We have a red carpet and everybody dresses up for the occasion,” says Boundy. “My husband dresses up in a tuxedo and plays the butler. We serve an English breakfast and clotted cream.”The family hosted a similar affair when Prince William wed Kate Middleton, but the idea of an American princess has ramped up their excitement.“It’s about time,” Boundy says.On the big day itself, when Prince Harry and Markle are to officially wed, the Royal Wedding Pub plans to open doors first thing in the morning for a watch party. All of the day’s proceeds will go to the Invictus Games Foundation, the international sporting event founded by Prince Harry for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women.One thing US TV viewers of the wedding apparently won’t see, though, is Donald Trump or Barack Obama – who is friends with Prince Harry – attending the event, after it emerged there would be no official political invitations.

Guilherme Boulos has never stood for political office of any kind, but he is somehow now aiming for the very top job. “Clearly, it’s a David v Goliath battle,” the 35-year-old social activist admits of his unlikely quest to become Brazil’s youngest ever president. “But it’s something that we must face.”Polls leave no doubt that Boulos – who is running alongside indigenous activist Sônia Guajajara for the leftist Socialism and Liberty party – has a wafer-thin chance of achieving his goal when Latin America’s biggest democracy votes on 7 October. In the longer term, however, the São Paulo-born politician’s prospects look far brighter. As Brazil’s crisis-stricken left comes to terms with the sidelining of its torchbearer, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Boulos is being touted as a potential successor – not least by Lula himself.In his last public speech before being jailed last month, Lula clutched Boulos’s hand and urged supporters to take note of this “companheiro of the highest quality”. Turning to Boulos next to him on stage, Lula added: “You’ve got a bright future, brother, just don’t ever give up.”Lula made no fewer than five allusions to the activist during that parting address, Piauí magazine noted in a recent profile proclaiming Boulos “o herdeiro” or “the heir”: “Nobody was mentioned or praised as much.”Boulos, who shares Lula’s eventually relinquished love of smoking and the Corinthians football club as well as his legendary charisma, has downplayed that nickname, while recognising parallels between his 16-year struggle for social justice with the Homeless Workers’ Movement (MTST) and Lula’s championing of the poor. “Only the dead have heirs,” Boulos said during a high-profile television interview this week.But that widely applauded TV appearance only intensified chatter over Boulos’s status as Lula’s inheritor. In an article headlined “The Star is Born”, political journalist Luis Nassif celebrated “the birth of a national leader”. Leonardo Boff, a leftist theologian and longtime Lula confidant, seconded the emotion, tweeting: “You are a new leadership in Brazil.” During a recent interview with the  – conducted while clattering around Rio in the back of a silver Honda compact – Boulos spoke of his desire to lead a long-term renewal of Brazil’s left, a movement at a crossroads after losing its leader of nearly four decades. He insisted his presidential bid was a genuine attempt to gain power and hoped the anti-systemic frustrations rippling across the globe might boost his campaign. “People are tired of the the same old marketing tricks. People no longer have faith in the old ways of doing politics. This opens up an possibility,” said Boulos. “This is an election in which anything is possible.”Boulos said combating “pornographic” levels of inequality would be his priority as president. “Brazil is the world’s seventh biggest economy and yet also one of the 10 most unequal,” he said as his car sped past Jacarezinho, a vast redbrick favela, on its way to the family home of murdered Rio councillor Marielle Franco. “Brazil isn’t just one country,” Boulos added that afternoon. “Brazil is a fissure. Brazil is an abyss.”On the campaign trail, Boulos, who holds a master’s in psychiatry from one of Brazil’s top universities, has been doing plenty of that. After spending the morning with Franco’s sister and parents, he set off for a round table discussion with leftwing artists and activists who served up a bewildering smorgasbord of demands.One called for academic quotas for Brazil’s transgender community another demanded action against tyrannical media oligopolies a third protested that the swimming pool of a local state school had become a dumping site for old sofas and dead dogs.“We must roll up our sleeves, hang our pants on the washing line and demand from the government what is ours!” a fourth petitioner bellowed to furrowed brows and giggles.Throughout the meandering session Boulos sat attentively taking notes before ending with a brief but rousing address delivered in a silky baritone not unlike that of his incarcerated political patron.The would-be president railed against corruption, racism, gender discrimination, the “stupid” war on drugs and the failings of Brazil’s inward-looking left which spent too much time “preaching to the converted”.“We’re in a moment of transition. We’re entering a new cycle,” intoned Boulos, whose purple T-shirt carried the words of the German playwright Bertolt Brecht: “Nothing should seem impossible to change.” When Lula’s increasingly apparent heir concluded he was cheered off the stage and mobbed for selfies. Back in his Honda and heading to Rio’s airport, Boulos said his travels around Brazil had convinced him the country needed a leader capable of hearing “the clamour of the people”. “Perhaps one of the characteristics of our failed political system is that it is deaf … Politics is full of people who can come out and make big speeches … but someone who wants to govern a country must really know that country and listening is essential to knowing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e0f3130b4832009d9b0cbb2d40b4b1a4ff6bdb9/0_395_3715_2228/master/3715.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=976932b1c29701ba7f0c5d948a3894f7","title":"europe prepares countermeasures against us iran sanctions","story":"Senior politicians says Europe will consider countermeasures to keep trading with IranEurope is prepared to introduce measures to nullify the effect of Donald Trump imposing sanctions on any non-US firm that continues to do business with Iran, the French government has said.The warning from the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, suggests Trump’s proposals to corral Europe into joining US foreign policy on Iran may lead to a severe backlash by EU firms and politicians, especially advocates of a stronger independent European foreign policy.“We have to work among ourselves in Europe to defend our European economic sovereignty,” Le Maire said, adding that Europe could use the same instruments as the US to defend its interests.When Trump announced he was pulling the US out of the Iran nuclear deal he said the US was also reimposing sanctions, including on any entity that continued to trade with Iran, in effect threatening billions of euros of European business.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.The US Treasury has said it is giving companies three to six months to wind down their contracts, including purchases of Iranian oil.Le Maire said: “At the end of May I will meet with the British and German finance ministers and the three of us will look at what we can do.”He disclosed that he had called the US treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, on Wednesday, urging him to allow exemptions for French companies or a delay in implementing the sanctions, while admitting he had “few illusions” about the likely response.Le Maire pointed to the possibility of reinstating EU “blocking regulations”, dating back to 1996, which were used to counter US sanctions that targeted third countries doing business with Libya.The statute permitted European companies to ignore the US sanctions and said that any decisions by foreign courts based on the sanctions would not be upheld in Europe. The US backed down before any sanctions were implemented. “We want to reinforce this regulation and incorporate the recent decisions taken by the United States,” Le Maire said. “The second avenue is looking at Europe’s financial independence – what can we do to give Europe more financial tools allowing it to be independent from the United States?” One proposal is to set up a purely European finance house to oversee euro-denominated transactions with Iran.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said possibilities to save the deal without Washington needed to be discussed with Tehran, while economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said Germany was ready to give help to its affected firms, including legal advice, to continue doing business in Iran. The new US ambassador to Germany was forced on to the defensive this week after sending out a tweet telling German businesses they should wind down their links with Iran. Richard Grenell said he had been issuing advice, not instructions, and his remarks derived from a Washington memo.Omid Nouripour, the Green foreign policy spokesperson in the German parliament, advised Grenell against “driving a ruthless aggressive policy towards our security interests”. The Social Democrats said Grenell needed tutoring in diplomacy. In Italy, Nathalie Tocci, an adviser to the EU external affairs chief, Federica Mogerini, said Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran deal was “an utter and unjustified betrayal of Europe”. She called for proportionate reprisals if necessary. European ministers are to meet their Iranian counterparts on Monday to reassure them they intend to preserve the nuclear deal, and resist US sanctions being imposed on European firms trading with Iran. The EU and US combined to impose sanctions against Iran between 2012 and 2015. After the Iran deal was struck in 2015, the Obama administration worked with European banks to reassure them that some US sanctions that remained in force did not restrict the rights of European business. The former US ambassador to Italy, David Thorne, said Trump’s decision had the potential to cause the biggest rift between the US and mainland Europe since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Europe needed to produce a counter-package against the US, including penalties against assets of US companies based in Europe to allow for clawback of illegal fines imposed. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, apparently anxious to avoid a deepening rift with the US, has not criticised the principle of extra-territorial sanctions, simply saying he will work with European partners to do his utmost to protect British business. The UK is not as heavily involved in Iranian trade as France, Germany and Italy, partly because UK finance houses are so strongly interwined with the US, and therefore vulnerable to fines if they are deemed to have breached sanctions.The sanctions policy gives the US Treasury considerable latitude to interpret whether a firm is doing its best to unravel its business links, but previous fines for alleged breaches led many firms to err on the side of caution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6f54626a9be937f38a20f1bcf1d20ad71a1599e/0_84_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c6d97f4b93b0dee3fe9258a701b117e","title":"us embassy opening israel at 70","story":"Move from Tel Aviv to Israel is celebrated in land where ‘Netanyahu is king and Trump is a god’Flowers – red, white and blue – form the image of the US flag on the road leading up to the site of the new American mission in Jerusalem. “US embassy” signs have been hoisted in the neighbourhood. The US embassy Twitter account – previously in Tel Aviv as @usembassytlv – is now @usembassyjlm.All is set for the inauguration on Monday, an opening charged with symbolism that its organisers anticipate will set off a wave of euphoria across the Jewish state 70 years since it declared independence on 14 May 1948.Hundreds of guests will attend, alongside a White House delegation led by John Sullivan, US deputy secretary of state, and including the much higher-profile Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner.For Israel’s prime minister, the embassy move is seen as one of two gifts from Donald Trump to the country, the other being his exit this week from the Iran nuclear deal that will reimpose sanctions on Benjamin Netanyahu’s arch-enemy.Yet a celebratory atmosphere masks a particularly feverish time for Israel, even, some say, by historical standards.To Israel’s south, the army has been lambasted internationally for its lethal response to Palestinian protests that have not relented for weeks. To the north, and for the first time in decades, the country is facing the possibility of on-off interstate war.Trump’s decision to recognise the holy city as Israel’s capital was made in stark defiance of long-held international consensus that the status of ided Jerusalem should be negotiated with the Palestinians.Senior Palestinian official Nabil Shaath, speaking near the site of the new embassy, said Trump was “siding totally with Israeli annexation and Israeli cleansing of our people from Jerusalem”.As the US president’s daughter attends the pomp, less than 60 miles away, a six-week protest spurred on by anger and desperation at Trump’s embassy decision is expected to culminate in a mass demonstration in Gaza.Next week has added significance for millions of Palestinians, who will mark seven decades since the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people who either fled or were forced from their homes during the war surrounding Israel’s creation.Gaza’s protesters have vowed to break through the perimeter fence despite the presence of Israeli snipers deployed on sandbanks behind it.The Gaza-based leader of Hamas, which rules the enclave, said the rallies would be peaceful but would not be held back. “What’s the problem if hundreds of thousands storm this fence which is not a border of a state?” Yahya Sinwar said, claiming the frontier was not internationally recognised.Israel’s use of live ammunition against unarmed masses has killed dozens of Palestinians, including journalists, and wounded around 1,700, including children shot in the legs. In stark contrast to that of the White House, the general international reaction to the Israeli army’s actions has been condemnatory. In a separate move defying global allies, Trump effectively pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Tuesday, a decision that has shaken an already turbulent Middle East.On Thursday, Israel accused Tehran’s forces of launching a barrage of rockets at its troops in the occupied Golan Heights. Iran did not confirm it had fired but the incident follows reports of multiple unclaimed and surreptitious Israeli strikes on Tehran’s outposts in Syria this year.Saying it was retaliating against the rockets, Israel launched a massive operation on its Arab neighbour – the largest in Syria since the early 70s.The Israel Defence Forces claimed its missiles hit nearly all key Iranian military targets in Syria during dozens of strikes. The operation, nicknamed “house of cards”, was lauded by unnamed military officials in local media as a huge success against its enemies.Ahead of the embassy opening, others have cautioned against jubilation over the US pullout of the Iran deal and the Israeli attack in Syria.“In Israel these days, Benjamin Netanyahu is king and Donald Trump is a god. Adrenaline is flowing through the nation’s veins and testosterone could soon spill over,” wrote Chemi Shalev, the US editor for the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz.Iran’s foreign ministry said the raids in Syria were launched on “invented pretexts” and that Damascus had every right to defend itself. In a more defiant tone, a senior Iranian cleric close to the leadership, Ahmad Khatami, was quoted on state TV as saying: “We will expand our missile capabilities despite western pressure.”Ben Caspit, a prominent Israeli journalist, described a national mindset of elation in Maariv, one of the country’s oldest daily newspapers, saying if Israel were playing a football game, the score would be “10-0 in our favour”.“The problem is that the final whistle can’t be blown any more,” he wrote. “The dangerous game that we have been drawn into can turn against us at any moment. It has no set or clear rules ... The security establishment knows that this wasn’t even the first half of the game. It was barely the start.”"},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg   May 9, 2018TV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme   May 11, 2018Some of Theresa May\u0026rsquos problems stem from her relationship with the DUP "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489628.1525897181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach defends lack of communication with theresa may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with British prime minister Theresa May over the past six weeks. Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3491952.1526052171!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach apologises to women affected by cervicalcheck controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaking after a Cabinet meeting on Friday afternoon, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar insisted he first became aware of three memos circulated to HSE management in 2016 on the background to cervical screening audit findings. File photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has apologised to the women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy but admitted words cannot ease the anguish these women are experiencing.Speaking after a Cabinet meeting on Friday afternoon Mr Varadkar insisted he first became aware of three memos circulated to HSE management in 2016 on the background to cervical screening audit findings - which in many cases were not passed to the women concerned - when they were released to the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee on Thursday.The memos were also shared with the Department of Health.Politicians are learning about the extent of this at the same time the public is, Mr Varadkar said.One of the memos was dated March 2016 when Mr Varadkar was Minister for Health. It referred to the audit findings and the need to write to doctors about them, the threat of legal action over them from a laboratory which read the smears and cited next steps as pausing the distribution of letters to clinicians and awaiting the advice of solicitors.Mr Varadkar said he should have been made aware of the contents of the memo when they were known to the Department of Health.He insisted none of his advisors were made aware of the memos. Mr Harris insisted none of his ministerial advisors were informed either.Mr Varadkar stressed nobody had their cancer diagnosis withheld from them in this whole affair but vital information was concealed from women. It has already been confirmed 209 women should have received earlier intervention in their cancer diagnosis if they had got correct smear test results and that 162 of these women were not informed of the review of their case.Some 17 of the 209 are dead.At a press conference in Dublin after the Cabinet meeting Minister for Health Simon Harris was asked if he had concerns about the knowledge of the Department of Health’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan about this memos.Mr Harris said he was very annoyed that the Department of Health had knowledge but did not inform him.However, he said it was the job of the scoping inquiry now underway into the controversy to determine who knew what and when.The Government has meanwhile approved a number of measures aimed at assisting the women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy.At the Cabinet meeting, Mr Harris asked his colleagues to approve financial assistance for the 209 women or their families, who it has been determined should have received earlier intervention in their cancer diagnosis.The Cabinet agreed that the State will pay for the medical costs of those women and offer them a free medical card. There are also to be offers of free counselling.In relation to the 17 women who have died, the Government will make offers of financial assistance to their next of kin. The package is in addition to possible redress the women may receive from the State.The package includes covering childcare costs for affected women during medical appointments and transport to and from appointments.Mr Harris said women involved will be exempt from paying prescription charges and those that are using experimental drugs will have those paid for.Speaking on his way into Cabinet on Friday morning, Mr Harris said he has now ordered a trawl of documents in the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health to ensure all information is made available to the non-statutory inquiry into the affair and to Oireachtas committees.It was “not acceptable” memos like the three released on Thursday were circulating in the Department or the HSE, he said.Director general of the HSE, Tony O’Brien, stepped down on Thursday night as it became clear the Government would not continue to support him and it appeared likely the Dáil would next week pass an unprecedented motion of no confidence in him.Mr O’Brien’s position became increasingly tenuous after the dramatic release to the Dáil Public Accounts Committee of three memos he had received in 2016 on the background to the issue of cervical screening audit findings which in many cases were not passed on to the women concerned.One of the memos released revealed that the HSE was concerned about a risk that communicating inidual audit findings to doctors could result in patients going to the media with stories that the cervical screening process did not diagnose their cancer.Attorney General Séamus Woulfe gave an update to Cabinet on Friday morning on whether the current legal cases in relation to the women can be settled. There are currently 10 outstanding legal cases against the State over false negative smear test results. These are separate to the case of Vicky Phelan, who settled her High Court case with a laboratory in the United States for €2.5 million last month. The case was settled without admission of liability.It is understood the State will now enter a mediation process with the women to settle the outstanding claims as soon as possible.The Cabinet also discussed the resignation of director general of the HSE Mr O’Brien. Mr O’Brien will stand aside from his position by close of business on Friday.He made the decision after the release of the three memos from March and July 2016 showing the HSE was aware of a planned media strategy to respond to patients contacting media outlets to say screening did not diagnose their cancer after they received the results of the audit.Mr Harris asked the Cabinet meeting to appoint John Connaghan, who is currently the HSE’s deputy director general, to replace Mr O’Brien.The Cabinet meeting was due to be held in Monaghan but was relocated to Dublin in response to the ongoing controversy.Mr Harris, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe held a meeting late Thursday afternoon to discuss the financial measures and agreement was reached.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3491757.1526041787!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tweet from tony o brien criticised by politicians","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony O’Brien is to stand aside from his position on Friday after weeks of controversy over the CervicalCheck programme. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe A tweet from the director general of the Health Service Executive Tony O’Brien has been strongly criticised by politicians.Mr O’Brien is to stand aside from his position on Friday after weeks of controversy over the CervicalCheck programme.On Friday morning, he tweeted: “When I appear in public - say at a Committee I conduct myself against a simple standard. Would I be happy for my children or my mother to see how I behave? I sometimes look across the room and hope their children will never see and hear how they behave.”This appears to be a reference to his appearance before the Oireachtas Public Accounts committee on Thursday morning, where he faced intense questioning from members.However, Mr MacSharry insisted this was not about Mr O’Brien claiming the director general has failed to realise that. “The taxpayer pays my wages. They also pay Mr O’Brien’s. They have a right to criticise, question us and scrutinise the decisions we make. Mr O’Brien does not seem to get that this is about the women involved and not him.”Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane, who is a member of the committee, rejected the criticism of Mr O’Brien.He said members of the Pac “ask the hard questions without fear or favour” and will continue to do so.The party’s health spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly said she did not believe it was a mature thing for Mr O’Brien to have tweeted.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm.The core aspects of the wedding, including the church service, associated music, flowers, decorations and reception, will be paid for by the Royal Family, with Ms Markle’s parents both set to attend.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesFormer Suits star Ms Markle told last year how she could not wait to say yes to the prince when Harry got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, the prince revealed in a television interview: It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, Windsor. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Royal sources said the guest list will be restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, and was taken both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small, and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.As well a dress code, the Royal guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day. The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Read more about who they are here.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayOther guests will include members of Ms Markle\u0027s family - her mother Doria Radlan and father Thomas Markle Snr - and of course many members of the royal family.Tennis star Serena Williams and Ms Markle\u0027s former Suits co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Patrick J Adams and Wendell Pierce could also be on the list.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be seen as part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be making their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999.  The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. They will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.Harry also has to decide whether to wear a wedding ring. William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a “special place” during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.After the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will then undertake a two mile tour of Windsor greeting well-wishers. They will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Scant details have emerged about the receptions so far, but we do know that the couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake.Kensington Palace said Ms Ptak, owner of the Violet Bakery in Hackney, will create a cake for the Royal wedding incorporating the bright flavours of spring. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, is expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared.Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers plan to extend licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on the nights of Friday 18 and Saturday 19 May - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.

The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding schedule and timings for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big dayHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding on TV next weekPolice respond to reports of shootings at two different schools in Palmdale, CaliforniaBritish tourists \u0026#39kidnapped\u0026#39 at Virunga wildlife park in Democratic Republic of CongoWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Police hunt suspected serial sex attacker after 13 attacks on London streetsFrench family narrowly escape cheetahs after getting out of car to take pictures in safari parkPatrick Melrose, first-look review: Benedict Cumberbatch is magnificent in this harrowing dramaEvacuations in Indonesia as one of world\u0026#39s most active volcanoes eruptsEurope isn\u0026#39t US \u0026#39vassal\u0026#39 and should push back harder against Donald Trump over Iran, says FranceRoyal wedding procession route 2018 - map and timetable to help you navigate WindsorScott Hutchison wrote song about suicide as \u0026#39devastated\u0026#39 family confirm his death and depression battleRemains of ancient Roman horse found at Pompeii in dig started by tomb raidersHow popular is Donald Trump?

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) said in April that it would fine the lender’s boss for breaching conduct rules when he tried to identify a whistleblower. On Friday, the watchdogs confirmed the amount and also said they had imposed special requirements regarding whistleblowing systems and controls at Barclays. Mr Staley tried to find out who wrote two anonymous letters, which were sent to the board and a senior executive in June 2016. The letters, considered to be whistleblowing, raised concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by Barclays earlier that year.Mark Steward, FCA executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: “Given the crucial role of the chief executive, the standard of due skill, care and diligence is more demanding than for other employees.“Mr Staley breached the standard of care required and expected of a chief executive in a way that risked undermining confidence in Barclays’ whistleblowing procedures. Chief executives must act with a high degree of care and prudence at all times. Mr Steward added: “Whistleblowers play a vital role in exposing poor practice and misconduct in the financial services sector. It is critical that iniduals are able to speak up anonymously and without fear of retaliation if they want to raise concerns.”The PRA’s chief executive Sam Woods said: “Protection for whistleblowers is an essential part of keeping the financial system safe and sound. Mr Staley’s behaviour fell below the standard we require, resulting in today’s fine and public censure. In addition, Barclays is now subject to special requirements to report to the PRA and FCA how it handles its whistleblowing cases in the coming years.”Barclays: Can whistleblowers be confident after FCA warns CEO Staley?Barclays boss Jes Staley to be fined over whistleblower scandalGovernment lambasted for trumpeting prosecution of whistleblowerNicky Morgan, MP, who chairs the Treasury committee, said the committee would ask the FCA why it believes the fines handed down were appropriate, and what the implications are for the senior managers regime - a set of rules introduced in 2016 aimed at increasing the personal accountability of senior staff in financial services firms. “As the FCA’s decision notice states, a CEO should set an example to the firm’s employees. Clearly Mr Staley has failed in this regard,” Ms Morgan added. The Barclays board said it had reduced the value of Mr Staley’s “variable compensation” - meaning his annual bonus - by £500,000 following the regulators’ decision. Mr Staley said: I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologised for mistakes which I made. I accept the conclusions of the board, the FCA, and the PRA, following their respective investigations, and the sanctions which they have each applied.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The cost of the wedding itself – the food, the Ralph \u0026amp Russo Couture dress etc – will be picked by the Royal Family.But the security costs have been estimated at more than £20m. And that will be borne by the public purse.Yet the wedding might also attract additional tourists from abroad, whose expenditure will help defray some of those public costs.Some have even claimed that sales of memorabilia will boost the overall economy.Which leaves us with the perennial questions: How much money do we spend on the British monarchy? How much of an asset is it to the economy? Is the Royal Family really “worth it”?How much does the Royal Family cost the taxpayer?Direct funding to meet the monarchy’s official expenditure is now through something called the “Sovereign Grant”.This replaced the old Civil List and grants-in-aid from government departments in 2012 and is supposed to be reviewed every five years.In 2016-17 the Sovereign Grant was £42.8m, rising to £76m in 2017-18, with the increase difference earmarked for refurbishing Buckingham Palace.Royalists often point out that these costs represent only around £1 a year to every person in the UK.However, this does not include the security costs of looking after the family.One republican pressure group has estimated that these add up to £100m a year and help push the actual annual public cost of the monarchy closer to £350m.So the royals spend that money how they want?No, that’s the funding of their official duties – opening buildings, chairing charities, hosting garden parties, travelling the country and abroad etc.The Queen, Prince Charles and other members of the Royal Family have private incomes too from their private landed estates and financial assets.A sum of money called “The Privy Purse” goes to the Queen as revenue from a landed estate called the Duchy of Lancaster. This was £19.1m in 2016-17.Do the royals pay tax?The Queen has voluntarily paid income and capital gains tax since 1992 on her private income and the revenues not used to finance her official work.Prince Charles has also voluntarily paid income tax on his income from another landed estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, since 1993.In 2016-17 that estate yielded him revenue of £22.5m, on which he paid tax of £4.76m.But the situation is complicated.The majority of Prince Charles’ official duties are financed from the Duchy’s income. This income also covers the costs of the official duties of Camilla, William and Kate and Harry.All this expenditure offsets Charles’ tax liability. And all the “working royals” in Charles’ direct family also get some revenues from the Sovereign Grant too.Meanwhile, some of the Queen’s Privy Purse is also used to fund her official duties, which means she doesn’t pay tax on that element of her income.And what financial benefits do the royals bring?VisitBritain reckons that tourism linked to royal residences such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle adds up to 2.7 million visitors a year.And a consultancy called Brand Finance estimated in 2017 that the monarchy’s annual contribution to the UK economy to be around £1.8bn a year, drawing in an additional £550m of tourism revenues a year, and an increase in trade, from the Royal Family acting as ambassadors, supposedly worth £150m a year.That might sound impressive – and it’s certainly more than the higher estimates of the Royal Family’s costs to the public purse – but it’s important to put those numbers in context.Overseas visitors are estimated to have spent £22.5bn in the UK in 2016. And total UK exports summed to £543bn. Viewed from that perspective, the additional royal-related revenues start to look somewhat trivial.Moreover, we should treat even estimates of economic activity linked to the royals with a large dash of scepticism.The only way to reach these numbers is to estimate the counterfactual – what would have happened to UK tourism or trade if the Royal Family didn’t exist? Or if the official Royal Family was significantly smaller and less expensive to run?That’s not easily done. Would foreigners really be less likely to visit the UK’s historic palaces if they were no longer lived in, from time to time, by the Queen, or Prince Charles? Would the monarchy be less of a tourist draw if the likes of lesser working royals such as Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent were no longer funded by the Sovereign Grant?The economic boost from visits and festivities related to royal celebrations should certainly be treated with caution given these can displace economic activity as well as create it.This seems to have happened around Prince William’s wedding in 2011, when many UK residents appear to have left the country. Royalists might make the historic argument that the monarchy brings political stability to the UK, which has a high value to the economy. But, again, this is difficult to put a price on. Especially when the appropriate counterfactual is not anarchy, but a stable republic like France or Germany.In the end, the question of whether the Royal Family is worth it, or not, is probably less a financial question than a political, moral and aesthetic one.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The rate is significantly higher than on many unsecured personal loans available from high street banks.“As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said.“In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Half of millennials would give up right to vote to clear student loansHow to use a student loan to build a £4m travel business “Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The comments came as the Treasury Committee published the government’s response to its highly critical report on the current student loans system.The government said: “RPI has always been used for calculating interest on student loans, providing consistency over time.”It added: “The flaws in the RPI measure of inflation are well understood, and the Office for National Statistics have delivered a substantial programme of work to improve the way they measure inflation over the last two years.“The review of post-18 education and funding will look at how students and graduates contribute to the cost of their studies, including the level, terms and duration of their contribution.“It is now for the independent panel to consider the issues raised within the terms of reference in their report to government. The government cannot prejudge the findings of the panel or outcomes of the review.”A study last year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that three-quarters of students will never clear their loans and that graduates from low-income families finish their studies with the highest debt of more than £57,000 on average.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

The rate is significantly higher than on many unsecured personal loans available from high street banks.“As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said.“In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Half of millennials would give up right to vote to clear student loansHow to use a student loan to build a £4m travel business “Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The comments came as the Treasury Committee published the government’s response to its highly critical report on the current student loans system.The government said: “RPI has always been used for calculating interest on student loans, providing consistency over time.”It added: “The flaws in the RPI measure of inflation are well understood, and the Office for National Statistics have delivered a substantial programme of work to improve the way they measure inflation over the last two years.“The review of post-18 education and funding will look at how students and graduates contribute to the cost of their studies, including the level, terms and duration of their contribution.“It is now for the independent panel to consider the issues raised within the terms of reference in their report to government. The government cannot prejudge the findings of the panel or outcomes of the review.”A study last year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that three-quarters of students will never clear their loans and that graduates from low-income families finish their studies with the highest debt of more than £57,000 on average.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She has made some positive noises, and so far there has been restraint about appointing new peers.“But until there is a commitment to an overall cap on the size of the House there is a limit to what we can do.House of Lords votes out prospect of UK leaving EU with ‘no deal’“Once we have a number we can make real proactive efforts to persuade people they should go. There has been some proactive work going on, but we could write to all peers who do not attend often and suggest it is time for them to leave.”Decades of attempts to reform the Lords have failed for political reasons, with a clear chance missed in 2012 due to squabbling between Liberal Democrats and Tory MPs.May can reverse most of the Lords defeats – except on a customs unionLord speaker confirms Trump could speak in parliament despite banThe House of Lords helps to uphold our democracyLords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banMay vows to overturn Lords plan which could stop BrexitMay will take a risk if she overturns the Lords’ decision on BrexitAs a result, the Lord Speaker’s Committee spent a year to October 2017 forming a plan to at least reduce the chamber’s size without the need to pass new laws – the idea being it would be easier for any PM to push through.The committee published a 40-page report recommending slashing the number of peers to 600 in a decade, limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in size.  But in February, Ms May said they needed “further careful thought” and instead highlighted her restraint in appointing new peers since arriving in Downing St, though she also announced a handful of new Tory lords. Overall, numbers on Ms May’s watch have fallen from 812 to 792.At the time the PM’s response was welcomed as positive, but there are concerns in parliament that more needs to be done to drive the process forward.Lords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banA Downing Street source said the government is “working through” the reform plans. The Independent understands the focus will be on restraint in appointing new peers rather than a cap, however.Senior sources in the Lords also suggested that removing peers proportionately in order to maintain the overall political balance of the house could help persuade peers they would not be disadvantaging their party by leaving.Another idea to reduce members coming in, could be to introduce a new kind of peerage that does not involve membership of the house.The source said:  “Someone like Sir James Dyson could become Lord Dyson – but you don’t want him working in the Lords, you want him developing new technology and running business. That kind of peerage could have very wide appeal.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesDominick Chilcott, right, British ambassador in Turkey, hands over a letter of apology from the UK government to Libyan dissident Abdel Hakim Belhaj,  at the British Consulate, in Istanbul.

The per diem arrangements we have at the moment are not satisfactory.“They are unfair on people who don’t have homes in London. The possibility of salaries could be on the agenda if we can show the costs are coming down.”There have been new calls to abolish the Lords following stiff opposition peers have given to Ms May’s Brexit plans.The upper chamber inflicted 13 defeats on the government during the EU Withdrawal Bill’s passage through the upper chamber, including plans to keep the UK in the customs union and single market.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is not what the public voted for.Tory MP Heidi Allen signalled her support for the Lords amendments - and warned that the Commons would reject any no deal scenario.The passage of the Great Repeal Bill was always going to be turbulent, but the Lords are merely reflecting what the majority of MPs believe - that Parliament must have a say in whether the deal is good enough, and no deal never will be, she said.Best for Britain, the pro-EU campaign, have dismissed Liam Fox\u0027s remarks earlier today about the House of Lords.\u0026nbspEloise Todd, the chief executive, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLiam Fox is throwing his toys out of the pram like a petulant child. Fox just looks silly threatening the Lords every time they defeat the Government.\u0026nbspThe London Evening Standard has a report suggesting Theresa May personally vetoed pleas in the Cabinet for visas for NHS doctors.Two polls have been released on Westminster voting intention in the last 24 hours -\u0026nbspgiving Theresa May\u0027s Conservatives a 5-point and 3-point lead over Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Labour. Both were conducted before Amber Rudd\u0027s resignation, but during the height of the Windrush scandal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Cabinet expressed its strong disappointment at the Lords defeats during its weekly meeting, Downing Street said.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said the defeats risked tying the Government\u0027s hands behind its back in negotiations with Brussels.Theresa May promised that when the Bill returned to the House of Commons the Government would be robust and it was vital to ensure that the legislation is able to deliver the smooth Brexit which is in the interests of everybody in the UK.More here from the Press Association on Downing Street\u0027s response to the Lord\u0027s vote on Monday evening.\u0026nbspThe Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman would not be drawn on the approach to inidual amendments but said the Government believed the Bill had left the House of Commons in a state which will deliver what the British public voted for.He said: We wish for the Bill to go through in the same form that it left the House of Commons, in a way that does deliver on that smooth Brexit.Asked if the Prime Minister was confident that the changes imposed by the Lords could be reversed, the spokesman said: What we believe is that the country wants us to deliver on smooth Brexit, which the public voted for.That is in the interests of the Houses of Parliament to allow us to deliver that.Asked about Liam Fox\u0027s comments on the House of Lords, the spokesman said: There is a role for it to play in providing scrutiny, but the British public have voted to leave the European Union and Parliament needs to get on and deliver that.Load morePlease allow a moment for the live blog to load.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But Mr Mahathir said he had won a clear mandate to form a new government and brushed aside any doubts that he would be the one to take the country forward.There is an urgency here, we need to form the government now, today, Mr Mahathir told a news conference, where he insisted that he would be sworn in as prime minister later on Thursday.Malaysia opposition coalition leader Mahathir Mohamad: \u0027swearing in of Prime Minister will occur within a day\u0027An official from the opposition alliance, known as the Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope), said Mr Mahathir had been granted a meeting with the king at 5pm local time.Pakatan Harapan comfortably beat Mr Najib\u0027s Barisan Nasional (National Front) coalition, and official results showed it took 113 seats - one more than the number required for a majority in the 222-member parliament.But doubts remained over Mr Mahathir\u0027s status, Malaysian media reported, as Pakatan Harapan was not formally registered as a coalition prior to the vote.Asked why he had not yet been sworn in on Thursday afternoon, Mr Mahathir said he got up late after the vote count went long into the night. Mr Mahathir led Malaysia for 22 years until 2003, but returned from political retirement to take charge of the opposition, with Mr Najib embroiled in a corruption scandal and facing growing unpopularity towards a controversial new sales tax.Looking downcast as he took to the stage to address the media alongside other senior National Front politicians, Mr Najib said: The National Front will respect whatever decision is made by the king. I urge all Malaysians to be calm and to trust the king\u0027s wisdom to make the best choice.Supporters of the incoming government took to the streets of Kuala Lumpur to celebrate their unexpected victory.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPolice forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no suggestion Oaksure have behaved in any improper way.In a statement to The Sun the government has denounced the schemes and revealed it will be issuing fresh advice on the practice.Labour MP Clive Betts, chair of Parliaments Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, said: When you are desperate for housing, like many are in London, people can easily walk into this and find they have no security or rights at all.”A source close to the company told how the industry boomed during the financial crash with unregulated firms seeing the schemes as a licence to print money.The insider added: Its unregulated so anyone can start a  business and draw up a licence agreement to occupy properties.“Askins was a rogue in that he had no intention of honouring the money he owed to people – suppliers, electricians, plumbers, they were small fry compared to s.“They all thought the deposits were safe but because it’s unregulated they were not protected and he spent s’ bond money basically.”But many renters have complained of leaking roofs, poor conditions and ruthless companies taking advantage of their financial plight.One told a reporter how rats had infested their property with water leaking in from the roof but that  firm had failed to tackle the issue.Councils across London and private landlords are allowing the companies to rent out an increasing number of empty buildings with up to 7,000 property s - almost double the figure of three years ago.We found companies currently advertising to live in derelict school buildings, youth centres and empty flats for up to £750-a-month with deposits as high as £900 and admin charges of more than £150.And with London rental prices having increased by more than 60 per cent in some areas over the last decade - meaning a similar one-bedroom space could be at least double  price - it is thought ship trend will continue to grow.But experts have warned s are vulnerable as they do not have adequate protections including for deposits which can be over £1,000 and average around £550, according to a recent report.Firms can install temporary showers and kitchens to re-classify buildings as domestic use - slashing business rates.But some s have told how companies do not provide heating - instead requiring renters to buy electric heaters and even fire safety equipment while still paying utility bills on top.And the cost of occupying abandoned buildings as s has risen sharply in the more than ten years the schemes have been operating.Renters used to pay a nominal fee of £100-200 per month to occupy a building and help secure it but now rents average just under £500 across London.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said they do not endorse property ship as people can be left to live in poor conditions and pledged to issue new advice.Askins failed to respond to the Sun Online and is currently the director of the re-named firm New Century s with a postal address in Central London.Southwark Council, whose logo appears on the firms New Century s website, said they had cut all ties and were seeking to have their branding removed after being alerted by The Sun.A spokeswoman for Greenwich Council said they had no option but to write-off the £71,644 owed by Newbould when the company went into liquidation."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000394900236.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"global britain customs union sun says","story":"As MPs return to Parliament this week, Tory rebels think they can twist the Prime Minister’s arm and force her into membership of the customs union, or at least an imitation of it.They’re all over the airwaves slamming their free-trading colleagues as “hard Brexit” ideologues.But those pushing for us to strike out on our own are far from rabid extremists.

Shame on them.More MPs backed away from Tom Watson’s sinister “Section 40” bid to force papers into the death grip of Max Mosley’s Press-hating Impress crew.Watson’s sole aim was revenge against papers critical of Labour.

Nor will his orgy-loving benefactor Mosley, nor Miliband, nor Hacked Off Hugh nor their weird, obsessive acolytes.The Tories will have to defend Press freedom again.

They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

brussels britain hostage brexit irish border","story":"The leading Brexiteer is reportedly worried that the EU will use the issue to keep us permanently tied to its laws.Mr Gove told allies Brussels was exploiting the row over the border as a Trojan horse to water down Brexit, the Daily  reported.Theresa May has previously signed up to a controversial backstop plan intended to keep the Irish border open.The proposal - which will take effect only if there is no trade deal - would see Northern Ireland keep the same trade rules as the Republic.Mr Gove, the Environment Secretary, wants the PM to refuse to ratify the backstop formally, fearing that it would keep the UK in Europes customs union and single market.Speaking at a private dinner, he reportedly said the plan was a Trojan horse and warned the EU wants to hold us hostage.He added that if we accept the backstop, We wont have all the negotiating cards we would want.A spokesman for Mr Gove declined to comment.Both Britain and the EU have vowed to forge a bespoke solution to the Irish border question.But last December, they agreed that the backstop would take effect if they failed to strike a deal.The plan would force Northern Ireland to adhere to the laws of the customs union and the single market, so that goods can flow freely across the border.But that would either create a hard border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain - or force the whole UK to adopt EU rules.THE question of the Irish border has become one of the most furious rows of the Brexit process.At the moment, there are no controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic, because EU rules apply on both sides of the border.That means goods can flow across without restrictions, and businesses can operate in both countries easily.All sides - Britain, the Republic of Ireland and the EU - agree that the border should remain open after Brexit.But they havent been able to agree on how to do it.Theresa May has ruled out keeping the whole UK in Europes customs union, because it would stop us striking trade deals around the world.Another option - for Northern Ireland to adopt customs union rules while the rest of the UK diverges - has also been shot down.That plan would effectively create a border in the Irish Sea, which is unacceptable to Mrs Mays DUP allies.The Government is hoping to introduce new technology which automatically checks goods as they cross the border, eliminating the need for physical infrastructure.Another plan, hated by Brexiteers, would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods entering the UK.But neither proposal has been approved by the EU ahead of a crunch summit next month."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000405200566.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cotton bud removed ear years after stuck","story":"The man went to a clinic in Leicestershire complaining of pain and limited hearing in his right ear.He told doctors at the Hear Clinic he had got a cotton bud stuck in his ear two years ago but he believed it had fallen out on its own.But, after recently going swimming, the water that entered the man’s ear caused the cotton bud to swell and cause him pain.The wad of cotton was removed by Neel Raithatha at the clinic on June 6Neel said: “The client reported muffled hearing in the right ear.“Fortunately, the eardrum was healthy and intact and it took around a minute to remove.“It was a delicate procedure given the cotton bud was pushed right up against the eardrum.“I had to ensure I did not exert any force whilst removing as I could have easily have perforated the eardrum in doing so.”Experts have previously warned against using cotton buds to clean your ears.Inserting cotton buds in your ear could push wax even further into the ear canal and even damage your eardrum, according to draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).Instead, they suggest ear irrigation should be used to help those who are experiencing hearing problems due to wax build-up.This involves an electronic machine safely pumping water into the ear to remove wax under the guidance of a GP.This mans case is not the first time Neel, who calls himself the wax whisperer, has had to remove an unusual object from a patient’s ear.“I have previously removed a pen cap and earring from the ear,” he added.Earwax, also called cerumen, is a naturally occurring substance that protects the skin of the ear canal, helps keep it clean and protects against bacteria.It can build-up over time but usually excess earwax falls out on its own.But if it doesnt, you should visit your GP or pharmacist."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004030209981.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk faces weekend weather washout with showers set to

when given ginger, compared to a placebo treatment.And those taking sick days from school was 28 per cent lower in kids given the spice.Dr Roberto Berni Canani, associate professor of paediatrics from the University of Napoli in Italy said the research could potentially save lives worldwide.Acute gastroenteritis is still one of the biggest causes of death in children living in developing countries, he told the The Independent.And dehydration is its most dangerous complication.Reducing the amount a person vomits when they are unwell can prevent dehydration.We anticipate that the results will have a great impact on future clinical practice and the advice given to parents in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis and could potentially save lives across Europe and the globe, Dr Canani added.In the clinical trial 140 children were given ginger or a placebo.Ginger has long been used as a natural remedy for stomach upset.Studies have found the spice has anti-inflammatory properties, which can also be used to help ease swelling in the body.Gastroenteritis is a very common condition that causes diarrhoea and vomiting.Its usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug.The illness affects people of all ages but is most common in children.Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week.You can normally look after yourself or your child at home

experience symptoms of dehydration, notice blood in your poo or cant keep any fluids down you should speak to a GP.Dr Canani and his team plan to look at whether ginger can be effective in children

missing person on YouTube.The popular website features dozens of clips dedicated to the baffling story  - which have been viewed tens of millions of times in total.The videos are broadcast in many languages proving the mystery has gripped people across the globe.Some believe he may have collapsed and died or committed suicide while others say he has gone into hiding. There are even claims he was snatched by people traffickers for his organs.The only thing that is certain is that he has not been seen since his final moments were caught on the airports security cameras. Worrying CCTV footage showed the German holidaymaker breaking into a sprint as if trying to run away from someone.Minutes earlier he was seen casually strolling through the terminal in a bright yellow T-shirt pulling along his luggage seemingly without a care in the world.He can then be seen heading away from the terminal before leaping a barrier and dashing into the trees beyond.What happened next to is a total mystery but it has since been revealed Lars was convinced he was being followed, reports the Mirror.Bulgarian cops later found his rucksack and suitcase containing his wallet, passport and mobile phone. The mystery has fascinated the world and clips from the terminal have gone viral.Many have since described Lars as the most famous famous missing person on YouTube.The 28-year-old had flown with friends from their home in Itzehoe, northern Germany, to the notorious Bulgarian seaside resort of Golden Sands.Things were going fine until Lars was said to have been hurt after becoming embroiled in a late night fight.The Werder Breman fan had reportedly brawled with a group of rival Bayern Munich followers after becoming separated from his pals.Lars was punched in the head leaving him with a perforated ear drum and possible concussion - which meant he was unable to fly back home with his pals and checked into an airport hotel.Friend Paul Rohmann would later tell German television Lars was relaxed and in a good mood when they left him.However, Lars then made a phone call to his mum telling her to cancel his bank cards and suggested he was being followed by people trying to kill him.Sandra Mittank told German TV: I thought, god, my son is in danger. I could hear his heart pounding over the phone. He said people were trying to rob him or kill him.Lars needed the all-clear to fly from an airport doctor, who reportedly described him as nervous and erratic.Dr Kosta Kostov has been quoted saying Lars began to tremble when a builder entered the room and cried: I dont want to die here. I have to get out of here.At this point Lars reportedly leapt to his feet and dashed towards the airport exit.Footage shows him sprinting as fast as he can out of the terminal passing the boarding gates, check-in desks and baggage drop zones.Police have since turned up no concrete leads and a private investigator hired by his family failed to find any trace of Lars.It has never been established what triggered his paranoia - drugs, a reaction to his medication for his eardrum, or a head injury from the fight.Theories circulate online about what became of Lars in Bulgaria - a country with high levels of human trafficking and organised crime.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The world\u0026#8217s worst Ebola outbreak took the lives of 11,000 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in 2014 after the virus spread from a young boy living in a village in rural Guinea. Poorly equipped and understaffed medical workers turned down infected patients and when the disease spread to the densely populated Liberian capital of Monrovia a health crisis turned into a catastrophe.In early 2016, the WHO said the outbreak had been contained and eliminated but 17,000 survivors were left traumatised and fearful of the future.Over the past few days, the DRC\u0026#8217s near-neighbours like Nigeria have taken steps to prevent the spread of the virus by introducing checks and health screening at its airports.Meanwhile, the Trump administration signalled its disinterest when it asked for ebola-related funding cuts of US$252 million, as part of a package aimed at reigning in government spending."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-jeremy-corbyn-jeremy-corbyn-mp_4306861.jpg?20180511150947 ","title":"jeremy corbyn dismisses calls to back eea membership after brexit","story":"Speaking during a visit to Scotland on Friday, Mr Corbyn signalled he will ignore pleas from backbench MPs to support EEA membership - classed by many as \"soft Brexit\".He said: \"We\u0027ve made it very clear our whole strategy is that we recognise the result of the referendum, that we obtain a tariff-free trade relationship with Europe and that we develop a customs union to go alongside that.\"But, the EEA of itself, does not offer that because the EEA would not offer us any power to negotiate, we would merely be rule-takers not rule-makers in that.\"So, we would want a comprehensive relationship with the EU that developed that trading relationship.\"However, Mr Corbyn suggested Labour will support peers\u0027 amendments on environmental standards, food safety and workers\u0027 rights as he paid tribute to \"those that have managed to amend the EU Withdrawal Bill in such a positive way in so many cases\".Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a supporter of the People\u0027s Vote campaign, said: \"To retain the economic benefits of the EU if we Brexit we must continue to participate in the EEA as the TUC and others advocate, and - given all the new facts arising - there should be a People\u0027s Vote on the Brexit deal.\"MPs alone should not determine the destinies of 65 million people on such a big issue.\"Following talks with Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard on Friday, Mr Corbyn also backed Scottish Labour\u0027s decision not to consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill in the Scottish Parliament.He said: \"I\u0027m very happy the Scottish Labour Party will be voting against the legislative consent proposal this week.\"Because, quite clearly, there is a power grab going on by Whitehall on the EU Withdrawal Bill.\"What they\u0027re doing is taking powers from Brussels that then ought to go to Scotland, Wales and English regions and instead hoarding them in Whitehall.\"That is unacceptable to us and we have made that very, very clear.\"Despite their initial opposition to the EU Withdrawal Bill, the Labour-led Welsh Government will now back the legislation."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-north-korea-restaurant_4306546.jpg?20180511105659 ","title":"north korean defectors may have been tricked","story":"At the time of their defection in 2016, South Korea had said it was satisfied that the women had escaped from the North voluntarily.But North Korea had accused the South of \"hideous abduction\" and demanded the group be returned.South Korea\u0027s Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun said: \"New claims have been made on how the North Korean workers escaped and arrived in South Korea and whether they were acting on their free will.He did not say whether the women might be returned to North Korea if it is confirmed they were in the South against their will.But he admitted the South had never interviewed them after their arrival in 2016.An official for South Korea\u0027s spy agency did not confirm or deny the JTBC report.According to the South Korea government, more than 30,000 people have fled from the North to the South since the end of the Korean War in 1953.

It came after Grenfell families blasted the Prime Minister in Parliament after she failed to resolve the key split over the public inquiry. Grieving relatives claimed the Prime Minister worsened their pain and suffering after a private meeting about the fire that killed 71 people last June. In a letter to chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick, Mrs May said she would add two additional members to the panel to ensure the panel has “the necessary breadth of skills and diversity of expertise”. She wrote: I hope this decision will provide reassurance to victims and survivors of the fire, the local community and members of Grenfell United, who have been clear with me and the Minister for Grenfell Victims, Nick Hurd, that you are the right person to lead this Inquiry but who also believe that, in Phase 2, it would be beneficial to have additional panel members recognising the scale and breadth of issues to be considered. The new members will sit alongside Sir Martin for phase two of the inquiry. Adel Chaoui, who lost four relatives in the fire is a member of Grenfell United and led a 150,000 signature petition for the group, along with Karim Mussilhy who lost his uncle and Sandra Ruiz who lost her niece.  Speaking on behalf of Grenfell United Adel said: “We should not have had to campaign for it, but relieved to finally have granted a panel for the Inquiry. This is a huge step for all of us who are desperate to make sure the Inquiry delivers truth and justice for the loved ones we lost in the fire \u0026amp those that survived. In the letter, Mrs May wrote: For my part, you will recall that I wrote to you on 21 December 2017 confirming that I did not consider it necessary to appoint additional panel members to the Inquiry panel at that time.  You are also aware that the Inquiries Act 2005 affords me the power to appoint panel members at any time during the Inquiry and I have iterated my intention to keep the matter under review. “To ensure the inquiry panel itself also has the necessary breadth of skills and diversity of expertise relevant to the broad range of issues to be considered in Phase 2, and to best serve the increasing scale and complexity of the work going forwards, I have decided to appoint an additional two panel members to support your chairmanship for Phase 2 of the Inquiry’s work. Sir Martin replied to the Prime Minister\u0027s letter, saying he looked forward to receiving the names of the people Mrs May decided to appoint to the panel. Tottenham MP David Lammy said:One step closer to justice. Testament to the courage, strength and dignity of the Grenfell families, survivors and wider community.  I’m proud to stand with you. This campaign should not have been needed but it was But Mrs May risked sparking fresh anger by refusing to change the first stage of the inquiry. The new panel members will not be added to the inquiry for Phase 1 - which includes examining the existing fire safety measures at Grenfell Tower. They will only be added for Phase 2, which will look at the wider responsibilities of authorities like Kensington and Chelsea Council. By that time, the date of which is yet to be agreed, chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick will have already written an interim report on the disaster. Phase 1 opens on June 4 after commemorative hearings for the victims. Apart from looking at Grenfell’s existing fire safety, Phase 1 will mainly deal with the chain of events on the fatal night last year. Phase 2 will then examine a long list of remaining issues such as communication with residents, governance and management, inspections and previous inquiries. Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed a painting of the tower after the fire, featuring the inscription Eyesore!! Final Straw, will be displayed in Number 10. The painting is by Damel Carayol, a 55 year old artist from North London who lost family members in the disaster. The spokesman said: “She was given the painting yesterday. This will be coming to Downing Street. In the normal way when we receive artwork we will consider where it best fits.” “My understanding is there’s a process when we get artwork and we need to consider where it fits within the house. There’s a great deal of artwork in No10.” But asked specifically if it would be displayed in Number 10, he said: “Yes, that’s my understanding.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brits want amazing royal roadster","story":"NewsBrits want this amazing ‘Royal Roadster’ hybrid for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s to drive off in after weddingThe imaginary cool white sports car merges the best of British and American motoring – an Aston Martin DB11 and the iconic Ford Mustang\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAstrid Hall16:13, 11 MAY 2018Updated16:15, 11 MAY 2018NewsThe car’s name, Royal Roadster, was a clear winner, with almost 60 per cent of the vote, beating off other potential suggestions including the ‘Monarch’s Motor’ and ‘Prince’s Pit Stop’\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrits believe this should be the vehicle newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will drive off into the sunset in following their wedding. The imaginary cool white sports car - dubbed the \u0027Royal Roadster\u0027 - merges the best of British and American motoring – an Aston Martin DB11 and the iconic Ford Mustang. And it topped a survey of more than 2,000 adults to uncover the top choices for the wedding vehicle. It is also thought the motor will feature neutral ribbons and elegant white flowers for a simple and classy look.  The research, commissioned by webuyanycar , revealed 86 per cent of Brits believe Harry and Meghan will hop into a British car on their big day, while one in 10 imagine the motor could be a half and half American-British hybrid.  The DB11 shape forms the base of webuyanycar’s imaginary Windsor wedding car, adapted with the wheels and arches of the iconic Mustang. The eye-catching car also sports the rear end of a classic Mustang, with a Ford bumper, chrome protection bar and two side exhausts.  The final design also reflects some more distinctive details – since four in 10 of those surveyed think the happy couple’s car will feature a personalised number plate. One in 10 even hope the royal wedding coup\u0026eacute will include a special side car for Meghan’s beloved pet Beagle, Guy.  Richard Evans, head of technical services at webuyanycar , said: “Everything about Harry and Meghan’s wedding, from the bridesmaids and cake, to the invitation and entertainment, has been speculated on by the public.  “Of course, travelling in style is a key part of a wedding day, so we decided to find out what the public thought the royals would choose for their wedding car.  “The fact that Harry and Meghan are a modern couple, with classic style, has been reflected in our unique design, which has been crowned the ‘Royal Roadster’. “We do live by our name of buying any car on the market and we purchase a fine selection of wedding cars and stretch limos every year. “I doubt we will ever see one as unique as the Royal Roadster, however. “Now we just can’t wait to see how close we got to the actual car the couple choose for their big day next week.” The car’s name, Royal Roadster, was a clear winner, with almost 60 per cent of the vote, beating off other potential suggestions including the ‘Monarch’s Motor’ and ‘Prince’s Pit Stop’.  One in twenty of those polled think the car will be decorated in celebration of the two nations, donning star-spangled banners and union jacks. And after tying the knot at Windsor Castle, 80 per cent of people said Harry would be the one to open the car door for Meghan like a true gent. In true royal fashion, three in five think the car will be driven by a member of the Royal Household Staff. But nearly one quarter believe all tradition will go out the window with Prince Harry sitting behind the wheel on his big day. Following their reception, many think the couple will head back to Buckingham Palace to greet their adoring fans.

Glamourous three-year-old Afghan Hound AJ Nirvana Battle turns heads wherever he goes and has flowing locks that a model would be proud of. His owner Kevin Chan spends six to eight hours bathing his beloved pet, then piles on a number of products, including baby powder and hairspray. Marketing director Kevin, who lives in Beijing, China, has spent \u0026pound11,600 to date on grooming equipment and coughs up \u0026pound525 a month on bathing products to keep his pup\u0027s pristine floor-length mane perfectly preened.  The Hong Kong-born 29-year-old spends six to eight hours a week brushing the hairy hound and claims Battle is the most beautiful animal on the globe. Kevin said: Since the moment I decided to take Battle home, he was already the most beautiful dog in the world. He is a family member now, so I don\u0027t mind spending time and money on him. I need to bathe him regularly every seven to 10 days - it takes six to eight hours to bathe and groom him every time.  I do all the grooming myself and have spent about 100,000 CNY (\u0026pound11,600) to date on grooming equipment. I spend another 4,000 to 5,000 CNY (\u0026pound535) on the best bathing products every month. Afghan hounds were born as models and have their own unique characters. I don\u0027t style him deliberately, I just follow my heart.  I always tell people I didn\u0027t choose the dog but was chosen by him, therefore I have to try my best to give him the best treatment I can. Every day, Kevin, who adopted Battle two years and eight months ago, sprays a nutritious solution on the pooch\u0027s fur to smooth it before letting this sink in for one minute. Then he uses a bristle brush to ease out any knots in the pooch\u0027s mane - using talcum or baby powder to remove tangles. The 29-year-old has even bought a camera and taken up photography lessons so he can share the best photos of his pampered pet on social media.  Kevin said: Every day, I spray a special nutritious solution on Battle\u0027s fur and comb him. I have to brush him every day, to keep his fur from knotting together. When he was younger it would take me two hours a day to groom him, but now I only have to do this for an hour a time. The only thing, which is the hardest, is to skilfully comb him - then you can get the nicest shots. I began to film and shoot him from the first day I got him because I wanted to keep every single moment.

A community gardens project, a bread-baking initiative to help older people living in care homes and sheltered housing, and a children’s drama group are among those who will benefit this year. Up to \u0026pound3million has been awarded to 57 causes across the UK, making a massive impact on each deserving cause. It follows months of planning for the campaign, which led to a 2 week voting window to decide which which groups and organisations would finally be declared winners out of a shortlist of 95 projects across all 19 regions.  In each region, the three projects with the most public votes received grants of up to \u0026pound50,000 to help them continue their work to bring people together, build stronger communities and improve the lives of thousands of people across the country. So to show just how much you are helping incredible community groups make a difference with National Lottery funding, here’s a look at just some of this year’s The People’s Projects winners.... Learning for the Fourth Age – Baking A Difference A Leicester-based baking project pioneered by Learning for the Fourth Age (L4A) is raising the roof after receiving \u0026pound43,000 of National Lottery funding having been voted one of the regional winners of The People\u0027s Projects 2018. The Baking A Difference scheme, which started last year, uses bread baking to bring older people in care homes and sheltered \u2028housing together with local communities. “We are excited to get this funding because, although it is a simple idea, there are so many ways to explore it,” says project manager Fiona Smith. “Creative bread making sparks conversations, it keeps hands and minds busy, it offers physical activity and fun.” The money will help widen the project to other care homes and sheltered housing in Leicestershire, pay for the time and materials of a professional baker and train and mentor volunteers. “The idea is to create bonds of friendship and reduce feelings of loneliness, isolation or boredom,” adds Fiona. Shining Stars ASN Theatre School - Shining Stars Community Adventure  Theatre project Shining Stars Community Adventures is centre stage after receiving \u0026pound43,000 of National Lottery funding having been voted one of the regional winners of The People\u0027s Projects 2018.

Shining Stars ASN (Additional Support Needs) Theatre School was started by Katie Slavin for children, young people and adults with additional support needs. There are lessons in drama, musical theatre and dance, sensory drama, drama therapy, a film club and Makaton signing choir. Katie says: “Now we can travel across the country to perform and go on days out. The children and adults who come here are amazing. It makes my life so happy.” Billingham Environmental Link Programme LTD - Growing Our Community  Stockton-on-Tees can create vibrant green space for all ages after winning almost \u0026pound50,000 of National Lottery funding thanks to the members of the public who voted for them to be one of the regional winners of The People\u0027s Projects 2018.

BELP was set up in 2010 by retired policeman Kevin Pitt. Since then the programme has taken over three community centres, turning one into a not-for-profit children’s nursery and another a horticultural centre.

The recovering 96-year-old royal drove to the Royal Windsor Horse Show at Windsor Castle, the summer retreat where his grandson Prince Harry will wed Meghan Markle. Philip, appearing frail and thin, was photographed casually dressed and sat at the wheel of the 4x4 as he talked to his wife the Queen through the vehicle\u0027s open window. The former naval officer\u0027s appearance is likely to be interpreted as confirmation he has recovered enough to attend Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, wedding next week.

Planners have carefully timetabled to event to ensure preparations for Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding, which will be held at the castle\u0027s gothic St George\u0027s Chapel, will not be affected. Philip retired from public life in August last year, quipping at the time that he was no longer able to stand up much.  It had been reported that Philip was believed to have ditched his crutches following the hip operation and would watch his grandson tie the knot with the US actress on May 19. There were fears he would miss the big day due to his health. Kensington Palace said on May 4 that Harry would be supported at the ceremony by his grandmother the Queen, his dad Prince Charles and his brother Prince William, who is his best man.

Players at the University of Hull\u0027s Men\u0027s Hockey Club are reportedly asked to drink the racist pints to \u0027punish\u0027 them for racist comments.  One young man is said to have had to down a pint after telling other players: Black people always get their way f*****ng c***s. Meanwhile, a horrifying Snapchat photo showed a document apparently written by a member of the team describing slaves as great. One player at the sports club claimed that racist comments are often made, so they had to create a type of \u0027punishment\u0027 for them.   Speaking to The Tab , the player alleged that this was the way that the club was trying to combat racism among team members.  A spokesman for club said it takes any reports of inappropriate behaviour - including racism - extremely seriously. As part of the drinking game, it is claimed that players who are said to have racist tendencies are asked to drink a racist pint. This will happen on a night out or during a team social. In a screenshot sent to The Tab, the men\u0027s hockey group chat appears to show members of the team talking about the racist pints. The group chat shows a hockey player purportedly saying mid-conversation: Black people always get there way f*****ng c***s (sic). Another member says: That\u0027s by far more than one racist pint surely.  The source told the reporter that the first - nicknamed \u0027The Ape\u0027 on the chat - was punished for his racist comment with a racist pint. He said: This member gets punished a lot for his comments as he has racist tendencies when he drinks which we do not accept. He added that we as a club decided to punish the member as it occurred within our walls, and that the team does not condone racism. A Snapchat photo was also sent to the news site purportedly of a member of the hockey club trying to do a history essay.  The document was titled, How \u0027popular\u0027 was the movement to abolish the British slave trade? the Hull Daily Mail reports.  Underneath, the author had apparently written: Not very, slaves are great. Imagine being able to tell someone to cup their hands underneath your a**e while you s**t and tell them to eat it...and they have to. He had added that the best bit was that you don\u0027t even have to pay them because they\u0027re black.

The same single tube of Colgate is 898% cheaper in Tesco, costing just 80p, and it\u0027s also on sale in Boots for \u0026pound1. Critics have accused the company of cashing in on the sick by hiking up prices at the shop in Pinderfields General Hospital in Wakefield. However bosses claim it was a printing error and it should actually only cost \u0026pound2.49 - which is still a lot more expensive than it costs elsewhere. In total 89 tubes were sold at the incorrect price before staff noticed the error. Marc Leaf, 45, noticed the shocking price tag while trying to buy toothpaste for his girlfriend who is being treated at the hospital.  He said: Everything in there is totally ridiculous. A hospital is a place where people to to get better. They aren\u0027t at their best and are usually at their most vulnerable. It\u0027s the last place they should be taken advantage of, but this price tag is just totally taking the mick out of people. It\u0027s \u0026pound7.99 for a tube of toothpaste that I\u0027ve seen for a \u0026pound1 in a Home Bargains store or a pound shop. It comes despite the company promising to slash prices in hospital shops in 2015 after MPs called them out on the different price tags compared to its own high street shops. Marc said: When I was there, I looked around, and there are a lot of people knocking about who are less fortunate than others.  It\u0027s absolutely outrageous. I went to the counter and asked the assistant \u0027is this right?\u0027 and they said it was. I was gobsmacked. It\u0027s extortion. They are cashing in on sick people who can\u0027t go elsewhere. Something needs to be done about it. In the end I went for the tiny little travel size one and it was \u0026pound2.69. That\u0027s still ridiculous. WH Smith has 610 shops on the high street and 839 \u0027travel outlets\u0027 - shops in airports, railway stations, motorway service areas, hospitals and workplaces. Of these, 129 are in hospitals. A spokesman for WH Smith said: We would like to apologise to our customers for a recent pricing error in our system relating to this product. While the wrong price was effective we sold a total of 89 units. The total proceeds from these sales (\u0026pound711) will be donated to charity. The error has been rectified and changed to the correct price of \u0026pound2.49. The company said all of the products they sell in their hospital stores are the same price as in their the high street branches. The price at the hospital in Wakefield was highlighted on Twitter by a reporter at the Health Service Journal. Responding to the tweet, one person said: They\u0027ve been warned just a couple years ago for price gouging. If that isn\u0027t an accidental mistake then they need fined.  Another added: Please tell me this isn\u0027t true. Absolutely horrible to think the cost of a product vital to oral health is spiked because someone is unwell in a hospital. This should be provided on wards regardless. One wrote: I assume that buys you a check up and polish too for that money.

The growing herd of around 22 bucks are said to be “procreating like there is no tomorrow”, with councillors at County Clare, on the outskirts of Ennis, forced to come up with a way to manage the population boom, the Irish Mirror reported.  The goats have been living on the Kilrush Road for the past 20 years but have recently started to make a nuisance of themselves. Clare councillor Mary Howard said the townspeople didn’t want to see the goats put down, instead suggesting relocation of some of the herd, or castration of the males to stop the rapid breeding.  Two of the goats were recently electrocuted after wandering into an electricity sub-station. Others have been spotted jumping on cars and trampling and eating gardens while councillor Pat Daly claimed he had been told of two near-misses involving goats and motorists. In response to the town’s cry for help, councillor Johhny Flynn said the herd must be dealt with as a matter of urgency: “In the interest of animal welfare, public safety, protection of property, and to avoid a road accident that would lead to animal or human injury or death”.

Dashcam footage shows William Farmer, 18, walking down the middle of a road being closely followed by a policeman on foot and an officer driving a white 4x4. Suddenly the unnamed officer driving swerves in front of him and bashes him to the ground with a violent thud. The teen appears to initially try to cower away from the two officers, but then suddenly rolls onto his back and starts convulsing. But instead of giving him first aid, the officer that knocked him down grabs his top and yanks him onto his front and puts him in handcuffs. His family say he was suffering from a fit when he was handcuffed by police, and are calling for an urgent inquiry into what happened.  They also raised concerns about the police force\u0027s initial response to a previous video released of the incident - which didn\u0027t show as clearly what happened. Earlier this week, police claimed the incident occurred when the teenager “collided” with the police car. They have now taken action against the unnamed officer who was driving after the latest video was released. Solicitor George Newhouse, who is providing legal support for the man\u0027s family, told NITV News : “What I find particularly concerning about that image, is that as William is having a fit, instead of showing compassion and providing assistance, it appears that he\u0027s handcuffed. And that seems totally inappropriate and in fact cruel.  He’s never fitted before and the family are incredibly distressed and concerned about his situation, his physical injuries and they’re currently investigating those and we don’t know the results as yet, Mr Newhouse said. He was an Aboriginal man simply walking down the street and being followed by a police officer. There was no need to apprehend him in this violent way, and we’re totally at a loss to understand how or why this incident took place and if it wasn’t on film I’m not so sure that you’d be seeing the intense investigation that’s currently underway. Mr Newhouse said the teenager has been going back and forth between hospital and home for tests since the incident.  Western Australia police said the matter was being investigated internally by police. A spokesman said: The officer, a senior sergeant, was stood down from all operational duty pending the outcome of the investigation by the Internal Affairs Unit. Gerry Georgatos from the federal government\u0027s National Indigenous Critical Response Service said he believed the collision was deliberate. The individual was purposely knocked over by the police vehicle., he said. Then he appears in a fit like state and instead he is maltreated further, flipped around while in a fit like state and handcuffed.

The former lighting director was also spotted buying flowers for his ex-wife, Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland , during a day of errands in Los Angeles. Mr Markle bought two pretty plants at a Home Depot and dropped them off at Doria\u0027s house, but she was not at home. He left the gifts and a card in a pink envelope on the doorstep.

Dramatic video captured from the vehicle behind the family, believed to be from France, shows the big cats dashing towards the family at Beekse Bergen in the Netherlands. Seconds before the near horrifying encounter, a woman and whom appears to be a teenage boy were filmed leaving their black-coloured car to photograph cheetahs lying down in the park. A young child is also spotted outside the car just yards from the animals, while the woman appears to move a car seat from the back seat to the boot.  They eventually get their car and drive a short distance before getting out again when the big cats make their move. Visitors filming the cheetahs as they rampaged towards the family are heard uttering jesus and oh my god in disbelief as the family face being surrounded.  The boy is seen rushing back to the car before getting inside while a woman holding a small child in her arms cautiously walks back towards the vehicle. Amazingly, the family managed to safely return inside the car without incident.  Park rules state visitors must remain in their cars at all times.

Jan Zakobielski billed his operation as the world\u0027s most successful escort agency, claiming more than a thousand people applied to be escorts every day. The site, Cinderella Escorts, was controversially known for women, including Brits, selling their \u0027virginity\u0027 to the highest bidder and has been called disgusting by critics. The highest earner was an American \u0027virgin\u0027 named Giselle after an Abu Dhabi businessman paid \u0026pound2.1m to have sex with her, said Jan, who claims to be 19 but has previously been reported as 27. He claimed a British woman named Jasmin sold her virginity to a Hollywood actor for \u0026pound1.4m, and a number of others had earned seven figures.  Jan, a Romanian who lives in Dortmund, Germany, said his website had around 600 escorts and 400 virgins advertising services ranging from sex and dominatrix work to celebrity parties and marriage. He claims to have received applications from teachers, soldiers, a judge, journalists, Hollywood actresses, models and a high up German politician seeking to be escorts on the website. Cinderella Escorts was known for throwing celebrity parties around the world with escorts on hand for sex, it was claimed. Jan claims he started working on the site when he was 17, and is now planning to move to Dubai to set up a \u0027sugar daddies\u0027 site and write a book about his experiences.  He said: From my time at Cinderella Escorts, it was an experience also for me and I had never dreamed it would be that big before I started this project. As a young college student, you just think, wow $1,000 pocket money and I will have a great life. And of course, I was shocked than when I hit record rates for the escorts, celebrity women started to contact me to work with them and all the world was talking about my agency. Women could become millionaires through Cinderella Escorts or travel around the world because of their job with us. Some girls really needed money because of serious reasons and girls whose life changed completely from being poor to a having a life of luxury. He added: I gave women the freedom to do with their body whatever they want. Women were part of this trend of emancipation that now all the world talks about.  I am 19-years-old, have talked with people from all over the world, gained the trust of Hollywood stars and football players, fought against difficulties from a lot of sides and built the world\u0027s most famous escort agency. I went from a young schoolboy to a multi-millionaire. I think it is the time in my life to leave this chapter of my life behind me. I have so much more things to explore and adventure. Jan decided to launch the site while living with his parents after two friends told him they were going to work as escorts. The plan was to make a bit of money, but he had no idea it would become so successful. Jan said the top escorts initially sold sex for up to almost \u0026pound900, but as the site became more popular the biggest earners would not accept booking for anything less than \u0026pound8,700. He claimed celebrities parties were arranged with 30 top escorts, including playmates, models and actresses, at extravagant locations such as private villas or palaces.  Jan added: Then we organize a party for the top European teams from the UK, Spain and Germany. These parties are that popular that we are booked out until August 2018, every weekend. During these parties, Jan claims the escorts could expect to have sex with ten people in one night. He said: They join the stars by drinking Champagne with them in a Jacuzzi for example or having a private time with them. A girl can have about 10 clients in just one night at the sex parties. If a girl is not experienced to work with celebrities or having ten guys a night we cannot accept her for these exclusive parties. Of course, she has the possibility to work in a sex club upfront for a short period to become a professional sex worker and can handle that many clients. We can recommend her the best clubs in Europe. But next to that she has a lot of other options like being from the beginning a normal high-class escort.  There she can date submissive clients which means she get spoiled without any sexual contact or meet a guy of our members club, rich guys who are searching for marriage and special arrangements. To gain access to the site\u0027s exclusive members\u0027 club, applicants needed a net worth of almost \u0026pound9m, verified by a lawyer. This gave them access to celebrity parties as well as being able to wine-and-dine women selling their virginity before deciding if they wanted to bid. Jan claimed: A German politician who worked in the Houses of Parliament in Germany [had applied to be an escort on the website]. She never worked in Germany for Cinderella Escorts, but for some rich Arabian guys who I know personally and could guarantee she would stay discreet. She was of course older, most people think women who are politicians don\u0027t look good but she was hot. Jan explained that he is now looking for a new challenge in his careeer, adding: Cinderella Escorts is known as the most exclusive agency worldwide. There is nothing to achieve anymore. The agency has the richest and most well-known clients.

We\u0026#8217ve got a Lego room at home, it\u0026#8217s all organised so it\u0026#8217s a real passion.\u0026#8221The biggest sign of their passion is the large Lego town on display in the Butterfly Cafe on Commercial Street, which Dom and Christine opened around a year-and-a-half ago, and earlier this week they organised a \u0026#8220Brickathon\u0026#8221 as part of the Dundee Design Festival.As well as showing the Lego Movie and putting some of his own models on display, children were also challenged to build a variety of different models including a castle and a farmyard, using only a table covered in Lego and their imaginations.\u0026#8220We do these kind of challenges with our kids in the house, it just kind of calms them down,\u0026#8221 Dom said.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217ll sit and get our Lego out and say do you think you can you build a truck, and they\u0026#8217ll just sit and play.\u0026#8221Taking their sons Rocco, 7, and Tiaan, 5, to Lego Land has become an annual affair for the family, and they often compete in the family challenges.\u0026#8220It brings you together,\u0026#8221 Dom said.The Lego was one of the most popular toys in the cafe, which was set up with an ethos of creating a relaxing environment for parents to bring their children.\u0026#8220Often people will come over and start playing with their kids, and they get really into it,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Lego is quite a calming thing, you really need to concentrate when you\u0026#8217re doing it.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af401376984c-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people john and mary have enjoyed 60 years of laughter and banter","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhen John James and Mary Cunningham were aged just 16, they started a relationship that has lasted a lifetime.In 1956, Mary was a pupil at Lawside Academy, excited about the school’s Christmas dance.Unknown to her, John was also heading to the dance with a pal — and that evening would lead to a 60-year marriage.John, now 78, said: “I didn’t go to Lawside — I just decided to gate-crash the party with my pal.“Luckily, there was Mary and after that night we never looked back.”The pair courted for just under two years before getting married on May 3 1958.The wedding took place at St Paul’s Cathedral in the city.Mary, also 78, remembers the day well. She said: “It wasn’t an extravagant white wedding. We were both only 18 and we didn’t have the money for that.“The ceremony took place at 8.30am because it was the day of the students’ charity event when they would decorate floats and parade them around the city so all the streets were closing.“After the wedding ceremony, we went back to my mum and dad’s house for a small wedding breakfast before heading to the Palace Theatre and then the carnival.“On our wedding night we went home and our best man, my cousin David Cunningham, made us stovies.“It wasn’t a grand day and we definitely couldn’t afford a honeymoon but it was fantastic.“Although all the pictures are black and white, I remember John’s suit being a powder blue colour.”In the image seen here, the young girl gifting the happy couple a traditional horseshoe is Mary’s cousin June Kay, who is now 66 herself.Mary, a retired teacher, and John, a retired roofer, have two sons, Stephen and John, as well as six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.It was one of their grandchildren who inspired Mary’s gift to John for their diamond anniversary.Mary said: “My granddaughter had asked why John never wore a wedding ring and the answer was he never had one to wear!“We were lucky to have been able to buy my wedding ring but John never got one.“For my gift to him this year, I bought him a gold wedding band which he now wears.“He bought me a dozen yellow roses but was shocked at the price of 12 flowers!”During their anniversary celebrations, the couple were visited at their Broughty Ferry home by Lord Provost Ian Borthwick who presented them with a bouquet of flowers and they also received a card of congratulation from the Queen.John said: “It has been 60 good years of happiness, laughter and banter. I wouldn’t change Mary for the world.“I was a lost man going down the wrong path until I met her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/20180510_142748_edited-605x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people norrie seeking old friends from the 50s and 60s for a dundee reunion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former Dundee man is hoping to contact some old friends from the 1950s and 60s to organise a reunion.Norrie Webber, who now lives across the water in Newport-on-Tay, attended St Michael’s School in Graham Street and St Vincent’s in Pitkerro Road.He can recall finishing his secondary education at St Michael’s just as actor Brian Cox was starting his first year and remembers seeing him around the school, although they were not friends.Norrie, 74, went on to work in JF Irvine’s in Dundee and was one of the members of staff carrying out stocktaking duties when The Beatles made a detour through the shop to avoid huge crowds of fans and reach the Caird Hall during their visit to the city in 1964.Another popular haunt was Fortes Cafe in Dura Street where Norrie and his friends would meet up and enjoy the music.Anyone wishing to contact Norrie can do so by calling 07821 480595.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41275e84ab-e1525953095948-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people paramedics thanked for helping dundee baby girl","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA mum-of-two has sent a heartfelt thank you to two paramedics who came to her aid when her 10-month-old daughter stopped breathing.Catriona Grant, 29, was at home with her youngest child, Rosie, when the tot started having breathing problems just before 11am last Saturday.The Perth mum called 999 immediately, and within minutes paramedic Irena Davidova and trainee technician Valerie Fairgray arrived at her home.Catriona thanked the Scottish Ambulance Service medics who helped her through the “horrible” experience.She said: “I put in an emergency call asking for an ambulance because Rosie couldn’t breathe all of a sudden.“The paramedics arrived within minutes but thankfully she had cleared her airway on her own in that time.“The crew who arrived were so kind and I just want them to be recognised for this.“They spent about 30 minutes checking her over.”Catriona, whose daughter Isla, three, was away at the time of the incident, said she wanted to show her gratitude to Irena and Valerie – both based at Perth Ambulance Station – for their “genuine kindness”.She added: “Rosie is doing fine now. It’s very scary when your child stops breathing properly, but the paramedics were so reassuring and thorough.“They treated us with such genuine kindness and it really struck me.“I want them to know how grateful I am and what a wonderful a job they did. It was a horrible thing to experience and you start to panic.”Lewis Campbell, the Scottish Ambulance Service’s east regional director, said: “Our crews are highly trained in keeping their cool and dealing with these kinds of emergency situations.“While this may have been a routine call for them, Irena and Valerie, the two paramedics who helped Ms Grant, did a great job – we’re very proud of them and we’re grateful for Ms Grant’s thanks.“The crew arrived within minutes of the Scottish Ambulance Service receiving the emergency call and did a magnificent job.“It’s great to know Ms Grant and baby Rosie are doing well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41287f04c1-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee waterfront office blocks attracting international attention but business park snubbed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe leader of Dundee City Council has expressed his disappointment at the state of disrepair parts of the technology park have fallen into, describing some areas as an “eyesore”.John Alexander was speaking at a meeting of West End Community Council when he addressed questions from members of the public.Topics included Site 6 and the Dundee One building, as well as the empty units at the Technology Park.Mr Alexander said while there were international investors looking to occupy the new Dundee One building, next to City Quay and the Apex Hotel, the technology park was being largely overlooked.He added that companies were choosing to ignore premises on the edge of the city in preference for central locations.He said: “The conversations I’ve had seem to suggest companies aren’t looking for sites on the edge of the city.“Dundee One has received inquiries from agents in Edinburgh, Glasgow and London with an active interest in going in there.“We are receiving international attention and those international investors are looking at places such as Dundee One and the city centre — they are not looking at the technology park.“I wish they were, because some of these sites are an eyesore at the moment but we can’t make people go into these premises.”Winston Phair, a director of Bawnmeadows Ltd, which owns North Shore House in the technology park, said there had been interest in the site in the last 12 months.He said: “A planning application for a car dealership was submitted but based on the feedback the application was withdrawn.“There are still notes of interest in the site and we hope for updates on future developments within the next year.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af2bdd4a9e6e-900x564.jpg ","title":"magnificent back line delights dundee boss mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann hailed a “magnificent” defensive display from his side as they laid to rest any relegation worries with a 1-0 win at Ross County.Going into the game in Dingwall, the Dark Blues were still not mathematically assured of survival, with Partick Thistle six points behind with two games to play.In the end, Thistle’s defeat at home to Motherwell meant Dundee would be safe anyway.However, Neil and his players wanted to get the job done themselves and did so thanks to Simon Murray’s 51st-minute header.Neil said: “It’s always a horrible position to be in.“I came into the job in this sort of position last season and it wasn’t enjoyable but we did the business pretty quickly in our first three games but Tuesday night it was still rolling on.“We wanted to do it off our own back, under our own steam and win the game.“I felt Ross County were the better side in the first 20 minutes, we started getting our foot on the ball and began to play a wee bit.“I was unhappy with them at half-time with the start of the game and, indeed, at the start of the second we coughed up a chance.“However, when we play we know we are a difficult side to contain and we were always looking to hit them on the break once we got the first goal.”With their own survival at stake, the Staggies were desperate for a goal that could give them a lifeline.The Dundee defence, though, held firm.Neil added: “I thought we defended magnificently well in the second half as they threw everything at it. There’s a few dodgy ones with the ball bouncing around and maybe a suggestion of a penalty but I felt we were well worth our three points.”County were furious at referee Andrew Dallas’ decision to book Michael Gardyne for diving with five minutes to go.Co-manager Stuart Kettlewell said: “I know there is human error in football but at the end of the day these decisions are massive.“But if you get a penalty at that stage of the game who knows what happens, you have an opportunity to get level and build momentum to win the game.“We would love to know who is accountable because we just get fobbed off all the time.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5af41231a61f5.jpg ","title":"mind your own business travellers move in to car park outside closed dundee toys r us","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of travellers have moved into the car park outside Dundee’s former Toys ‘R’ Us store, just weeks after the shop closed.Two motorhomes and three caravans appeared at the Kingsway West Retail Park on Wednesday night, occupying the car park immediately outside the toy store that closed last month.The three caravans are parked directly across the store entrance, occupying disabled parking spaces.Cars have been parked alongside the motorhomes and there were also installations such as barbecue grills set up by those living there.The Tele approached those living in the caravans. Only one resident opened their door – and immediately closed it after being shown press identification.Another man swore and said “mind your own business” through a crack in his window when asked why he had parked on the site.City council officers are monitoring the situation but are yet to confirm whether they will visit.The Kingsway West Retail Park is owned by fund manager ARES, and managed by the commercial property firm GVA.Dundee City Council offers travellers a dedicated campsite on the outskirts of the city at Balmuir Wood, near Tealing.The site is six miles outside Dundee and has 20 pitches, each with its own utility unit with bathroom and shower and dedicated electricity supply.However, in the past, travellers have chosen to ignore this site and set up in areas closer to the city centre.Under current legislation, travellers can usually park on unauthorised council-owned land without issue, but may be visited by council officers to discuss their intentions.However, private landowners, such as the owners of the Kingsway West Retail Park, can call in the council or seek a court order to have travellers evicted. As a last resort, the police can also be called in.A police spokesman said: “Police Scotland can confirm it is aware of the situation and we will continue to monitor and liaise with Dundee City Council.”Dundee City Council said: “We are monitoring the situation.”The Dundee branch of Toys ‘R’ Us closed on April 24 after the company went into administration.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county wide man michael gardyne on dundee and uniteds radar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWIth survival assured on Tuesday night, Dundee boss Neil McCann’s “recruitment drive” for next season is up and running.And one possible arrival could be Ross County playmaker Michael Gardyne – though, the Dark Blues may well have competition from across the city on their hands.The Dundonian is out of contract at the end of this season and, with his roots down here, a move back might be on the cards.His history with Dundee United – where he played 37 times in season 2012/13 – however, makes Tannadice a more likely destination for the 32-year-old.That’s likely to be dependent on whether Csaba Laszlo’s men can win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs.The Dark Blues won’t comment on any possible signings but gaffer Neil has been able to get working on improving his squad for next season after the 1-0 win at Ross County saw them guaranteed a ninth-place finish.He said: “The plans we’ve been looking at over the past five or six months in terms of recruitment we can actually start to push forward with now and start a bit of a recruitment drive.“I don’t think you can ever push on it 100% until you know you’re going to be safe.“Tuesday’s win allows us to start forward thinking but there’s still business to be done.“I’m not going to disrespect Ross County by going into Saturday (against Partick) and taking the foot off the gas and go through the motions, because we have to be professional.”Partick sit two points ahead of the Staggies in 11th spot and still with the possibility of catching Hamilton and jumping to safety. That’ll take a swing of 13 goals, however.With Thistle at risk of automatic relegation if they are beaten by the Dark Blues on Saturday, Neil knows his side will have to be on their game if they are to finish the season off on a high at Dens Park.He added: “We have to look to win it and, if we do our business right, we can hold our heads high.“We want to win at home. We’ve got back-to-back wins in the split and we’re looking for three.“I charged the boys with the task of getting five wins from five games – we’ve had three out of four and we’ll look to go into Partick and make it four out of five.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/bowman-390x575.jpg ","title":"tannadice game chance for arabs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBids are now being taken for fans wanting the chance to play at Tannadice in Dundee United legend Dave Bowman’s ninth annual charity match to raise funds for skin cancer and dementia charities.The game between fans making successful bids and a team of past tangerine greats takes place on Friday week with a 6.30pm kick-off.This year the fans’ team will be turning out in a special kit in honour of United’s roots as Dundee Hibernian.“This is now the ninth year of these games taking place and there is no doubt I am getting slower,” said Bowman.“The old fire is still burning so nobody better try to beat me on the park.“Seriously, this is always a great evening and a lot of fun and every year it makes me happy that players from all ability levels take part in the game.“It is all about enjoying the game.

However, they are not mathematically safe from falling into the play-off spot which Partick Thistle currently occupy.The Dee host Thistle in the last game of the season and are currently six ahead with a better goal difference – meaning they are practically safe. However, Neil is not taking anything for granted.He added: “Clearly we’re safe from the automatic spot but there’s still work to be done. We’ve put ourselves in a really good position.“You can’t be too complacent, you can’t take anything for granted.”\t\t\t"}]
