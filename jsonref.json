Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism. Her talents played a big role in our successful launch of CBS’ first network daytime talk show, and in the series growth into an Emmy Award-winning broadcast,\u0027 read the statement.\u0027All of us here have tremendous appreciation for the dedication and passion she brought to the show every day and for her generous role as an ambassador for CBS Daytime.

Bills said without the untimely deaths and an inheritance left by his uncle there was no way Gainsborough could have afforded to train as a young artist in London.There are gaps in the story that may never be filled in, including who the perpetrators were, but the bones of the crime story are there. The uncle and and his son were successful businessmen with interests in Suffolk and London. Their downfall came when they were involved in pursuing debts owed to John Barnard, a Sudbury mercer, evidently leading them in to the path of dangerous criminals.The Art Newspaper has also been involved in the research, tracking down brutal threatening letters directed against the cousin. One read: “We will either shoot him or hang him up in gibbets, damn the … rogue’s arse.”The letters claim the Gainsboroughs ruined a friend, Richard Brock, who was being pursued over the debt. It demanded they stop. “We will come down and blow you up with gunpowder, God damn you” – or else feed “a meal that you will not like”.An ultimatum was given to drop the claim against Brock. Within a week the cousin was dead. The uncle was undeterred and continued to pursue the debt. He was killed six months later at the Golden Fleece in Cornhill in the City of London, a pub very close to the coach stop from Sudbury.Months before his murder, the uncle remade his will and one of his biggest wishes was that his young nephew Thomas should get a good start in life. He left £40 for him to find “a light handicraft”. It was money that allowed the family to send him to London aged 13 to train as an artist under the engraver Hubert Gravelot.Bills said there must have been fears for the safety of the artist’s father and family and that was a factor in moving the boy to the anonymity of the capital.The events, and the fact that Gainsborough’s father was hopeless with money and had been bankrupted, had a profound impact on Gainsborough. He married a woman with a guaranteed income and undertook portraiture that provided good money over his greater passion for painting landscapes.“I think people who have been really poor never lose that concern about money,” Bills said.The revelations feature in an exhibition opening at the museum in October, featuring 40 works from private and public collections.• Early Gainsborough: From the Obscurity of a Country Town is at Gainsborough’s House, Sudbury, 20 October-17 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cfe1a253f8ba344b095b0127ab9a2f5a15e3690/393_720_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd38cb472ba65705944ea2c1cccc8ce5","title":"royal navy photographic competition winners in pictures","story":"The winners of the Royal Navy photographic competition, the Peregrine trophy awards, have been announced.

For many of the city’s suits, sleep is often fleeting.It’s the same in many cities around the world, with working hours and lengthy commutes encroaching on bedtimes. Sleeplessness seems a particular problem – even a badge of honour – in urban centres of power and innovation, with rest long derided as an opportunity cost by society’s leaders. Margaret Thatcher claimed to sleep just four hours a night – now it’s Elon Musk defending his 120-hour work weeks, telling Arianna Huffington that sleep is not an option.A growing industry has emerged to offer short-term respite to weary workers. In Tokyo, Madrid, New York and many other cities around the world, nap time is being monetised through sleep pods like those belonging to Pop \u0026amp Rest, a new startup in London. At its Shoreditch base customers pay £15 to sleep for an hour while listening to ocean waves and inhaling scented oils.When scoping out cities for further expansion, founder Mauricio Villamizar tells me he maps urban commuting times the longer people commute to work, the less time they spend in bed. “As long as a city has a dense population of commuters and a business district, there’s a market for us,” he says.But commuting times alone don’t show which city gets the least shuteye. Noise, light pollution, sunset times and inidual factors like income all play a part. Where researchers once depended on labs for data, the arrival of fitness-tracking wristbands has made it possible to study entire cities – and find out which one sleeps the least.According to 2014 data from Jawbone wearable technology, it is Japan’s capital city, where people clock an average five hours and 46 minutes each night. The data, collected from 1,600 people across 21 cities, found that Melbourne gets the most sleep, averaging 7 hours and 5 minutes each night. Close second is London, where people sleep for 7 hours and 2 minutes. Tokyo, Seoul and Dubai sit at the bottom end of the sleep spectrum. But the Jawbone data set, while sizeable, only represents those who were able to afford one of the gadgets.Matthew Gibson, an economist who studies sleep and productivity, reckons that rest is linked to a city’s sunset time – and its wages. Gibson began thinking about sleep late one night while driving to a conference with his colleague, Jeffrey Shrader. The two professors were discussing the papers that their advisors wouldn’t want them to write. “We thought: ‘sleep takes up a third of our lives, but nobody in economics is looking at it’,” he says by phone from his Massachusetts office.Using Salt Lake City and Denver as examples, Gibson and Shrader’s theory is striking. The two cities occupy the same US time zone, but in Denver the sun sets almost 30 minutes earlier. According to 2016 data from the US Census Bureau, Denver’s average household income was $7,446 (£5,695) higher than that of Salt Lake City.But there’s a chicken-and-egg relationship between sleep and wages, Gibson cautions – sleep can be both a cause and consequence of income. Getting little sleep may be one of the reasons why someone is paid less, because it runs down their productivity and physical health. Conversely, concerns about money may make it more difficult to sleep.This two-way relationship complicates researchers’ efforts to determine whether sleep deprivation causes poverty, or vice versa. It’s also tricky to figure out how much sleep deprivation among the urban poor is due to environmental factors like noise, crime and light pollution, which all affect one’s ability to sleep easy at night.But if poor sleep is generally correlated with lower wages, do poorer cities sleep less? It’s hard to test the hypothesis, there being far less information about sleep patterns in cities near the equator than about western cities.In Chennai, on India’s east coast, people fall asleep in improbable locations – by roadsides, on the back of cycle rickshaws, and in noisy and crowded streets. When development economist Heather Schofield first visited the city, she was struck by its numerous daytime sleepers. “They got me thinking – how tired must people be to fall asleep in these crazy places?” she says.Night-time is frenetic in Chennai, where overcrowding and noise stem from rapid urbanisation and widespread poverty. Schofield describes how four or five people might be trying to sleep in a single room, with trucks rumbling past their door, in 90F (32C) degree heat, circled by thirsty mosquitos. On top of this are the compounded stresses of living in poverty.Among development economists, sleep isn’t a mainstream subject. Schofield wants to change that, and as a result, the lab run by Schofield and colleagues in Chennai is pioneering a study into the impact of improved sleep on poverty reduction. So far, the lab has found that participants sleep an average of five and a half hours a night. By distributing sleep mats and earplugs, it has managed to increase night-time sleep by an extra 30 minutes.Yet if less sleep is associated with lower wages, shouldn’t people in Tokyo, where average incomes are higher, be getting more sleep than those in Chennai?The results don’t necessarily tally with what we expect. In fact, sleep may have more to do with whether people feel in control of their circumstances than the amount of money they earn. Michael Grandner, a psychologist at the University of Arizona, explains that exceeding a comfortable income bracket tends to be associated with sleeping less – not more.This pattern can be explained by how much control iniduals feel they have over their sleep patterns. As Grandner puts it, “Some people need to work three jobs to put food on the table. For others, their time is too valuable to take a break. Neither feels like they can afford to sleep”.Ultimately, that means for people living in crowded Chennai or overworked Tokyo, sleep is more likely to feel beyond their control – and therefore be fleeting.Follow  Cities on\u0026nbspTwitter,\u0026nbspFacebook\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspInstagram\u0026nbspto join the discussion, and\u0026nbspexplore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917f93dac618043a3d03762d745e7d525a358a09/175_0_1787_1072/master/1787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58806c7f14f9e1265b3d8be426d97490","title":"europe labour left alt right corbynites steve bannon","story":"Dotted around Labour conference in Liverpool are T-shirts bearing the slogan “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit”, which is not an unusual combination but an increasingly unstable one. It is meant as a declaration but comes across as a plea – urging the leader to reward the devotion of his fans with a sign that he shares their pain at the prospect of leaving the European Union. He doesn’t.Jeremy Corbyn’s attitude towards Brexit is not mysterious. He was a critic of the EU before the referendum, declared himself a tepid supporter of membership during the campaign and showed not a flicker of sorrow at the result. Despite emotional aversion to Brexit among Labour members, the leader is up for leaving.Campaigners pushing for another referendum forced the issue on to the agenda in Liverpool, but in terms of policy change they got only a foot in the door. It was decided after hours of haggling that the second-vote option should be left “on the table” if the party’s preferred outcome – a general election – doesn’t materialise.Some of Corbyn’s oldest allies then made it clear that a plebiscite should exclude the option of remaining in the EU on current terms. Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union, and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, have both said the rival proposition to a Brexit deal would be exiting with no deal. But it is also Labour policy to “vigorously” oppose no deal and to vote against the Brexit that Theresa May is trying to negotiate. The absurd equation is that the opposition is against May’s deal, against no deal, but not against a referendum inviting people to choose between May’s deal and no deal.Much of Labour’s difficulty flows from the problem of appealing both to the current, pro-EU supporter base and a different, target electorate in constituencies that voted leave. The best defence of Corbyn’s position is that many of those Brexit backers thought they were delivering a once-in-a-generation ballot-box boot to the political class. Quitting the EU makes practical remedies harder to deliver for those people, but that is not an easy pitch. There is a noxious hauteur in telling people the thing they wanted is not what they really needed.The riposte is that politicians who see a national calamity unfolding have a patriotic duty to avert it. If voters are unpersuaded that Brexit is a mistake, the task is better persuasion, not surrender to the error. Corbyn’s most vaunted skill is meant to be evangelism. He is credited with single-handedly shifting Britain’s political centre of gravity leftward. If his magnetism really works as advertised it could surely be deployed to reorient European debate. But that never happens.The reason is not electoral calculus but allergy to defence of the status quo. There is a strain of Corbynism that is hostile to the set of postwar institutions that were bulwarks of the “west” during the cold war and, after it, upheld a hegemonic capitalist world order. In radical left demonology they are instruments of imperialist exploitation. The EU is not a prominent monster in that villainous hierarchy – it is no Nato or World Bank – but it is a member of the same extended family. It is not something leftists in the Corbyn-McDonnell-McCluskey mould instinctively defend.What makes this awkward in relations with younger and less doctrinaire Corbynites is that in 2018 the prominent challenge to that western institutional order comes from the far right. For many Labour people, Brexit was one of twin traumas in 2016, the other being Donald Trump’s election. The most effective insurgency against the European status quo today is racist and nationalistic. And so, regardless of any noble interior motive, the practical result of tagging along with an anti-EU project is tactical alignment with a wrecking enterprise that has Steve Bannon as its guru, Boris Johnson as its British proconsul and Russia as its immediate strategic beneficiary.Corbyn’s team will never recognise in themselves a symmetrical alt-left to the “alt-right” menace they revile. The two tribes envisage very different end-states. But there is between them a cultural affinity in the romantic fantasy of creative destruction a similar quickening of the pulse at the prospect of the old order crumbling. Tory Brexit-pushers and Labour Brexit-enablers both have an ear for the music of breaking glass and a shared secret: their plans require things to get worse for most people before anything would get better.None of this means that Labour’s European position is settled. The leader’s team likes power more than it dislikes the EU and is capable of pragmatism. It is mindful of the “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit” crowd and if it looks as though pro-remain feeling is cannibalising affection for the man they call just “Jeremy”, he will shift.But there is also a looming scenario in which the UK crashes out of the EU, causing chaos and misery, for which the Tories get all the blame. Labour then scoops up the votes of the immiserated. It isn’t a position that anyone around Corbyn will express out loud because it sounds brutal and cynical: no one will trumpet a plan of complicity with Conservative no-deal maniacs to engineer a crisis in the hope of capitalising on public pain. The Tory right and Labour left are supposed to be miles apart on the spectrum, diametrically opposed foes.

As usual, time will tell but both the speech and the response have the potential to push Labour, and Britain, towards the eventual, but still improbable, reopening of the entire Brexit issue.Starmer isn’t one of the great natural party conference orators. You still feel that he is learning how to perform some of the baser political skills that don’t always come naturally to a senior barrister. But there was no missing the zinger that he launched into the Liverpool hall towards the end of a well-argued speech about Brexit – or its effect.All the focus before Labour’s Brexit debate today had been on the second referendum. The speculation centred on how Starmer and the party would navigate the delicate politics of Labour’s conditional embrace this week of a “people’s vote” on the Brexit outcome this autumn.When he got to that part of his speech, Starmer was unapologetic. If Labour cannot bring down the Conservative government over Brexit this winter, there have to be other options, he said. These must include a campaign for a public vote.Starmer avoided getting too deep into the theology of what might be on the ballot paper – the issue that had ranged John McDonnell and Len McCluskey against the party’s pro-European majority in the last 48 hours. But it was the words that followed that set the debate alight.“Nobody,” said Starmer, “is ruling out remain as an option.” The response in the hall to that was immediate. First an instant volley of applause, but then, from deeper in the hall, and somehow also from somewhere deeper in the gut of the party conference, came the cheering, prolonged and surging, and then the standing ovation.It was a powerful moment. As someone who has been reporting party conferences for a very long time, I can’t remember all that many like it in any party. It’s rare for a politician, even addressing their supporters, to hit the spot with something truly unexpected and powerful. But Starmer’s embrace of the possibility of remaining in the EU hit that spot unerringly. It was, it seems, an improvised addition to the speech. The words weren’t in the planned text. But the words mattered – and so did the response in the hall. Most were on their feet. The applause went on and on. This was, it suddenly felt, a Labour party that really is up for a fight to preserve Britain’s place in Europe.That won’t have gone down well with those in the Labour party who see everything in terms of whether it is a challenge to the leader. But Jeremy Corbyn, along with McDonnell and McCluskey, does not want to see Labour drawn down the road of refighting the issue of UK membership of the EU. The reasons for that caution differ: some, like Corbyn, are anti-EU others, perhaps like McDonnell, are more pragmatic.In his closing words, Starmer seemed to be aware of that. The millions who voted for Brexit sent an immense message about the state of Britain, he acknowledged. Much of the rest of the conference Brexit debate was ill-focused and without the quality that Labour remainers will need to summon if this is to go all the way. But Starmer has started something here. He is going to have to carry it through. And, judging by the response in the hall – not always the most reliable guide to public opinion, it has to be said – there are plenty of people willing him on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28d520274bb6453fc3b1d2158babc8a8fb742484/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=506714d7f916b8044c3152bf8ade02fa","title":"republican party face wrath women","story":"Women aren’t just mad – they’re organized and mobilized politically in a way we’ve never quite seen beforeIf there’s cause for hope in these horror-show days, it’s this: The Republican party has no idea what’s about to hit it this November.Even the dimmest and most misogynist of Republican operatives must realize, by this point, that the supreme court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and the handling of the sexual assault allegations against him will hurt their chances, especially with women voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.What they don’t seem to realize, though, is that huge numbers of women aren’t just mad – they’re organized and mobilized politically in a way we’ve never quite seen before. The key story of the midterms is the large number of progressive women – and to a lesser extent, progressive men – who have been taking on the crucial, unglamorous work that swings elections: registering voters, canvassing door-to-door, preparing to get people to the polls. The disdain for women that the Republicans have shown by continuing to rally behind Kavanaugh is only energizing them further.The anguish and courage reflected in the cascade of #WhyIDidntReport stories is deeply personal, but the fallout is sure to be directly political. Well before the president who has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault nominated a man now repeatedly accused of sexual assault to a lifetime position on the highest court in the land, women were laying the groundwork for a historic political reckoning this fall. Of course there are women, mainly white women, who retain their allegiance to the Republican party their ranks, though, are very unlikely to expand. By contrast, the rage of millions of women, including overwhelming majorities of women of color, is now laser-focused on the Republican party – and there’s a robust grassroots infrastructure in place to make sure it is expressed at the ballot box this November.Ever since Donald Trump took the oath of office, the wrath of women has found expression in a remarkable growth of activism and grassroots organizing. When millions of Americans joined the Women’s Marches around the country in January 2017, the outpouring was a harbinger of what was to come: a multi-issue, women-led upsurge of political engagement on an unprecedented scale. Nearly 25,000 protests have taken place since Trump’s inauguration, involving somewhere between 14 and 21 million Americans. These figures greatly exceed levels of protest participation at any prior time in US history, even the height of the Vietnam war. And no matter the issue or focus of the demonstrations, women have consistently been the majority of those taking to the streets.Protests are only the most visible manifestation of what’s been happening at the grassroots, however. Quietly and persistently, women have also been pursuing a powerful electoral ground game that’s striking in both its scale and its character. During some past eras in American history when demonstrations surged, there was a gulf between protest politics and electoral activism, with those who marched in the streets shunning electoral work as impossibly compromised. That gulf has utterly vanished in the Trump era, with a clear-eyed pragmatism taking its place: “Voting,” one activist friend likes to say, “is a form of harm reduction.”If the resistance movements of our time have rejected the kind of outsider purity that kept some of their predecessors sidelined from electoral engagement, they are also strikingly independent of the Democratic party, which as a whole has been all too unwilling to translate anti-Trump rhetoric into muscular action. Substantial mobilizing for the midterms is being done through the vast array of local grassroots groups that formed after Trump took office, including the 5,000 groups affiliated with Inisible. Like the resistance to Trump more generally, these groups are typically women-led and have already played a key role in a series of progressive electoral upsets, including Doug Jones’s Senate victory in Alabama last December to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s highly publicized primary win this past June. Their autonomy from the Democratic party gives much of their work an under-the-radar quality that can obscure their impact one New York Times write-up of their role in the November 2017 special elections in Virginia disparaged them as “inchoate volunteer armies” even as it gave them substantial credit for Democrats’ success.The anger surrounding Brett Kavanaugh and the Republican leaders determined to “plow right through” with his nomination will only make those volunteer armies grow in both size and significance. Republicans have galvanized a backlash that will have profound electoral consequences. Women’s anger is often thought of as uncontrolled, as “dangerous and unhinged”, as Soraya Chemaly writes in Rage Becomes Her, one of several important new books that examine the meaning and contours of women’s wrath."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60f6cd03c5c089861f9e11f2f0710cfda80bba0/171_115_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3725b8b0137d07e5da3978e913c91a9b","title":"ebb and flow britains tidal coastline in pictures","story":"Photographers David Levene and Christopher Thomond picked spots around Britain’s coastline at high and low tideby  David Levene and  Christopher Thomond Words by  Patrick BarkhamThe tide is a long wave. The vertical movement of water pulled by a constellation of air pressure, wind, topography, the sun and the elliptical orbit of the moon is rarely visible to the naked eye. Instead we see the impact of this irrepressible force on our coastline roughly every six hours, when the tide is high and when it is low.The British coast has some of the mightiest tides in the world – the Bristol Channel has the second biggest rise and fall after Nova Scotia – and two  photographers, David Levene and Christopher Thomond, spent much of the summer exploring how the tide’s ebb and flow reveals different worlds.Arnside in Lancashire. Photographs: Christopher ThomondThomond relied on his naked eye to line up each high- and low-tide image. “I found them quite a struggle – technically it was difficult to line the two pictures up in your head,” he admits. “I’d find a vantage point at low tide and come back eight hours later and the markers I had in my head to line up the image had disappeared.”Thomond says people probably imagine taking pictures of tides at beautiful coastline spots to be a rather lovely holiday job, but the reality was he had to squeeze in the work between more mundane tasks. The “pure practicalities” – particularly getting two pictures in good light – overtook any pleasure in admiring the liminal world revealed and then covered by the tide, he says. “I didn’t choose a view, set up the tripod, wait for six hours and take another picture. I shot five or six scenes from the same area and tried to get some variety and replicate each one. You could never quite predict how somewhere was going to look at high tide.”Fossil hunting at Lyme Regis, Dorset. Photographs: David LeveneLevene tried to begin with a compelling low-tide picture. The biggest challenge was obtaining the high-tide picture of Lyme Regis on one of the hottest days of the year. He took the low-tide image of fossil hunters from the top of a fragment of eroding cliff that was only accessible at low tide. “I then had to wake at the crack of dawn, come down with a coffee and suncream and walk out at low tide and wait for the high tide, so I was sat out there in the heatwave for about eight hours.”The Wash from Snettisham, Norfolk. Photographs: David LeveneLevene was often too busy trying different photographic positions or checking tidal apps to experience the meditative beauty of the ebb and flow of the tide. But he was moved by the unexpected drama of the North Sea flooding over great expanse of the Wash at Snettisham.“The way that the water came in through the mudflats was just amazing,” he says. “It takes forever to come in but for the last 40 minutes the channels suddenly fill up. I was taking pictures all the while.”Taking the photographs from exactly the same position was sometimes unexpectedly difficult. Levene imagined he might mark the spot for his tripod and return six hours later, but in often busy places or natural beaches it wasn’t possible to leave a durable mark.Instead he used his eye. “You’ve got to fidget yourself into the right position by looking at the original picture you’ve taken and use reference points from it,” he says. To get a really precise match, Levene also plugged his camera into his computer at his tide-watching spot to overlay the original picture with the new image revealed by the camera.Crosby beach in Merseyside. Photographs: Christopher ThomondLevene learned that the Creekside Discovery Centre runs weekly walks on the mysterious mud of Deptford Creek in London, which gave him an interesting picture.

Gonzalez is also the principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service but conducted and spoke about the research in his university capacity.They are particularly vulnerable because most US park land is in areas that are heating up quicker: in the mountains, the Arctic and the dry south-west.Gonzalez explained that parks at a higher elevation have a thinner atmosphere that warms faster. Hotter temperatures are also melting snow cover and making the ground darker so that it absorbs more heat. Parks in California and the south-west US have seen both high temperatures and record-low rainfall, he said.The research is the first comprehensive look at climate change impacts on national parks, Gonzalez said. He said he has been using the climate impacts research to develop plans for parks to adapt and reduce the greenhouse gas pollution they contribute.The Trump administration has rescinded government efforts to slow climate change. The interior department, where the National Park Service is housed, nixed a policy that would have urged management decisions based on science, including climate change research. Park officials in New England scrubbed references to climate change and flooding risks in a report this summer, according to Reveal. The National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the study or climate change policies for parks.Jonathan Jarvis, the National Park Service director under Barack Obama who now also works at UC Berkeley, said he relied on climate change projections to decide where to relocate and bolster structures in the Everglades national park in Florida, an area that has been hit by hurricanes and faces sea-level rise.Jarvis said he worries that under Trump parks won’t be able to plan long-term for climate change.“The park service manages these assets, these places, for the benefit of the American people, and they should be based on the best available sound science in the long-term public interest, not for some short-term political agenda,” Jarvis said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb8151250f6346832ec296f7163c3ac3981302d/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1277225f717cd427bc6a689c04a9b283","title":"michael kors buys versace capri donatella","story":"Donatella Versace to stay on at Italian label and US fashion company to rebrand as CapriMichael Kors has confirmed its acquisition of Italian fashion house Versace for $2.1 bn (£1.6bn).Donatella Versace, the brand’s artistic director and sister of founder Gianni Versace, will continue to lead the creative side of the business.Versace boss Jonathan Akeroyd will also remain in place along with the rest of the brand’s senior management.Michael Kors also said it will rename itself Capri Holdings upon the closing of the deal.The enlarged Capri will comprise of three global fashion brands: Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo.John D Idol, the Michael Kors chief executive and chairman, said that the company was committed to investing in Versace’s growth, with a goal to grow revenues to over $2bn (£1.5bn).“We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth,” he said.Michael Kors acquired shoe brand Jimmy Choo last year in a deal worth £896m.

Local distributor Entertainment One should be content with that result.The film faced the challenge of a 12A certificate, which might have put off some families with younger children. However, a cast including Jack Black and Cate Blanchett, with Eli Roth in the director’s chair, might have helped to position the film more appealingly for an adult audience. Source material is John Bellairs’ 1973 novel of the same title – the first in a series of 12 books featuring the orphan Lewis Barnavelt.The film opened in the US with $26.6m (£20.2m), so the UK number is in line with that outcome. Recent Amblin productions include Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Ready Player One, The Post, A Dog’s Purpose and The BFG. The last of those titles seems the most relevant yardstick for this new film, but the huge local popularity of author Roald Dahl invalidates the comparison. The BFG began in the UK with £5.29m in July 2016.Recent commercial precedents for a darkly comic missing-person thriller are difficlut to pinpoint, and director Paul Feig is best known for pure comedies featuring Melissa McCarthy, so the commercial outcome for his A Simple Favour was hard to call. Lead actor Anna Kendrick is relatively unproved outside the Pitch Perfect franchise, and co-star Blake Lively remains best known for TV’s Gossip Girl.Given these factors, distributor Lionsgate should easily be happy with a £1.32m opening, and £1.62m including previews. The film is based on a novel by Darcey Bell, and Lionsgate was happy to push any associations with Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train – differently toned films adapted from bestsellers with female-skewing audiences. A Simple Favour was never going to perform at the level of those two hits.Director Peter Berg has built a steady partnership with actor Mark Wahlberg since 2013, producing a trio of muscular films based on real-life events: Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon and Patriots Day. Mile 22 takes the pair into a purely fictional realm and thus into franchise potential, focusing on an elite US intelligence officer leading a covert tactical command unit. But if the response of UK audiences is representative, sequels now appear unlikely.Mile 22 opened in the territory with £559,000 for the weekend period and £796,000 including Wednesday and Thursday previews – only enough for sixth place in the chart. The film maxed out at an uninspiring $36m at US cinemas following its mid-August release.Cinema bookers have big hopes pinned on next month, which brings both A Star Is Born and Venom on 3 October, Johnny English Strikes Again two days later, and then the likes of Damien Chazelle’s First Man, David Gordon Green’s Halloween and Bryan Singer’s Bohemian Rhapsody. Meanwhile, there is one more weekend of September to struggle through – which offers the comedy Night School starring Kevin Hart and hot talent du jour Tiffany Haddish. Alternatives include Glenn Close in The Wife, which looks likely to connect with older and upscale audiences.1. The House With a Clock in Its Walls, £3,370,591 from 541 sites (new)2.

He is a close ally of the England manager, Gareth Southgate, within the set-up at St George’s Park, and drew up the elite player development plan known as ‘England DNA’ aimed at creating more successful sides across senior men’s and women’s football.With that in mind, Ashworth’s anticipated departure could be perceived as a blow to Southgate. The 47-year-old, a former player at Norwich City, previously held the technical director role at West Bromwich Albion in the top flight but, while at the FA, saw the national men’s under-17s and under-20s win their respective World Cups, the under-19s become European champions and the under-21s reach the semi-finals of the European Championship.The governing body are loathe to lose Ashworth, but have fielded Brighton’s interest and are increasingly resigned to the reality that he will move on. The technical director had been asked about his future during the World Cup in Russia, and suggested a return to the club game would appeal. “I’ve been here five and a half years,” he said. “I loved my time in club football and at some stage I’m sure I will go back – either when they get sick and bored of me here or when there is another opportunity.”Brighton, who finished 15th last season and have had to deflect interest from elsewhere to secure Ashworth, would offer him complete control of football operations from their state of the art training complex at Lancing, Sussex, and are confident agreement can be reached with the FA over compensation due.Albion have been using the London-based agency, Nolan Partners, to pursue potential candidates to fill the role. The appointment of a technical director would not affect the positions of the manager Chris Hughton, current head of recruitment Paul Winstanley, the academy manager John Morley or the head of medical services Adam Brett."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9273ccb2677aba0846d3bc1518ea5bf3ca1cdd/0_254_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bfa129afc1b5f41de1c894c52fc9653","title":"kevin keegan no im not going to take a compliment from mike ashley","story":"The former England captain shares memories of Bobby Moore and George Best, his regrets about managing Newcastle and England and why if he was a player today he’d like to turn out for Jürgen Klopp’s LiverpoolYou can feel the energy as soon as Kevin Keegan walks into the room – barrel chest, big biceps, warm smile, small man, tough handshake. His hair is white these days, the perm long gone, and his belly more rounded, but otherwise he is little changed. Keegan is as passionate and outspoken as he ever was.We meet in a hotel in Manchester. It’s funny that he’s written another memoir, he says, because he hates looking back. “I don’t like player reunions because all you get is the lads talking about whatever year you won something. A lot of them are just lost in that. Sir John Hall had a saying: ‘If you live in the past, you die in the past.’ You’ve got to reinvent yourself – try to move on.”He might not have much time for reminiscing, but with Keegan there is always a significant career anniversary to mark. So it’s 50 years since he made his debut for Scunthorpe United, 45 since he claimed the first of his three league titles with Liverpool, 40 since he won the first of two successive European Player of the Year awards at Hamburg, 25 since the season he managed Newcastle United to the first ision title, 20 next February since he was named England manager, and 10 since he walked out on Newcastle United for the second time (his last job in management).Few Englishmen have played and managed with such raw emotion. Keegan is a fascinating, and contradictory, character – one of the most decent, reliable and transparent men in football, yet at the same time short-fused, unpredictable and inscrutable. He has always been one of football’s great believers by nature an optimist and idealist. The flip side is a zero tolerance of cheats, bullshitters, and at times, you sense, even of himself.His book opens with him returning to St James’ Park in disguise after falling out with owner Mike Ashley who he felt had made him persona non grata. His second time managing Newcastle United was a horror show. Things came to a head in 2008 after discovering Ashley’s cronies had bought the Spaniard Xisco for £5.7m despite never having seen him play, and signed the Uruguayan Ignacio González on loan as a “favour” to two South American agents.When Keegan went ballistic he was told not to worry, he could just “park” González – he didn’t even have to play him in the reserves. Keegan quit, and was awarded £2m for constructive dismissal by a tribunal in 2009. I tell him I felt sickened when I read about the culture at the club. Yes, Keegan says, but Ashley’s Newcastle are not representative of modern football they are the worst of the worst. “They are a real one-off. I don’t know of a club that has been run as badly or with such disregard for people.”Ironically, Ashley called Keegan “the most honest man in football”. Does he accept that compliment? He smiles. “No, I’m not going to take a compliment from Mike Ashley.”Keegan has never been able to stay shtum when he sees slights and injustices. In the new book, pacily ghosted by the ’s Daniel Taylor, he doesn’t hold back. So he calls out Brian Clough for bullying, Alex Ferguson for gamesmanship, the FA for not supporting him as England manager, Bobby Robson for not telling him why he was dropping him from the England squad, Lawrie McMenemy for suggesting he was not trying in a Southampton match and calling his team cheats (for Keegan, the worst accusation you could make), Liverpool for their arrogance, Manchester City for their parsimony. And, of course, he doesn’t hold back on himself. After all, this is the man who said he wasn’t up to managing England and promptly quit.In his book The Chimp Paradox the psychiatrist Steve Peters says too much emotion is often the ruin of an athlete. It has certainly got the better of Keegan at times – when he got sent off for scrapping with Leeds United’s Billy Bremner in the 1974 Charity Shield the famous finger-jabbing “I will love it” rant when Newcastle were challenging Manchester United for the Premier League title and he allowed Ferguson’s mind-games to get the better of him. But it’s also been the making of him.Did she ever get upset with his impetuousness? “Jean used to say to me I was mad. She’d say: ‘You should have stayed there,’ but she knows that’s not for me.”Why has he left so many jobs? “I don’t like people to deceive me and tell me lies.” He taps the table and goes straight on to his next bete noire – clubs that lack ambition. Say the word “consolidate” to Keegan and he’ll head straight for the door – as happened with Manchester City. “If you’re not going forward, what’s the point in sticking around? If the chairman says we’re looking forward to consolidate, that’s the time for you to say as a manager we’ll go backwards.”George Best, a friend, said that as a player Keegan wasn’t fit to lace his boots. And in a way he was right. But what Keegan had was a ferocious determination. He chased like a terrier, ran defenders ragged, beat giant defenders in the air despite being only 5ft 7in, and willed himself into being one of the footballing greats. No player exceeded his potential like Keegan. He captained England 33 times and succeeded wherever he played – top scorer in the league at Southampton in 1982, a hero when he retired, helicoptered away from the adoring Newcastle fans at St James’ Park after his final game like the statue of Christ in La Dolce Vita. Keegan is the only British player to have won two Ballons d’Or.He admits he was the beneficiary of Best’s boozed-up unreliability. When Best didn’t turn up for gigs, they were passed on to Keegan. There were Keegan newspaper columns, Keegan football boots, even a Keegan hit record (Head Over Heels in Love).He adored Best. “I wanted so much to have his ability. His skill was unbelievable. I played against Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Maradona. But I still say Besty was the best I played against.”He has little time for those who say Best threw his life away. “I didn’t ever have anything other than maximum respect for Besty. He loved his life. He never left anything behind. He had a great life. He did all the things he wanted to do and nobody was going to stop him. That was his character.”Given that Keegan was not the most naturally gifted footballer, is he surprised by how much he achieved? “Yes, amazing really. I look at the players who have won the Ballon d’Or, right back to Stanley Matthews. You’ve got players in there like Platini and Cruyff. Then you see my name there twice!”I ask Keegan what has given him most happiness in football. He doesn’t mention the trophies or personal achievements. “Bobby Moore leading me out for England, with Alf Ramsey as manager. That was unbelievable. Bobby Moore saying when I joined the England squad: ‘We’re going out tonight, be down at seven’, and he had a big red Jag and took eight or 10 of us into town to a club. It would be illegal now. That was very special.” He looks emotional, just thinking about it. “Nothing beat playing for England for me. Being made captain, leading your team out. We never did great in my time, but that’s probably the happiest it gets.”But he has few happy memories of his time as England manager. Keegan lasted 20 months and 18 games, winning only seven of them – the worst win ratio of any England manager, and his one true failure in football. Why did he say he wasn’t up to the job when he quit? “I wasn’t. I didn’t like it – that’s another way of putting it. I like everyday team‑building with players. People say, ‘Well tactically you weren’t very good’, but tactically what can you do with players when you don’t have them?”I mention he has never been sacked as a manager. Keegan drums his fingers on the table. “I would have been sacked as England manager after the Germany game. I’d already been told by the FA that results had to improve. So I just made it easy for them. But yeah, I walked away from a lot of money if that’s what you’re saying.”Despite England reaching the semi-final of this year’s World Cup, he still believes the job is a poisoned chalice. Is it a big ask for Gareth Southgate to take England further forward? “Well, I think it is because I’m sure if you got Gareth in a room and said truthfully did you expect to get this far, he’d say no … He’s got the same problem that England have had for a long time since Gazza went. Where’s your Eden Hazard, your David Silva, your De Bruyne? Where are they? There’s an orchestra there, but nobody to conduct.”Actually, he says, for England to succeed long term, Southgate would have to be a miracle-worker. He believes Southgate’s biggest challenge is that many squad members are not even regulars in their team. “There’s the miracle he’s got to work whereby he’s got players sat on benches watching players, and expect them to play against those players who are playing every week and have leadership roles in the team.” And he talks about the other problems – the reluctance of the big clubs to give English kids a chance despite nurturing them in their academies the failure to appoint successful English managers such as Eddie Howe to the top jobs, the exaltation of foreign managers who park the bus and are called defensive maestros. “‘It’s a Mourinho masterclass.’ I get the feeling if that had been me or Sam Allardyce ... ppfff, we wouldn’t get away with it.”Keegan has always seemed content in his prolonged periods away from football. “I miss the banter with players as a manager. I miss playing, but I’ve been missing that for 34 years. Nothing beats playing. Management is just a way of staying in the game you love for a bit longer …” He grins. “And sometimes very short periods.”In his book, he points out that Winston Churchill was 76 when he began his second term as prime minister. Could Keegan be tempted back for one final stint in management? “I have had opportunities, that’s for sure. I don’t think it’s going to happen, but when you say that you’ve got to be careful … because if someone came in like Sir John Hall did and said, ‘You’ve got the passion, I’ve got the money’, you think, ‘Wow, we could do something there’.” He is juggling the possibilities in his head. “I’m 67, almost 68,” he says, apparently writing himself off. But a second later there’s a glint in his eye. “I wouldn’t be the oldest manager!”Kevin Keegan: My Life in Football will be published by Macmillan on 4 October, £20."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1629ce5c657dc351bdf47797200e9c10f3e77c3/81_306_928_557/master/928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9098efd983a301c6ac3a92758ab85cf","title":"david squires on no country for proper football men","story":"Our cartoonist on the latest chapter of a season that seems to so far have been exclusively of interest to Liverpool fans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22e61b71493f5ad7cca7dc7c113bd7a1611d0a21/0_0_4515_2709/master/4515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa4160cbdcd28f16b474e71c88437230","title":"abiy ahmed miracle ethiopia democratic awakening","story":"Under the transformative regime of prime minister Abiy Ahmed, a reformist from Oromia, exiled dissidents are being welcomed home. Yet the loosening of state control has also sparked an upsurge in violence by  Tom Gardner and Charlie RosserSomething extraordinary is happening in Ethiopia. Under new prime minister Abiy Ahmed, authoritarianism and state brutality appear to be giving way to something resembling democracy. A country that began the year crippled by anti-government protests is now being lauded as a model for the region. One of Africa’s most autocratic ruling parties, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), is today led by a man who professes to believe deeply in freedom of expression.In the capital, Addis Ababa, huge crowds have been welcoming home exiled dissidents. Residents who once feared speaking publicly about politics now talk of little else. Flags and symbols long banned by the EPRDF blossom across the city.But it is also a time of deep anxiety. The unprecedented loosening of state control has been accompanied by an upsurge in ethnic violence and widespread lawlessness. Hate speech thrives on social media. Groups with starkly contrasting visions for the country have clashed on the streets of the capital. On 19 September the government began its first clampdown, arresting hundreds of people suspected of orchestrating violence. “Abiymania”, as it has become known, may not last forever.In Addis Ababa the face of Abiy Ahmed is almost ubiquitous, emblazoned on stickers, posters, T-shirts and books. Some of his most enthusiastic supporters liken him to a prophet. “Without Abiy we would be doing nothing,” says Asrat Abere, a taxi driver and father of two. “If he had time he could change everything.”Some worry that “Abiymania” is a personality cult others liken it to the sort of adoration that has often followed Ethiopian leaders, including the former emperor, Haile Selassie.“There’s an inclination in the Ethiopian population to have more faith in charismatic leaders than in political parties or institutions,” says Goitum Gebreluel, an Ethiopian researcher at Cambridge University. “Abiy has been able to cultivate that cleverly.”On 9 September, two days before Ethiopian New Year, thousands of Addis Ababa’s residents arrived in the central square and national stadium to welcome exiled opposition leader Berhanu Nega, who was elected mayor of the city in disputed 2005 elections before being jailed and eventually fleeing the country. He leads the opposition movement Ginbot 7, which had been labelled a terrorist organisation before Abiy took office in April.Supporters of Ginbot 7 have been enthusiastically waving the old Ethiopian flag, which lacks the star emblem associated with the EPRDF, and calling for unity between Ethiopia’s many ethnic groups.Many attending the rally credited Abiy with allowing their political heroes to return to Ethiopia. “The country is now democratic,” says Stentehu, a Ginbot 7 supporter. “Abiy is amazing – he is just like my father, my brother. He is family.”“This is a day of love,” says Admasu, in a thick American accent. “Abiy is our miracle one – all of this is happening because of him.”“Today is our victory day,” says Belanesh Mengistu, sitting on the steps of Addis Ababa’s Meskel Square with her sisters. “We have worked 27 years in slavery. Now things are gradually improving. We have a bright future.”On 15 September another huge rally took place in Addis Ababa, this time for supporters of the previously banned Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), whose long-exiled leader, Dawud Ibsa, returned from neighbouring Eritrea.The OLF’s once-banned flag is now a public symbol of resistance for many of the young ethnic Oromos, known as the Qeerroo, whose anti-government protests brought Abiy (also an Oromo) to power.Many young Qeerroo jogged in formation through Addis Ababa before the rally, singing in the Oromo language, waving the OLF flag and carrying traditional wooden sticks.“I’m here to welcome the OLF – freedom fighters,” says Lemi Mamo, a 26-year-old doctor. “I’m also really a supporter of Abiy Ahmed. He’s making the country democratic. Everybody can express what he feels.”Before the event, which was peaceful and festive, there were clashes between city residents and young Qeerroo from the Oromo hinterland.Shortly after the OLF rally, violence broke out on the outskirts of the capital. Twenty-three people were reported killed in ethnic conflict, amid clashes between groups associated with Ginbot 7 and the OLF. On 17 September thousands took the to the streets of Addis Ababa to demand that the government stop the bloodshed, after five people were killed by security forces as riot police and red-capped commandos took control of the city."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0fdcd38006ba7bc80140e8ded7974aabd86cf56/0_327_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ff78b602b8685ca57ae4394c5e5ef73f","title":"truth about polyamory monogamy open relationships","story":"More and more young people are abandoning monogamy in favour of open relationships. But is it really that easy to turn your back on jealousy? And what about all the admin?Alex Sanson is nervous. She is hosting a dinner party this Friday, and wants it to go well, because her lovers are coming – all of them. “Cooking for one person you fancy is hard enough, but three of them is even more stressful!” says Sanson, who has brown hair, an open, friendly face and a bookish air..Sanson is polyamorous, meaning that she has multiple romantic and sexual partners, all of whom are aware of the others’ existence. Currently, the 28-year-old is in a “polycule” with three other people: William, Mike and Laura, all of whom are also dating the other members of the polycule.Dinner-party jitters aside, things are going swimmingly for Sanson, who works in marketing. “There’s so much joy in being poly,” she says. “It’s lovely not to burden one person with all your stuff. You just spread it all out.”Polyamory, also known as consensual non-monogamy, seems to be growing in popularity among young people, though with no definitive figures it’s hard to know how much of this is a matter of increased visibility. It comes in many shapes and forms, from open relationships (where in layperson’s terms you “cheat” on your partner, but they are aware and do not mind, and do the same to you), to solo polyamory, where you identify as polyamorous, but are not currently in multiple relationships. But all those involved reject monogamy as stifling, or oppressive, or simply not to their taste.“It’s not as complicated as people make it sound,” Sanson insists. If you are unsure whether polyamory might suit you, try this simple thought experiment: does the thought of your partner in the first flushes of romantic ardour with another person fill you with contentment, lust, indifference, or murderous rage? If it’s the last one, best to swerve polyamory. (There’s a term for the warm feeling polyamorous people experience when seeing their partners with someone else: compersion.)“I’ve had people saying to me, ‘You just want to fuck about!’” says 29-year-old Calum James, who identifies as a heteroflexible pansexual solo polyamorous relationship anarchist. What this basically means is that James, who is mostly straight, is not currently in a polyamorous relationship with a person or persons. If he were, he would regard it as no more important than non-intimate friendships, because relationship anarchists treat romantic and non-romantic relationships the same.“I had one woman have a go at me, saying, ‘It’s an awful way to treat women,’” James says. “But people don’t understand it’s not just about meeting women and having sex with them. I want to build deep connections with people and see them regularly. I just don’t want those connections to follow the same rules as traditional relationships.”James tried monogamy, but found it “suffocating”. “I never understood monogamy, even when I was a kid. I’d think, ‘I fancy three people in my class.’”“The thing I’ve always disliked about monogamy and marriage,” Sanson adds, “is the idea of owning another person and them being your other half or somehow completing you, like you weren’t complete before you met them. What I love about polyamory is that I’m my own person and no one owns me. I don’t own any of you, either. We’re all free.”Polyamory is having a cultural moment right now, with celebrities such as Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith speaking about being non-monogamous, and the BBC drama Wanderlust depicting a middle-class couple as they open up their relationship. As anyone who lived through the 1960s, or who is from the LGBT community will tell you, polyamory is not new: free love or non-monogamy has been practised for years. But polyamory is now being adopted by people who might have been monogamous five or 10 years ago, not least because the internet makes it easier than ever for poly-curious people to educate themselves about polyamory, and connect with like-minded iniduals.“Things are changing rapidly,” says Janet Hardy, the co-author of the polyamory handbook The Ethical Slut. “More people are getting the idea that it’s possible to be happy and healthy without being monogamous. What I’m seeing among young people is that they don’t have the same need to self-define by what they like to do in bed, or in relationships, like my generation did. Everything’s out on a big buffet, and they try a little of everything.”Polyamorous people reject the end game of romantic monogamy, and disdain so-called “relationship escalators”: society’s expectation that couples will cycle through #putaringonit selfies, marriage and kids. Instead, they let their relationships flow whither the current takes them, relinquishing themselves to the whorls and eddies that change all romantic partnerships over time. In our increasingly precarious times, it makes sense that polyamory is popular. “Growing up, you’re bombarded by all this messaging about what the perfect relationship set-up is,” Sanson says. “You’re going to have a family and buy a house and do this and that. But a lot of that isn’t relevant to my generation.”Still, being polyamorous isn’t just a carefree romp. It requires you to unpick the messy yarn of human emotion, and that most familiar knot of all: jealousy. Perhaps the biggest myth of all about polyamorous people is that they don’t feel jealousy. “Jealousy is a part of human nature,” says 27-year-old William Jeffrey, a member of Sanson’s polycule. “You still feel it. But I’ve found with every jealousy I’ve ever had while being polyamorous, I’ve been able to trace the jealousy back to an insecurity about myself. When I figure out what the insecurity is, I can overcome it.”A responsible polyamorous partner accepts the other person’s jealousy. “When I started dating someone else, my partner Laura expressed that she was feeling jealous,” says Mike Scoins, 28, also in the polycule. “So I told her: ‘I acknowledge your feelings. Can we unpack the fear that is underlying your jealousy?’ In this instance, it was something along the lines of: ‘Do you still care about me?’ When you provide reassurance that, yes, absolutely, I do still care, the jealousy dissipates.”Is jealousy only ever the result of insecurity? “I’d say that’s too simplistic a view,” says Hardy. “I don’t think there’s one emotion you can call jealousy. I think jealousy is an umbrella we put over all of the emotions we find difficult that we want to quell by changing someone else’s behaviour.” In her introduction-to-polyamory workshops, Hardy asks participants to write a thank-you note to their jealousy. “It exists for a reason. Jealousy tries to protect you from something.”Can you really vanquish the green-eyed monster with introspection and communication alone? “Some people are more prone to jealousy, and some people are less prone to it,” Hardy says. “If polyamory sounds unpleasant, don’t do it! There are no merit badges here.”“I don’t really experience sexual jealousy,” Scoins muses. “My one experience of jealousy was when my then partner had two tickets for a ball and didn’t give me one.”There’s a joke about polyamory: it didn’t take off until Google Calendar was invented. The polyamorous people I interview effortlessly manage packed schedules. Jeffrey, for instance, will meet once a week to play a Buffy the Vampire Slayer role-playing game with Scoins and the fourth member of their polycule, Laura Nevo. He also has a weekly date night with his live-in partner, as well as seeing Sanson and Nevo once a week.While shows such as Wanderlust depict polyamory as a tumescent bonk-fest, in reality polyamorous people spend most of their time doing the deeply unsexy business of talking about their feelings. Sanson credits polyamory with giving her more emotional self-awareness. “Polyamory has allowed me to be more introspective, think about the motives behind what I’m doing, identify emotions more accurately and be explicit about how I’m feeling about things.”Polyamory tends to unnerve people, affronting expectations of traditional romantic monogamy. It’s harder for polyamorous people to date: apps such as Tinder or Bumble don’t have options for non-monogamous people, for instance. When James writes in his Tinder bio that he is non-monogamous, he experiences a “significant dip in matches”. And when he tells prospective romantic partners he is polyamorous, it rarely goes down well. “One date told me, ‘I was really interested in you until you told me that.’”Last New Year’s Eve, James went to a party in Sheffield, where he lives. When he walked in, heads swivelled. “They all went: ‘Is that the polyamorous one?’” James is weary of having to defend his way of life, and rightly so: consenting adults shouldn’t have to justify their sex lives to judgmental strangers. “Some people don’t recognise that what’s not right for them isn’t not right for other people,” he says. “I try to point out that it’s not harming anybody if it’s all open and honest.”And monogamous people can learn from polyamory. Twenty-three-year-old Aliyah, who uses theythem pronouns, was polyamorous, but is currently in a monogamous relationship. They credit polyamory with giving them a healthier outlook on monogamy. “The way I was taught monogamy wasn’t healthy,” Aliyah says. “I’d have this constant paranoia of being cheated on.”Polyamory made them better at monogamy. “I learned that monogamy doesn’t have to be as strict as we conceptualise it growing up,” they explain. “Before I felt that deep love should only be reserved for romantic connections. But being polyamorous taught me I have so much love for my friends, and that doesn’t have to be explored in a sexual context.”As polyamory becomes more visible, it won’t be seen as such a tear in our social fabric, but as an ordinary and unremarkable thing. This will be down to the efforts of a new generation who are normalising their freedom to live and love how they want, without nose-wrinkling or head-shaking.“My dad said to me to me the other day, ‘I’m worried about your emotional wellbeing, because you’re building relationships with these people,’” Sanson laughs. “And I was like, ‘I know! That’s the whole point.”Chiara Giovanni, 24, is in a relationship with two people. Her partner Aditya Sharad, 23, is monogamous.Chiara: I always struggled with monogamy and found it quite restrictive. Even though I was super-happy in my relationships, I wasn’t able to be monogamous and faithful. I decided to take a different tack. When I met Aditya I thought, I love this person and want to make them happy, and I need to do this differently. So I was open from the start.Ninety per cent of polyamory is talking. Sometimes I think, I want to watch a movie! I don’t want to talk about our relationship again. But it’s important to be able to express your fears, rather than waiting for the worst thing to happen.I definitely think more people would be polyamorous if they knew what polyamory was, and that it wasn’t just a phase, but valid and long-term and serious. Right now, I’m setting up a time for Aditya to meet my other partner, who is based in the US. They are both super-nervous and really want the other person to like them. It’s really cute.Aditya: At first, when a partner says, “I don’t think conventional relationship settings are working for me,” it’s hard to hear. While Chiari and I decided it would be a polyamorous relationship, I’m not a hugely social person, so it didn’t make a lot of sense for me to have multiple relationships. At the same time, I have a wonderful relationship with Chiara, who I really love. So I thought, let’s give this a try.Jealousy is never the main feeling. Something may trigger the jealousy, but it’s not a primary feeling. You’ll be feeling insecure about something, and that’s what the jealousy is about. You have to communicate about your feelings, and accept you’re not going to be given all the time and attention in your relationship.I do feel fulfilled. I wouldn’t have chosen to be poly myself, but I value Chiara. We have a joyous and uplifting relationship. So it’s not like her being polyamorous is a necessary evil. I’m just invested in what allows us to lead a life together, and what is important to her, and makes her happy.If you’d told me about polyamory eight years ago I’d have been like, “What, really, that works?” But it does. You need to be intentional about it, but it can work.Laura Nevo, 30, is part of a four-person polycule, along with William Jeffrey, Alex Sanson, and Mike Scoins.I started polyamory as an experiment. I had been in monogamous relationships all my life, and when I met my partner Mike he was honest with me. He said: “I like you, but I’m going to carry on dating other people.” I thought, fair enough. I did some research into polyamory and began to date multiple people. In previous monogamous relationships, I’d cheat on my partners and feel guilty about it. I didn’t want that to happen again.I’ve been dating Mike for two years and William for one year. I also hang out a lot with Alex, and there are other people I may have sex with. It gives me a lot of happiness to see my partners together, like William and Mike for example. It’s nice to be able to be happy for someone else, without having to be a part of their happiness.Recently, I had a challenge because one of my partners became involved with someone I really didn’t connect with. I’m trying to work through that and not bottle things up. I used to suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem, but I’ve found that polyamory helps me a lot, as I have to really figure things out.When someone new comes into our polycule, I’m extra careful of things. I think, how can we deal with this new person? How can we make them comfortable? Because it’s not nice to feel left out.Being polyamorous has felt freeing for me. It has allowed me to meet people I wouldn’t have considered as partners before. I’ve been playing more on the gender spectrum. If I were to go back to monogamy one day, I think the experience of being polyamorous would make me more accepting of people and different types of relationships.Andrea, 30, believes in ‘free and independent agency’Coming out as non-monogamous is a very slow process, because it’s so hard to bring yourself to a point where you know that the other person might terminate the relationship. Some choose to cheat, but I wanted to be open to the person I loved.When I came out as non-monogamous to my girlfriend at the time, she basically said: “I didn’t sign up for this. Why can’t I have the person I met back?” That really hurt, because I never wanted to cause her pain. But I can’t help being myself. We tried to make it work, but eventually we parted ways, because she was monogamous and I wasn’t. Everything else in the relationship worked, so that was really painful.It’s important to be open and communicate about anyone new coming into the scene. If I’m at a party and I meet someone I want to bring home, I text Anita, who I have a romantic and sexual relationship with, and let her know. And my secret tool is Google Calendar. If I’m on a date and Anita wants to hang out, she can just check my calendar for the next available slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd9fa67f97dfde718ef2922bcb1a48be7a896a9/0_1751_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85bed41d299ee3cceebb11e2def2a2e0","title":"yoga adriene mishler youtube interview","story":"With 4 million subscribers and hundreds of thousands more watching free weekly videos, Yoga with Adriene is a social media sensation. What makes her fans so devoted?There are more than 2,400 people in the main hall of Alexandra Palace in north London, breathing in unison. “Take the deepest breath you’ve taken all day,” says the woman at the front, “and let it out through the mouth.” Lungs empty en masse. It feels like we’re in the belly of a beast.The woman is 33-year-old yogi and actor Adriene Mishler, and this is the largest live yoga class she has ever held – she is more frequently to be found teaching alone in front of her camera at home in Austin, Texas, than IRL. And it is this intimate version of her that 4 million subscribers to her Yoga with Adriene YouTube channel have come to know and share their homes with. Her particularly popular videos – “Yoga Morning Fresh”, for instance, or “7-Minute Bedtime Yoga” – can get upwards of 2 million viewers. Search “yoga” on Google, and Adriene dominates.“You just want to be her friend,” says Magdalena Krohn, a 32-year-old teacher and performance artist who is at the Ally Pally event, queueing for a cashew curry. Karen Bradley, a 56-year-old health visitor, has travelled from Sheffield to see Adriene. Fifty-year-old civil servant Julie Ashen says she is “not that brilliant with people”, but has nevertheless travelled from Swansea to see Adriene in this setting. You must love her, I say. “I do. She’s quite a phenomenon.”When I tell friends I am meeting Adriene, they get a zealous look in their eyes: “I’m not hyperbolising when I say she changed my life,” more than one confesses – and I know they’re not, because she changed mine, too. Maybe it’s simplistic, but there is a lot to be said for being gently cajoled into focusing on the feeling of the soles of your feet on the yoga mat, when anxious thoughts have been jolting like runaway trains through your mind all day.We meet the day before the event, over an on-brand turmeric latte in an east London cafe. In real life, Adriene is as enthusiastic as her on-screen self – peppy yet sage, welcoming and warm. I mention this special alchemy that has fans talking about her as if she’s a friend. “Yeah, and we are,” she says immediately, as though she feels it too. “Whenever I meet people, I’m always like: ‘Holy shit, it’s such an honour – I get to be in people’s homes, their most vulnerable place.’” Her chat is peppered with talk of blessings and angels, but I would challenge even the most cynical-hearted not to want to get a second round of lattes in.She has a snort-out-loud sense of humour, with a confidence she attributes to a childhood raised by “creative hippies”.“Find what feels good” has been her motto ever since she started in 2012 – her followers recite it with almost evangelical fervour. This approach is part of what has drawn the numbers to her videos, and crowds to north London despite the £40 ticket price – as well as to the other stops on this European tour, which includes free classes. For Krohn, “Adriene was the first teacher who really got me to understand that yoga was about more than just physical flexibility or that kind of ego-driven thing that goes with modern yoga.” Bradley came to yoga because she has arthritis – Adriene has, she says, helped her find some acceptance: “This is where you are … you can still do things but don’t push it, find what you can do.”Practising at home has obvious advantages – people cite cheapness, struggling to get to a studio because of health issues and fitting quick sessions in around family life. Adriene’s focus is on accessibility yoga for all. You could question the altruism – as with any personality on YouTube, she earns revenue from her well-watched channel (the analytics firm Social Blade puts the brand’s annual earnings at up to £284,000). She has a sponsorship deal with Adidas, and  subscribers willing to pay $9.99 (£7.50) a month to access extra content on her Find What Feels Good site. But with millions of people able to access her yoga for free, I’ll get to critiques of her motivation once I’ve untangled from pigeon pose.Yoga is a booming industry – last year, the market was worth $80bn (£74bn) globally. Once a trailblazer, Adriene is now one of a host of online yoga teachers bringing an ancient practice to a mass, modern audience. “There are a lot of people who think it’s a little bit questionable,” she concedes. “I get why people from India are going: ‘Hey, what the hell are you doing?’” Cultural appropriation is a criticism she has seen levelled at a lot of American teachers and one that she thinks, to an extent, is fair. Has she ever been criticised herself? “I don’t actually get it that much and the only times I do, I can tell that person’s never done any of my videos. They’re lumping me in because I’m white, wearing Adidas pants.” She has, she says, “tried to teach the real traditional style yoga … I really want to honour the philosophy.”But that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been room for some online savvy. Her business partner, Chris Sharpe, who she met on the set of a horror film and who had previously produced the successful YouTube series Hilah Cooking, was aware of the need to push the videos up the search engine rankings. It made for knotty decisions. “I did not want to call anything ‘yoga for weight loss’ in the beginning,” she says. But they struck a deal and tried it: “It did so disgustingly well.”They started to play around and chose words they knew would rank highly. She cites a video called Six Pack Abs. “Is that what we abide by and are six-pack abs really possible for women? Nooooo. Anatomically, it’s just ridiculous. But I’m kind of making fun of it.” In the video, she begins in the persona of a dumbbell-bunny, before quickly caving: “Just kidding, if you know me at all I don’t really subscribe to that obsession.” If you’re not familiar with her shtick, you could be forgiven for thinking it a cynical move to get the ratings up. But she is no stranger to body-image issues herself, mentioning that before auditions, she has felt a pressure to diet.Even now, she says being “on YouTube, in tight clothing” means she has had to work hard to avoid feeling the same pressures. Instead, she says she wants to “get people closer to experiencing pure love and acceptance for themselves. She sees these video titles, antithetical to her message, as Trojan horses, bringing people to her channel so she can deliver her alternative: “You can look good all you want, but if you’re still looking in the mirror and not loving who you see, we have it backwards.” It might sound schmaltzy written down, but it is clearly a much-needed message.So why yoga, and why now? It is irresistible to link turbulent times with a practice that can help you feel grounded. I try to make it that neat: has she seen an uptick in numbers on her channels since Trump took office, say? “I don’t know how the numbers have changed in terms of big shifts in politics,” she says, “but I do know that as a woman and as a human living in this time, I feel it.” And she clearly wants her yoga to cut through. She weighs up the next words, almost egging herself on: “I want all the people who voted for Trump to do my yoga. I want all the people who battle with the experience of racism to do yoga.” There’s that yoga for all message again.Her mother is Mexican, and in recent years Adriene has been embracing her heritage more. “Not that I’ve ever tried to hide it – hell no,” she says. “But I wasn’t raised bilingual and I happen to be fair-skinned. Then I had a moment a couple of years ago when I was like: ‘Shoooot, I’m Mexican and nobody knows it.’” She is learning Spanish: “My goal is to be able to do a playlist on my channel that’s all yoga español.”Her brand’s meteoric rise has undoubtedly been helped by the boom in the global wellness industry – estimated in 2015 to be worth nearly $4tn – and Adriene knows it. “I’d be lying if I didn’t say Chris anticipated this … he had the idea of creating something in the world of wellness for a reason.”As for the recent politicisation of the wellness industry, especially in reaction to the more elitist side of it, “I just think that it’s like everything – it’s really not about what you’re putting out there, it’s about how you’re doing it. We’re saying we want everyone to feel good, and yet we’re insinuating the only way to do that is if you have enough money to buy this $65 detox tea, and then it comes in the mail and you’re like: ‘What the fuck, I could make this.’” It’s not something she’s immune to, either: “Hell yeah, I’ve Gooped.”Which is why, she says, she has started to care about the numbers – “It gives me more power to be, like, the people’s yogi.”Back in the hall of Ally Pally, we’re finishing the evening’s practice by hugging ourselves – yes, you read right. Adriene cracks a joke and then we’re all breathing in unison again, like one big, collective lung."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3539a5515d2efb371c2337c1a6616bd274ffa6/0_408_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39e00009d39219733b0ea1372b0dee81","title":"tom morello webchat","story":"The Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave and Prophets of Rage guitarist remains a political firebrand – and he’s here to answer your questions, liveHow complicated was it to make those guitar sounds back in 9192? Has technology made it easier now?When I decided I was the DJ in RATM, I began practising in a very non-traditional way. I would try to recreate sounds in my environment. From vacuum cleaners to helicopters to trips to the zoo, there was no sound that was ruled out in providing inspiration. And by attempting to cop the sound of a blender or a rhinoceros, it made me think of a guitar in a very different way. The electric guitar is a relatively new instrument on the planet and merely consists of a piece of woods, six wires and a few electronics, that can be manipulated in a myriad of ways, to create tonal stock that can be the building blocks of songs in a very non-traditional way. I have ignored all new technology. And continue to rely on the same grubby effects pedals I had in 1992, and my imagination, and innate stubbornness and creativity.On all of the RATM records, we wrote all sounds made by guitars, bass and drums, because you might mistake the curious noises therein for sampling, sequencing or DJ scratching. And it\u0027s been a badge of pride to continue that tradition of seeking out non-traditional sounds to make kick-ass rock\u0027n\u0027roll.Do you think there are fans of your music who are oblivious to your political message?Obviously there are fans of erse political persuasion that can get down with Rage, Audioslave, Prophets, the Nightwatchman or the Atlas Underground. THere\u0027s never been a political litmus test for enjoying this music. However, be careful, because you might learn something. I believe that inclusion, musically, can lead to education, politically. And I\u0027ve found that to be the case many times over. The message is in the moshpit. And in the Atlas Underground, the message is also on the dancefloor. While I never condone uniting with Nazis and racists, I recognise that people have different levels of political awareness, and that music can be an important introduction to ideas that go beyond those that are spoonfed in your home, school and via the media.I think it’s a shame this generation don’t have their own anthems like Killing in the Name, You Oughta Know, Fight the Power, Fuck the Police and Teen Spirit. Do you feel disheartened that the current zeitgeist isn’t producing such powerful music in the mainstream?Not so fast, sonny! Let me introduce you to the Atlas Underground, a sonic conspiracy of erse artists bent on stirring shit up at home and abroad. The mere existence of a group of collaborators of ergent genres, ergent ethnicities, ergent ages, and ergent genders, is a statement in and of itself for these times. However in addition to that, we are on a rebel music mission, telling social justice ghost stories to bring the heroes and martyrs of the past, the voices of the voiceless, into the struggles of today and to shine a beacon to illuminate a more just and humane future. You are welcome to join us in this endeavour. Rather than lamenting that there\u0027s no Killing in the Name or Smells Like Teen Spirit at the top of the charts, either dig a little deeper, or better, form your own band and write your Killing in the Name. We\u0027d love to hear it.Your bands have made some of the most energetic music I ever heard, energy that got me through high school, and also university, when I worked two jobs and hardly slept. But working towards political change for years can become exhausting, lots of activists get burned out. How do you maintain a positive outlook?Some suggest the world is actually a better place today than it ever has been. How do you respond? (See, for example, Oliver Burkeman, 28 July, or Steven Pinker feature by Andrew Anthony, 11 Feb)It is possible to get burned out engaging in the work of changing the world. But it is only via work that the world gets changed. I\u0027m committed to combining my convictions of a more just and humane society with my vocation of shredding my ass off. It is via music and the recognition that I am a link in a cultural chain of radical artists that use the weaponry of our instruments to confront injustice. The recognition that each of us, in our own place and time, can be an agent of change, is what motivates me. Those who have caused significant societal transformation had no more power, courage, intelligence or means than each of you reading this. But history is not waiting for you. You either grab the wheel, or let some other sons of bitches drive this planet into a ditch - the choice is yours.Beans on toast or egg on toast, you’ve got three seconds, which do you choose?Really. I flew six thousand miles to answer these questions. Really?An honest appraisal of your singing voice please Tom … ?I anticipate being victorious on the next X Factor with my six octave range, and rich, milk chocolate baritone timbre. What are you really getting at?I wheeze less than Dylan, and I have a broader vocabulary than Donovan. So I\u0027ll repeat, what are you really getting at?Favourite song of the year so far? Personally I’m loving, PHUK by OrbitalBlood in the Water by Grandson. Musically heavy and rocking lyrically inspiring and badass. I was so rocked by this song that I did my own remix of it.Given his theft of your name and IP for his ridiculous podcast, any chance you might ‘accidentally’ give Nigel Farage the dry slap he needs?I am open to accidentally giving Nigel a dry slap, if I encounter him on the tube. Though I doubt he rides the tube for fear of all the dry slaps he would receive. Regardless, that son of a bitch better stop using RATM as an underpinning for his racist diatribes, or we\u0027re coming for him. Warning issued!Your guest shows with Bruce Springsteen \u0026amp The E Street band were phenomenal, despite the way Bruce added unexpected songs into the set which would have thrown a lesser guitarist. Even so, were there any moments when you broke out in a cold sweat?Learning hundreds of songs in preparation for playing with the E Street Band was a challenge. I was constantly surprised by the random additions to the set nightly. While prior to playing with Bruce, this sort of intuitive-ness was not a part of my repertoire. It became a matter of learn fast or die trying. On our last US run, in 34 shows, we played 182 different songs, including one night where the first, the First, THE FIRST, THE FIRST SEVEN SONGS were songs the E Street Band had NEVER played before. And the eighth song was Jump by Van Halen. Boom! I\u0027ve got this one! I played the solo note for note. Let me describe the process. Bruce would take requests and gather signs from the audience. And then pluck one, face it stage right and left, and the amount of time you had to learn the song was during his 1,2,3,4 count off. And the song begins, ready or not. There were only a couple of occasions where I either totally flubbed, or secretly turned my volume off. And mimed along.- Do you smoke weed with B-Real?- How is your relationship with Zack de la Rocha? - What’s difference between touring with RATM and now?- Which country is your favourite?- Do you think RATM with Zack will ever come back? - Who did you learn to play guitar from? And what made u experiment with sounds so much?I have never smoked weed in my life. Though the second hand smoke that I ingest in the company of B-Real is astonishing. When Prophets of Rage are on tour and travelling between hotel and gig, we travel in two vehicles - one dubbed The Roasters\u0027 Van, in which B-Real presides, and one known as The Christian Bus, where Chuck D and I catch up on our reading. And talk baseball.I am a self taught guitar player. I took two lessons when I was 13 years old, hated them so much that I put the guitar in the closet for four years. I began playing at 17 because punk rock music made me realise I could do it too. I then began practising up to eight hours a day trying to ape my favourite shredders: Randy Rhoades, Steve Vai, Eddie Van Halen. After amassing considerable technique, I realised that I did not have my own voice on the instrument, and began practising the eccentricities in my playing. At the formation of RATM I had the revelation that I was the DJ in the band - and the blinders came off. I felt like there were no sonic boundaries to what I could explore on the guitar.Would RATM play a show in support of a second Brexit referendum......?? Right now we need “fists in the air in the land of hypocrisy”..... xxIf a Rage Against the Machine show breaks out, count me in...A plethora of artists have developed in your wake, my question is what current musicians do you regard as operating on the same wavelength? I would also love to get your opinion on Death Grips – would you be open to a collaboration?The artists that I\u0027ve been inspired by most recently have the same feel and heaviness and tension in their work of my favourite rock\u0027n\u0027roll, but they come from a different genre. Knife Party, Bassnectar, Skrillex - who I\u0027ve collaborated on my Atlas Underground album - all rock my in a very contemporary way. And inspire me to try and create a brand new genre of music, that pairs my Marshall stack fury with their electronic wizardry. PS the album is out October 12, but you can check out my collaborations with Knife Party and Bassnectar now, everywhere.Have you ever bumped into Bono? If so, what happened?I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve actually bumped into him, but I\u0027ve known him for a long time! It was U2\u0027s Joshua Tree and Unforgettable Fire cassettes that got me through my horrific work life when I first moved to Los Angeles, and probably saved me from entering the annals of white collar office mass murderers. I was an alphabetiser for the FDIC when they were transitioning from paper files to computers, so in the midst of eight hours of alphabetising a day, I clung to the thin hope that I might still be human in the uplifting tune-age of U2. Bono and my mum, who turns 95 in a couple of days, are also great friends and have a wonderfully interesting friendship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60571fc20d2518c54c83dff3c3f4522838471b43/0_454_2220_1331/master/2220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2dec33941445b5d01c8aa3165b34ab6","title":"may to petition iranian president over nazanin zaghari ratcliffe at un","story":"Chemical weapons and Brexit are other items high on PM’s agenda at general assemblyTheresa May is to petition Iran’s president for the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and call for greater efforts to curb chemical weapons at the UN general assembly in New York, a trip also expected to be punctuated by repeated questions about Brexit.May sets off for two days at the gathering of international leaders on Tuesday morning. A schedule released in advance by Downing Street shows that among those she will meet later that day is Hassan Rouhani.No 10 said the prime minister would raise the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman who has spent more than two years in jail in Iran accused of spying. May “will express serious concern at Nazanin’s ongoing detention and call for her to be released on humanitarian grounds”, a senior British government official said.May is also to hold talks with Donald Trump on Wednesday morning, before she makes her main speech to the assembly at the United Nations headquarters in New York, details of which have not been announced.She will also see the US president on Tuesday when he chairs a session of the UN security council on weapons proliferation. There, she is to warn about the use of chemical weapons, noting both attacks in Syria and the attack in Salisbury which the UK says was carried out by Russia.The focus on international diplomacy could be seen as a brief Brexit respite for May, between the humiliation of the rebuff from EU leaders in Salzburg over her Chequers plan, and what is likely to be a tempestuous Conservative party conference next week.May chaired a meeting of her cabinet a day earlier than usual on Monday, with the fate of the Chequers proposals expected to have been closely discussed.The subject will not, however, be absent in New York. The prime minister will update Trump on Brexit talks during their meeting, and again petition the sometimes capricious president over a swift trade deal between the UK and US.On Wednesday morning, she will expect to face questions on Brexit at a business forum organised by the Bloomberg news organisation, where she will meet its founder, the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and top executives from Google and drinks behemoth InBev, among others.At the security council meeting, May will warn that the chemical weapons attacks in Ghouta, Syria, and the use of the novichok nerve agent in Salisbury show “the red lines around the use of chemical weapons are being eroded”.In comments released by Downing Street before the trip, May said: “Attacks such as Salisbury and Ghouta are despicable in their own right, but they are also a threat to the wider international system.“Each time we fail to challenge the use or development of weapons of mass destruction, it erodes the framework of treaties we have built up so painstakingly over the past few decades.”While praising the international response against Russia over the Salisbury attack, May said the international community needed to do more, “both to prevent future chemical weapons use and to ensure those who use them are held to account, but also to tackle the range of other threats to global security, including the proliferation of WMD”.In other engagements at the UN, May will host an event on girls’ education worldwide alongside France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.She will also and speak alongside President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, as well as the Microsoft founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates, about employment in Africa.She is scheduled to have more bilateral meetings with other leaders, details of which have yet to be confirmed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c49b1f4791a7522aa4fecd20ce3c29fb098c3a94/0_1181_5901_3542/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b88ebb8e406fe894c1fad631f1c96954","title":"about time why western philosophy can only teach us so much","story":"By gaining greater knowledge of how others think, we can become less certain of the knowledge we think we have, which is always the first step to greater understanding. By  Julian BagginiOne of the great unexplained wonders of human history is that written philosophy first flowered entirely separately in different parts of the globe at more or less the same time. The origins of Indian, Chinese and ancient Greek philosophy, as well as Buddhism, can all be traced back to a period of roughly 300 years, beginning in the 8th century BC.These early philosophies have shaped the different ways people worship, live and think about the big questions that concern us all. Most people do not consciously articulate the philosophical assumptions they have absorbed and are often not even aware that they have any, but assumptions about the nature of self, ethics, sources of knowledge and the goals of life are deeply embedded in our cultures and frame our thinking without our being aware of them.Yet, for all the varied and rich philosophical traditions across the world, the western philosophy I have studied for more than 30 years – based entirely on canonical western texts – is presented as the universal philosophy, the ultimate inquiry into human understanding. Comparative philosophy – study in two or more philosophical traditions – is left almost entirely to people working in anthropology or cultural studies. This abdication of interest assumes that comparative philosophy might help us to understand the intellectual cultures of India, China or the Muslim world, but not the human condition.This has become something of an embarrassment for me. Until a few years ago, I knew virtually nothing about anything other than western philosophy, a tradition that stretches from the ancient Greeks to the great universities of Europe and the US. Yet, if you look at my PhD certificate or the names of the university departments where I studied, there is only one, unqualified, word: philosophy. Recently and belatedly, I have been exploring the great classical philosophies of the rest of the world, travelling across continents to encounter them first-hand. It has been the most rewarding intellectual journey of my life.My philosophical journey has convinced me that we cannot understand ourselves if we do not understand others. Getting to know others requires avoiding the twin dangers of overestimating either how much we have in common or how much ides us. Our shared humanity and the perennial problems of life mean that we can always learn from and identify with the thoughts and practices of others, no matter how alien they might at first appear. At the same time, differences in ways of thinking can be both deep and subtle. If we assume too readily that we can see things from others’ points of view, we end up seeing them from merely a variation of our own.To travel around the world’s philosophies is an opportunity to challenge the beliefs and ways of thinking we take for granted. By gaining greater knowledge of how others think, we can become less certain of the knowledge we think we have, which is always the first step to greater understanding.Take the example of time. Around the world today, time is linear, ordered into past, present and future. Our days are organised by the progression of the clock, in the short to medium term by calendars and diaries, history by timelines stretching back over millennia. All cultures have a sense of past, present and future, but for much of human history this has been underpinned by a more fundamental sense of time as cyclical. The past is also the future, the future is also the past, the beginning also the end.The dominance of linear time fits in with an eschatological worldview in which all of human history is building up to a final judgment. This is perhaps why, over time, it became the common-sense way of viewing time in the largely Christian west. When God created the world, he began a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. As Revelation puts it, while prophesying the end times, Jesus is this epic’s “Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last”.But there are other ways of thinking about time. Many schools of thought believe that the beginning and the end are and have always been the same because time is essentially cyclical. This is the most intuitively plausible way of thinking about eternity. When we imagine time as a line, we end up baffled: what happened before time began? How can a line go on without end? A circle allows us to visualise going backwards or forwards for ever, at no point coming up against an ultimate beginning or end.Thinking of time cyclically especially made sense in premodern societies, where there were few innovations across generations and people lived very similar lives to those of their grandparents, their great-grandparents and going back many generations. Without change, progress was unimaginable. Meaning could therefore only be found in embracing the cycle of life and death and playing your part in it as best you could.East Asian philosophy is deeply rooted in the cycle of the seasons, part of a larger cycle of existence. This is particularly evident in Taoism, and is vividly illustrated by the surprising cheerfulness of the 4th century BC Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when everyone thought he should have been mourning for his wife. At first, he explained, he was as miserable as anyone else. Then he thought back beyond her to the beginning of time itself: “In all the mixed-up bustle and confusion, something changed and there was qi. The qi changed and there was form. The form changed and she had life. Today there was another change and she died. It’s just like the round of four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter.”In Chinese thought, wisdom and truth are timeless, and we do not need to go forward to learn, only to hold on to what we already have. As the 19th- century Scottish sinologist James Legge put it, Confucius did not think his purpose was “to announce any new truths, or to initiate any new economy. It was to prevent what had previously been known from being lost.” Mencius, similarly, criticised the princes of his day because “they do not put into practice the ways of the ancient kings”. Mencius also says, in the penultimate chapter of the eponymous collection of his conversations, close to the book’s conclusion: “The superior man seeks simply to bring back the unchanging standard, and, that being correct, the masses are roused to virtue.” The very last chapter charts the ages between the great kings and sages.A hybrid of cyclical and linear time operates in strands of Islamic thought. “The Islamic conception of time is based essentially on the cyclic rejuvenation of human history through the appearance of various prophets,” says Seyyed Hossein Nasr, professor emeritus of Islamic studies at George Washington University. Each cycle, however, also moves humanity forward, with each revelation building on the former – the dictation of the Qur’an to Muhammad being the last, complete testimony of God – until ultimately the series of cycles ends with the appearance of the Mahdi, who rules for 40 years before the final judgment.The distinction between linear and cyclical time is therefore not always neat. The assumption of an eitheror leads many to assume that oral philosophical traditions have straightforwardly cyclical conceptions of time. The reality is more complicated. Take Indigenous Australian philosophies. There is no single Australian first people with a shared culture, but there are enough similarities across the country for some tentative generalisations to be made about ideas that are common or dominant. The late anthropologist David Maybury-Lewis suggested that time in Indigenous Australian culture is neither cyclical nor linear instead, it resembles the space-time of modern physics. Time is intimately linked to place in what he calls the “dreamtime” of “past, present, future all present in this place”.“One lives in a place more than in a time,” is how Stephen Muecke puts it in his book Ancient and Modern: Time, Culture and Indigenous Philosophy. More important than the distinction between linear or cyclical time is whether time is separated from or intimately connected to place. Take, for example, how we conceive of death. In the contemporary west, death is primarily seen as the expiration of the inidual, with the body as the locus, and the location of that body irrelevant. In contrast, Muecke says: “Many indigenous accounts of the death of an inidual are not so much about bodily death as about a return of energy to the place of emanation with which it re-identifies.”Such a way of thinking is especially alien to the modern west, where a pursuit of objectivity systematically downplays the particular, the specifically located. In a provocative and evocative sentence, Muecke says: “Let me suggest that longsightedness is a European form of philosophical myopia and that other versions of philosophy, indigenous perhaps, have a more lived-in and intimate association with societies of people and the way they talk about themselves.”Muecke cites the Australian academic Tony Swain’s view that the concept of linear time is a kind of fall from place. “I’ve got a hunch that modern physics separated out those dimensions and worked on them, and so we produced time as we know it through a whole lot of experimental and theoretical activities,” Muecke told me. “If you’re not conceptually and experimentally separating those dimensions, then they would tend to flow together.” His indigenous friends talk less of time or place independently, but more of located events. The key temporal question is not “When did this happen?” but “How is this related to other events?”That word related is important. Time and space have become theoretical abstractions in modern physics, but in human culture they are concrete realities. Nothing exists purely as a point on a map or a moment in time: everything stands in relation to everything else. So to understand time and space in oral philosophical traditions, we have to see them less as abstract concepts in metaphysical theories and more as living conceptions, part and parcel of a broader way of understanding the world, one that is rooted in relatedness. Hirini Kaa, a lecturer at the University of Auckland, says that “the key underpinning of Maori thought is kinship, the connectedness between humanity, between one another, between the natural environment”. He sees this as a form of spirituality. “The ocean wasn’t just water, it wasn’t something for us to be afraid of or to utilise as a commodity, but became an ancestor deity, Tangaroa. Every living thing has a life force.”This should be clear enough. But the tradition of western philosophy, in particular, has striven for a universality that glosses over differences of time and place. The word “university”, for example, even shares the same etymological root as “universal”. In such institutions, “the pursuit of truth recognises no national boundaries”, as one commentator observed. Place is so unimportant in western philosophy that, when I discovered it was the theme of the quinquennial East-West Philosophers’ Conference in 2016, I wondered if there was anything I could bring to the party at all. (I decided that the absence of place in western philosophy itself merited consideration.)The universalist thrust has many merits. The refusal to accept any and every practice as a legitimate custom has bred a very good form of intolerance for the barbaric and unjust traditional practices of the west itself. Without this intolerance, we would still have slavery, torture, fewer rights for women and homosexuals, feudal lords and unelected parliaments. The universalist aspiration has, at its best, helped the west to transcend its own prejudices. At the same time, it has also legitimised some prejudices by confusing them with universal truths. The philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah argues that the complaints of anti-universalists are not generally about universalism at all, but pseudo-universalism, “Eurocentric hegemony posing as universalism”. When this happens, intolerance for the indefensible becomes intolerance for anything that is different. The aspiration for the universal becomes a crude insistence on the uniform. Sensitivity is lost to the very different needs of different cultures at different times and places.This “posing as universalism” is widespread and often implicit, with western concepts being taken as universal but Indian ones remaining Indian, Chinese remaining Chinese, and so on. To end this pretence, Jay L Garfield and Bryan W Van Norden propose that those departments of philosophy that refuse to teach anything from non-western traditions at least have the decency to call themselves departments of western philosophy.The “pattern thinking” of Maori and Indigenous Australian philosophies could provide a corrective to the assumption that our values are the universal ones and that others are aberrations. It makes credible and comprehensible the idea that philosophy is never placeless and that thinking that is uprooted from any land soon withers and dies.Mistrust of the universalist aspiration, however, can go too far. At the very least, there is a contradiction in saying there are no universal truths, since that is itself a universal claim about the nature of truth. The right view probably lies somewhere between the claims of naive universalists and those of defiant localists. There seems to be a sense in which even the universalist aspiration has to be rooted in something more particular. TS Eliot is supposed to have said: “Although it is only too easy for a writer to be local without being universal, I doubt whether a poet or novelist can be universal without being local, too.” To be purely universal is to inhabit an abstract universe too detached from the real world. But just as a novelist can touch on universals of the human condition through the particulars of a couple of characters and a specific story, so our different, regional philosophical traditions can shed light on more universal philosophical truths even though they approach them from their own specific angles.We should not be afraid to ground ourselves in our own traditions, but we should not be bound by them. Gandhi put this poetically when he wrote: “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any. I refuse to live in other people’s houses as an interloper, a beggar or a slave.”In the west, the predominance of linear time is associated with the idea of progress that reached its apotheosis in the Enlightenment. Before this, argues the philosopher Anthony Kenny, “people looking for ideals had looked backwards in time, whether to the primitive church, or to classical antiquity, or to some mythical prelapsarian era. It was a key doctrine of the Enlightenment that the human race, so far from falling from some earlier eminence, was moving forward to a happier future.”Kenny is expressing a popular view, but many see the roots of belief in progress deeper in the Christian eschatological religious worldview. “Belief in progress is a relic of the Christian view of history as a universal narrative,” claims John Gray. Secular thinkers, he says, “reject the idea of providence, but they continue to think humankind is moving towards a universal goal”, even though “the idea of progress in history is a myth created by the need for meaning”.Whether faith in progress is an invention or an adaptation of the Enlightenment, the image of secular humanists naively believing humanity is on an irreversible, linear path of advancement seems to me a caricature of their more modest hope, based in history, that progress has occurred and that more is possible. As the historian Jonathan Israel says, Enlightenment ideas of progress “were usually tempered by a strong streak of pessimism, a sense of the dangers and challenges to which the human condition is subject”. He dismisses the idea that “Enlightenment thinkers nurtured a naive belief in man’s perfectibility” as a “complete myth conjured up by early 20th-century scholars unsympathetic to its claims”.Nevertheless, Gray is right to point out that linear progress is a kind of default way of thinking about history in the modern west and that this risks blinding us to the ways in which gains can be lost, advances reversed. It also fosters a sense of the superiority of the present age over earlier, supposedly less “advanced” times. Finally, it occludes the extent to which history doesn’t repeat itself but does rhyme.The different ways in which philosophical traditions have conceived time turn out to be far from mere metaphysical curiosities. They shape the way we think about both our temporal place in history and our relation to the physical places in which we live. It provides one of the easiest and clearest examples of how borrowing another way of thinking can bring a fresh perspective to our world. Sometimes, simply by changing the frame, the whole picture can look very different.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.This is an edited extract from How the World Thinks: A Global History of Philosophy, published by Granta on 4 October.

I don’t think it is going to meet our tests and we shouldn’t be voting for a deal which we don’t think is in the national interest.”In a speech to Labour’s conference in Liverpool on Tuesday, Starmer will formalise the party’s resolve to try to scupper any agreement that amounts to a “blind Brexit”. He will say: “If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests – and that looks increasingly likely – Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.”On Today, Starmer rejected May’s argument that the alternative to the deal she hoped to secure would be leaving the EU without a deal. He said: “We cannot carry on with this idea that the prime minister can bring back any deal that she cobbles together and we must all vote for it however awful it is, because something even worse will happen.“That’s not a meaningful vote. There has to be a point where parliament says it is not good enough, and I don’t think there’s a majority in parliament for no deal. I don’t think no deal is the consequence. That’s why we are putting other options on the table.”In a series of morning interviews, Starmer again insisted the Labour leadership was united on the possibility of a second referendum and whether it would include an option to remain.Delegates at the party’s conference in Liverpool are expected to back a plan that could lead to a fresh public vote that could include the option of ditching Brexit altogether. Starmer, who said he would vote to stay in the EU if that was an option, played down the isions at the top of the party over the plan.Under the terms of the motion to be voted on at the conference on Tuesday, if Labour cannot force an early general election it will “support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote”. Starmer said the scope of the motion was “wide enough to encompass the option of remain” in any referendum.On BBC Breakfast, he was played a clip of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on Monday saying Labour would respect the original referendum and any subsequent vote would only be on the terms of the deal.Starmer pointed out that McDonnell later clarified that voting to remain could still be on any second vote. He said: “John later in the day said: ‘Yes, all options are on the table’. So there isn’t this difference between me and John McDonnell. The whole Labour party is united around the motion that is going forward this morning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a758611f9febefe6ae153bf7e2c73e54e99a6a59/231_364_3162_1898/master/3162.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c28d871b9df0849772aac0f7d83e3a52","title":"labour conference brexit debate starmer increasingly likely to vote down mays brexit deal starmer says politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the Labour conference in Liverpool, including the debate on Brexit and a second referendumRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was the final speaker in the conference hall this morning. She had two announcements to make.Thriving high streets were once the centre of communities, somewhere local people were proud of but once flourishing businesses are now replaced by boarded-up shops with almost 25,000 vacant retail and leisure premises across Great Britain. Household names such as Toys R Us and Maplin have disappeared and big brands like New Look and M\u0026ampS are closing stores across the country.The move to online retail and the changing nature of the way we shop doesn’t need to mean empty high streets and job losses. It can mean a vibrant community space, with local independent shops, cafes and restaurants.But that will require governmental action to reinvigorate our high streets ..Today I am announcing Labour’s emergency 5-point plan to save Britain’s high streets.The next Labour government will ban ATM charges and stop Post Office and bank branch closures.We will provide free bus travel for under 25s.Deliver free public Wi-Fi in town centres.Establish a register of landlords of empty shops in each local authority.And finally, on one of the most pressing issues, business rates we will introduce annual revaluations of rates, exempt new plant and machinery from revaluations, ensure a fair appeals system and fundamentally review the business rates system to bring it into the 21st century.Long-Bailey stressed that these were measures that could be introduced immediately. The party was also working on long-term measures to address the problem, she said. The truth is the Tories are off track to meet our current targets.We acknowledge that the UK needs to do much more to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C. So today I state firmly that a Labour government will back a target for net zero emissions by 2050.My colleague Adam Vaughan has more on this here.My colleague Martin Kettle has written a good column about the Keir Starmer speech. Here is an extract.“Nobody,” said Starmer, “is ruling out remain as an option.” The response in the hall to that was immediate. First an instant volley of applause, but then, from deeper in the hall, and somehow also from somewhere deeper in the gut of the party conference, came the cheering, prolonged and surging, and then the standing ovation.It was a powerful moment. As someone who has been reporting party conferences for a very long time, I can’t remember all that many like it in any party. It’s rare for a politician, even addressing their supporters, to hit the spot with something truly unexpected and powerful. But Starmer’s embrace of the possibility of remaining in the EU hit that spot unerringly. It was, it seems, an improvised addition to the speech. The words weren’t in the planned text. But the words mattered – and so did the response in the hall. Most were on the feet. The applause went on and on. This was, it suddenly felt, a Labour party that really is up for a fight to preserve Britain’s place in Europe.And here is the full article.A colleague who was in the hall says David Mallon, the speaker who said he was opposed to a referendum and who described the EU as a “capitalists’ club”, was embraced by Jeremy Corbyn as he left the stage. (See 12.38pm.) Mallon got quite emotional towards the end of his speech, and my colleague says it might have been a comfort hug, rather than an indication that Corbyn agreed with every word. But still ...Bruce Hogan, a councillor from the Forest of Dean, says having another referendum would not be anti-democratic. Hundreds of thousands of people have changed their mind, he says. He says they realise the leave campaign told lies.And that’s the last speech in the morning debate. But there will be more time for debate this afternoon, before the vote, the conference chair says.David Mallon, a delegate from Blyth Valley, is the first speaker to come out clearly against a people’s vote. He says delegates should remember what people feel about this in places like Blyth Valley. He says he is now against the EU because he sees it as a “capitalists’ club”. The EU has used free trade to take advantage of workers in Eastern Europe. But he is not anti-European, he says. He is a third-generation refugee from Poland. His family were expelled from Poland after the war because they were German nationals.He says Labour should push for a general election instead.Steve Turner, the Unite assistant general secretary, says many trade unionists did vote for Brexit. They feel left behind, in communities battered by austerity. “A perfect storm” has ided the nation. It is Labour’s job to step up, and get access to the single market and customs union membership.He says a vote on the deal would not be a second referendum. Despite what Keir Starmer said earlier, it would be a public vote on the terms of departure, he says.Turner seems to be channelling the views of his boss, the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey.He gets a decent round of applause, but it is not as loud as the applause the more anti-Brexit speakers have been getting.Bryn Jones, from Bath, is speaking now. He says he wants to urge some points of “caution” about a second referendum.First, the Tories would be able to choose the wording. They could slant it, he suggests.Second, if there were to be a Brexit, the consequences for Labour could be dangerous. A close result could continue the split in the country and the party. So the leadership should think carefully. He says:What we want is not a referendum, not a people’s vote, because that does not give us the opportunity to put in place our policies.The priority must be an election, he says.And a Ukip press release has just arrived in my inbox, and it’s almost identical to Labour Leave’s. (See 12.18pm.) Referring to Keir Starmer’s speech, the Ukip leader Gerard Batten said:Keir Starmer is another member of the remainer elite who thinks he knows better than the people. I will remind Mr Starmer that five million Labour voters also voted for Brexit.Labour, Liberal or Tory, it’s clear that if people want Brexit then they will have to vote for UKIP at the next general election.Labour Leave has described Keir Starmer’s speech this morning as a challenge to Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership and a betrayal of millions of Labour voters. In a statement its general secretary, Brendan Chilton, said:This is a betrayal of the very highest order. It is a betrayal not only of the millions of Labour voters, but of our 2017 manifesto.It is a betrayal that voters will remember for a very long time, and we will lose MPs as a result. There is no doubt. It was a P45 to our MPs in the Midlands and Wales.But let me be clear on another thing: Keir’s speech today was a challenge to Jeremy’s leadership. It was a carefully calculated pitch, no doubt written with a team of advisers. He is undermining Jeremy, John McDonnell and millions of Labour voters -- and he knows it.Tosh McDonald, Aslef’s president, has just finished speaking. He described how much he hated Margaret Thatcher. Jeremy Corbyn may be above hate, he said, but he wasn’t. He said he hated Thatcher every hour of the day, and used to set his alarm clock so he could get up early because he wanted to have an extra hour a day hating her.UPDATE: Here’s the quote.I hated her. I wish I could be like Jeremy and rise above it but I can’t... I did set my alarm clock an hour earlier than I needed just so I could hate her for an hour longer. Since she died I don’t do that anymore, I just set my alarm at the right time, but I still wake up an hour earlier - I can’t help it.On the subject of the compositing meeting, the Independent’s Joe Watts has written an excellent feature describing in detail what happened at that meeting, and how a deal was struck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/572970543aba827ac64627062b99748b71c0abfa/0_20_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c32bc11230942d22ea0b0a370e87e3d4","title":"improvement uk life expectancy stalled ons figures show","story":"Office for National Statistics says growth in life expectancy is lowest since records beganGrowth in life expectancy in the UK has come to a halt, and in some areas decreased, figures show.The statistics represent the lowest improvement in life expectancy since records began and puts the UK behind other leading economies.Public health experts have blamed care failings and cuts to social services, while charities described the findings as “deeply depressing” and called for extra investment into Britain’s care system.The revelation comes after Jeremy Hunt, then the health secretary, announced that the green paper on the long-awaited reform of care and support of older people in England had been delayed again until the autumn. The paper and a review of funding and reform, originally scheduled to be published last year, is due for implementation in 2020.A girl born in England between 2015 and 2017 is expected to live until 82.9 years old, which is no change on the previous figure for 2014 to 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figure for baby boys born in England in 2015 to 2017 is also unchanged, at 79.2 years.But for males and females in Scotland and Wales, life expectancy has declined by 0.1 years, with males in Northern Ireland seeing a similar fall.Sophie Sanders, of the ONS Centre for Ageing and Demography, said the figures represented “the lowest improvements in life expectancy since the start of the series in 1980 to 1982”.“This slowing in improvements is reflected in the chances of surviving to age 90 years from birth, which has also seen virtually no improvement since 2012 to 2014,” she added.Sir Steve Webb, a former Liberal Democrat pensions minister and director of policy at Royal London, said: “The UK has slumped from being one of the strongest performers when it comes to improving life expectancy to bottom of the league. There is a real human cost behind these statistics and we urgently need to understand more about why this is happening.”He added: “The government needs to conduct urgent research into these worrying trends. If other countries can ride out the economic storms and continue to drive up life expectancy, there is no reason why the UK should not be able to do so.”But while growth in life expectancy at age 90 has stalled, as have the chances of surviving from birth to age 90, the number of people aged 90 and over is still increasing. This is because of previous improvements in mortality going back many decades, which have resulted in an increasing proportion, and number, of people reaching 90 years over time.The number of centenarians in the UK was slightly lower in 2017 than it was in 2016 – down to 14,430 from 14,510. This corresponds with low numbers of births during the first world war. The number of centenarians is expected to decrease further in 2018 before increasing again from 2019, in line with the pattern shown 10 years earlier for those aged 90 years and over.Jane Ashcroft, the chief executive of Anchor, England’s largest not-for-profit provider of care and housing for older people, said the figures strengthened calls for a dedicated minister for old people.“It’s fantastic to hear that so many of us are now living into our 90s in the UK but we must not forget that with an ageing population comes greater responsibility to cater for our older people living well into retirement,” she said. “As the figures increase, government must step up to ensure good social care, housing and healthcare remains a priority for older people – who all too often fall through the cracks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a47ff9921c7ea48a366e928cf5f9afe69c1e8149/0_61_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dab908bb51f3b81ba571bb1d26f5ddd6","title":"rory mcilroy majors ryder cup 2018 golf","story":"Rory McIlroy the Ryder Cup years. It is difficult to know where to start. Even for an inidual with such propensity to generate column inches, the sense of drama attached to McIlroy at the biennial meeting of Europe and the United States is eye-catching.This is the event a young McIlroy once disregarded as “an exhibition”, at which he first encountered his now wife, Erica, amid a crazy car dash to make a Medinah tee time and where he played a match for the ages against Patrick Reed. Over three days at Hazeltine two years ago, and culminating in that epic duel with Reed, McIlroy admitted boorish galleries and a scene more akin to a football match gave him a headache.The piecing of such events together draws a McIlroy smile. What next, one wonders, as the Ryder Cup circus pulls into Le Golf National? “I have never really thought about it in that way, what the Ryder Cup has meant to me,” he admits. “From an event I didn’t really get, then you are a part of it and realise you are playing for something bigger than yourself. We don’t get to do much of that. It means something else.“I can’t believe this is going to be my fifth one. It goes so quickly. My proudest moments in golf have definitely been my major championships but my best experiences, by far, have been Ryder Cups. It’s the most fun I have had playing in a golf tournament. That started at Celtic Manor in 2010 and has not wavered the whole way through.”At Hazeltine, McIlroy was the beating pulse of a European side which fell to comprehensive 17-11 defeat. Partisan crowds identified that McIlroy was subject to constant heckling. By the time he faced Reed on the Sunday the atmosphere pushed – or broke – golfing boundaries. McIlroy’s demeanour changed as never before. “I look back at it and I think to myself that I know why I was so exhausted at the end of the week,” McIlroy says. “I know why I hit a wall midway through that match on Sunday.“I think with you having the crowd on your side, you don’t have to be as boisterous and there won’t be the fever pitch element to it. Because it’s France, because it’s Europe, I don’t think it will be like that anyway. If I have to be dragged into something like that again, I’m more than happy to do it but I’d like it to be a little less stressful. I don’t think you should be put in a position on a golf course where that’s your reaction to holing a putt or your reaction to hitting a good shot.“Erica made a good analogy the other day she said it’s like putting a dog in a cage that doesn’t want to be there and then prodding it with something for a day. Sooner or later, it’s going to chew its way or do something to get out of that cage because it is going mad. That’s kind of how it felt at that Ryder Cup, it was such a cauldron. Those bursts of emotion just built up over a few days.”McIlroy partnered Tiger Woods in Atlanta on Sunday, thereby being afforded a close-up view of the 42-year-old’s latest and arguably most significant triumph. As a self-confessed Woods “geek” in his formative years, it is little surprise McIlroy would relish an opportunity to battle directly with golf’s returning hero in a Ryder Cup environment. That it wasn’t a boyhood dream doesn’t prevent an adult ambition.“When I was young, I dreamt about the majors. I had a very different view of the Ryder Cup until I actually played in one. Everyone knows what I said. So I dreamt of playing Tiger but not in Ryder Cups head to head in a major.“It would be unbelievable this time. It will be a strange one because so many people there will be pro-Europe but everyone knows what he means to golf. He will get more support in France from everyone than any of the other US team members will, which is a strange phenomenon but shows what he has meant to the game.”By virtue of McIlroy’s very nature, plus his standard professional domain being across the Atlantic, he will have as many friends on the US team this weekend as among his fellow European players. Don’t dare suggest, though, that a Ryder Cup defeat cannot sting. “I think the toughest thing is looking at the other team celebrating. You want to be them. I hadn’t had that experience until last time and it is the toughest thing about it. Whenever you are on a team and that collective isn’t the one celebrating, spraying champagne? It’s not a nice feeling.”Of unquestionable benefit to Thomas Bjørn and Europe is that McIlroy is displaying traces of his best as the 2018 season draws to a close. The bad, moreover, can be far less damaging in a matchplay environment. The 29-year-old is, however, typically candid when assessing whether glory in this team dynamic can in any way offset his failure to add to a major haul of four this year.“I don’t know … I could go and win all five of my matches and we don’t win the Ryder Cup and I’m sure I’ll wake up on Monday morning not feeling very good,” McIlroy says.“At the end of the day I’m going to look back at my time at Ryder Cups, at my experiences, but I’ll always look back results-wise at what I’ve done as an inidual. Winning the Ryder Cup this year would be awesome, if I am able to contribute to the team then even better. Would it make up for not winning at Carnoustie, for not giving it a better go at Augusta? No.”McIlroy will make history on Friday by becoming the first golfer to win a quartet of majors and play in five Ryder Cups before the age of 30. History tells us the milestone will be met with fireworks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79b5fa0fb49f4b096641ff958a1aa45d54c167ab/0_206_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0ae9ff57dcecbca7ef35b9c6bd9647e","title":"underarm bowling the spin cricket","story":"It has not been seen regularly in a first-class game for almost 100 years but there was a time when ‘lob’ bowling was highly successful and used to humiliate batsmen into getting outThere is a particularly interesting episode of Revisionist History, Malcolm Gladwell’s often fascinating podcast, about Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point game in the NBA and the importance in achieving that historic record of underhand free throws.The reason for his decision was simple: the underhand method is widely and pejoratively known as a “granny shot”, seen as being the lame recourse of those not skilled enough to throw properly. “I felt silly, like a sissy, shooting underhanded,” Chamberlain wrote in his autobiography. “I know I was wrong. I know some of the best foul shooters in history shot that way. I just couldn’t do it.”In my early childhood games of cricket almost every player had a go at bowling, falling into one of three groups. There were those whose only hope of vaguely threatening the stumps was to bowl underarm, the youthful prodigies who could reliably sling down vaguely accurate overarm deliveries, and the most hapless bunch of them all, those whose ability was no better than the first group but who bowled overarm anyway. These were children who, for fear of making themselves look silly, made themselves look silly.Neville Cardus, the ’s venerable cricket writer and an advocate of underarm, or lob, bowling, addressed the issue of the style’s lack of credibility after the death of Sussex’s brilliant Walter Humphreys in 1924. “No doubt the man in the street will smile at the mere mention of lobs. ‘Grubs’, he calls them derisively,” he wrote. “But surely the success of Humphreys’ modest art, at a period great in batsmanship, cannot be dismissed with a smile of indulgence.”Humphreys also helped George Simpson-Hayward, probably the greatest “modern” lob bowler, or lobster as they became known, to hone his art. He spent three years practicing lobs before he first used them in a match, with instant success. Pelham Warner reported that when he made his England debut in South Africa in 1910 “the crowd roared with laughter when he first went on”. He took six wickets for 42 runs.The derision with which lob bowling was met was perhaps, Cardus wrote, actually an advantage, helping to tempt batsmen out of dull defensiveness. “A batsman cannot stonewall for long against a lob bowler without feeling, down in his heart, that he is making a fool of himself,” he wrote.But there was more to lob bowling than attempting to humiliate batsmen into getting themselves out. Underarm bowling is inherently more accurate – “the quoit player does not trust an overarm action,” as Cardus notes – and allows greater and more varied spin to be applied to the ball. Plus by the 1920s lob bowling was so unusual that opponents no longer knew how best to play it. As Cardus saw it, “every county ought to encourage a likely lob bowler just because every other county doesn’t”.It is also possible to bowl underarm and at pace. David Harris was the fastest bowler of his day (though his day was in the late 18th Century) Brighton’s George Brown, a tree-trunk-limbed father of 17 who played a century later, was so quick his teams had to deploy two long stops. According to legend on one occasion they both missed the ball, which even when it reached the boundary was going so fast that it struck and instantly killed a passing dog.“We are all too apt to make of our pastimes pretty routine affairs, with too much hard professionalism spoiling the surprise and gusto which are the life and soul of sport,” Cardus opined in 1919. “Let us have back the lob then, and the batsman on his toes, the men in the outfield keen and palpitating just a little, the crowd buzzing anticipation.”The world of cricket did not heed the cry. Indeed two years later when Trevor Molony made the first of three appearances for Surrey – taking the wicket of Jack Hobbs in a trial game – the  noted that “lobs are such an unfamiliar sight in these days that his efforts were watched with much interest” (according to the Cricketer on one occasion the batters’ discomfort at his bowling “evinced much laughter from the crowd”). Approaching a century later Molony remains the last specialist lob bowler to play first class cricket.“If we try to discover some explanation for the present universal neglect of lob bowling, we shall probably be right in suggesting as the first and greatest, fashion,” the  wrote in 1931. “It does now require some moral courage for a boy to begin and continue bowling lobs in a society which regards them as a slightly fatuous jest.”Would a great lobster have any chance of thriving in today’s game? It is impossible to say, as nobody alive has ever seen one, and it is unlikely now that they ever shall. The accuracy and unpredictability of Simpson-Hayward represent a test that can only be faced in the imagination. But, and this is the crux, did it die out because it was considered inferior, or because it was considered infantile?• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

As outlined to the  a fortnight ago, World Rugby’s vice-chairman Agustín Pichot believes significant change is required for the global game to flourish financially and his proposed solution will be debated in Sydney this Wednesday. Should he gain sufficient support, it will spell the end of the traditional matrix of June and November tour fixtures.Pichot and his supporters want to see a new “World League” run along similar lines to European football’s new Nations League, rather than the current succession of (so-called) “friendlies”. The top 12 sides in the world rankings would be split into pools potentially hosted in alternate years by the northern and southern hemispheres, with three pool games for each team, followed by semi-finals and a final. Five huge weekends in total, with shared television rights, would lend an extra “edge” (to use Pichot’s word) to some previously mundane fixtures.Would it benefit the game? From a purely rugby perspective the answer is potentially yes. The current June and November Tests tend to involve at least one team staggering towards the end of a long season: by unifying the “windows” into one block, it would help to level the playing field. There would also be a collective narrative for everyone else to follow, replacing the “here today gone tomorrow” disposability of one-off autumn Tests. Rather than undermining the Rugby World Cup, it might just achieve the opposite and whet the public’s appetite to a greater extent. Less is frequently more in top-level sport.In terms of revenue sharing, it might also help the have-nots. Current international attendances in the southern hemisphere are sliding and there will be certain subscription-based television companies interested in the potential of a fresh full-on tournament with worldwide appeal. Good luck, though, with convincing Premiership Rugby or the Rugby Football Union that this constitutes progress. The English clubs have assorted plans of their own, none of which involve obediently picking up crumbs from the major unions’ schedules. The RFU makes so many millions from big Twickenham occasions that reducing the number of said paydays would involve an entire farmyard of self-interested turkeys voting for Christmas.As Pichot stressed this month, however, rugby can no longer afford selfishness and old-school thinking if it wishes to maximise its full potential. The Six Nations and Rugby Championship competitions would remain intact but a new, streamlined proposition would join them. Assuming a satisfactory revenue-sharing model can be agreed, it would generate more cash for World Rugby’s collective coffers and help emerging nations to emerge a bit quicker. Tonga, Fiji, Japan and others would no longer be fobbed off with the occasional Test abroad. They would be an integral part of the show.This, in turn, would galvanise the nations ranked 13th and below presumably there would also be regional shoot-outs with the winners earning sufficient ranking points to break into the top dozen – or qualify for a play-off – the following year. It might also help players welfare-wise: international players would play fewer Tests overall but the commercial spin-offs could be substantial.Assuming room in the calendar is retained for a British and Irish Lions tour every four years, Pichot’s initiative merits serious consideration, notwithstanding the San Francisco compromise agreement to which all the stakeholders signed up last year. The International Rugby Players’ Association chief executive, Omar Hassanein, is among those who believe the players deserve a much better-structured season: “I think Gus’s comments were very relevant. More money shouldn’t mean more games and shorter rest periods. In order to get the optimum out of these players, we feel they need to be playing less anyway.“We want to ensure that pressures are not put on players to prioritise club over country. As more money gets poured into the club game, that sometimes comes with a perceived entitlement to control the player more. Whilst we understand the club is the paymaster, we think everyone needs to row in behind the fact that the international game should always be the pinnacle.”Hassanein, by the sound of it, entirely agrees with Pichot that Test rugby is coming under genuine threat. “We don’t want the sport to go to a place where the club game is so appealing that players gravitate more and more towards it and start finding reasons not to play in big internationals. Players are very proud of their nations but the game has got to tackle this head on. We need to be very careful that the sport doesn’t get steered towards a club-driven game.” Wednesday’s gathering in Sydney feels like an increasingly pivotal moment in the game’s modern history.One glance at the Gallagher Premiership table tells its own stark story. After four rounds only Saracens and Exeter are still unbeaten while the bottom seven clubs – Harlequins, Leicester, Bristol, Worcester, Newcastle, Northampton and Sale – are separated by only five points. As previously observed in these columns, neither Bristol nor Worcester will be going quietly, if at all. Newcastle and Northampton possess too many good players to be cut adrift, which leaves Harlequins, Leicester and the current basement dwellers Sale, all three Premiership champions in the not too distant past. The annual game of relegation musical chairs has never been more cut-throat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea4ceb66ba585280273653768531fd8f79b7abf/121_419_3788_2273/master/3788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b22ee4715d3d33d8f646139138fd763","title":"talking horses excellent end to sophie doyles summer in chicago","story":"American success for the British jockey suggests we made poor use of her talents while she rode hereThose of you who remember Sophie Doyle might like to know that she’s just finished third among jockeys this year at Arlington, where the season finished on Saturday. The 31-year-old had 52 winners at the Chicago track this summer, her rides accumulating $1.2m in prize money.“My goal was to come up here and be top three,” Doyle said in quotes reported on Arlington’s website. “I wanted to set the bar high for myself to be at the top of this meet and luckily we’ve managed to achieve it.”Doyle has done a deeply impressive thing in establishing a well-paid career from scratch in a country where she was an unknown. It’s not as if she was particularly well known anywhere at that time in her eight years riding in Britain, Doyle totalled 66 winners, fewer than she’s had this year alone. She hasn’t ridden here since 2012, when her mounts went 085.I can’t help thinking her success shows that trainers and owners in Britain did not make good use of her talent. Indeed, there was famously a time when her brother, James, was considering alternative careers due to lack of opportunities in the saddle he is now recognised as one of our very best jockeys. As a sport, we have to get better at spotting riding talent.Little bits of quality jump racing are turning up just now and today’s Warwick card will occupy much of my attention this afternoon. I felt more or less obliged to nap Henri Parry Morgan (4.40) when I saw him forecast to start at 25-1 but as it turns out he opened at 16-1 and is now a general 9-1 shot. Even at those odds, the old man of today’s staying handicap chase is very backable, in my view.He has not been a prolific winner, having reached an unrealistic rating after his novice season, when he was second to Native River at Aintree. But he’s dropped 12lb from his peak and is perfectly capable of winning in this company, being the better for a spin at Worcester last month.His big day last term came in the West Wales National but he doesn’t need bottomless ground and has some good bits of form to his name on a sound surface. It’s interesting that the tongue tie comes off today for the first time in years and perhaps he’ll be the happier for it. Visors go on for only the second time he was running well before falling at Cheltenham last year when they were tried before. His Ffos Las win came in first-time blinkers.In the last, you can get 8-1 about Bally Lagan (5.40), who went close at 16-1 in the same race a year ago. He’s a couple of pounds lower this time and has had a wind op since.Tips by Chris CookAt Beverley, no one wants to know Twin Appeal (3.20) but I see each-way potential at odds of 20-1. The veteran has dropped 11lb since the start of the year but has held his form fairly well, including in two runs since moving from David Barron to Karen Tutty. He doesn’t want to be in front too soon on this ground, so I’m hoping that the wide draw will dictate the he is ridden with a modicum of restraint."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29338665d9a9b68b7e312f49aa5ccdf12634b591/286_83_3096_1858/master/3096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96907ff728a3f0176f04478a008c2334","title":"instagram co founders resign to explore creativity again","story":"Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger leave the social media company amid reports of tensions with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg Instagram co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, have announced their resignation from the company, which is owned by Facebook Inc, saying that they are leaving to “explore our curiosity and creativity again”.Systrom and Krieger did not say why they were leaving their positions as chief executive officer and chief technical officer, but there were reports that their departure might be due to tensions between the men and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.Bloomberg reported that the men were leaving the photo-sharing app because of growing tensions about the direction of the business since Facebook bought Instagram in 2012. In a statement on Monday, Systrom, the CEO of the company, said he and Krieger were looking forward to “taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again”. He said they were grateful for “the last eight years at Instagram and six years with the Facebook team”.The pair will depart the company soon, and notified the leadership team of the photo-sharing app and Facebook on Monday about their decision to leave, according to Instagram. The New York Times first reported the move.Zuckerberg issued a public statement about the departure saying he had “really enjoyed” working with Systrom and Krieger.“Kevin and Mike are extraordinary product leaders and Instagram reflects their combined creative talents,” wrote Zuckerberg. “I’ve learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it. I wish them all the best and I’m looking forward to seeing what they build next.”Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 for $1bn, has more than 1 billion active monthly users and has grown by adding features like messaging and short videos.

The entrance is marked by a tiny slate bothy, where the self-employed miners used to sleep, and you get to explore the damp low tunnels below.Alfred Wainwright wandered here and mistakenly referred to the mine as a quarry. He commented: “There is no beauty in despoliation and devastation, but there can be dramatic effect and interest, and so it is here.”From the cafe, take the mine road, which runs parallel with the Honister Pass. It’s on the path of an old tramway used for moving slate. Ignore the footpath to Great Gable on the left. The grey track zigzags upwards past a slate memorial marking the reopening of Honister as both a working mine and tourist attraction by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1997. It had closed in 1989.Then it’s views of the ravaged crags across Honister Pass, a Tolkienesque mass of spoil, tracks and mysterious shafts. It’s a shattered landscape, but set into towering crags it has a strangely desolate beauty. There’s more mining detritus on the shoulder of Fleetwith, with the road marked by standing stones of slate. Turn right and head upwards on a grassy path. Close to the false summit is a ruined miners’ building, making you realise just how high up they worked.For the first two decades of the 20th century, a brilliant ornithologist lived in a houseboat called Water Rail on Hickling Broad, the largest of the flooded medieval peat-diggings that make up the Norfolk Broads. It was an unusual vocation for an Edwardian woman but Emma Turner was an extremely independent-minded person.At the time the bittern, a large and furtive brown bird, was believed to be extinct as a breeding species in England. But Turner discovered a bittern’s nest deep in Hickling’s reed beds, and took excellent photographs to prove it. She became the first female honorary member of the British Ornithologists’ Union and a small island on the broad is named in her honour.Turner’s work was instrumental in getting Hickling’s wild riches recognised and later protected. Today it is a Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserve and remains home to the resurgent bittern.Walking south from the visitor centre, take the right-hand path through oak woods to reach a low floodbank above the reedbeds that surround Hickling. Sails of boats appear above the reeds on the horizon, emphasising just how low this landscape is. Follow the bank along the north-eastern side of the broad, past bird hides and the thatched Edwardian hunting lodge once used by wealthy wildfowlers.While the bittern remains elusive, Hickling is a hotspot for the marsh harrier, a raptor rarer than a golden eagle, as well as Chinese water deer, kingfishers and barn owls. Walk along the floodbank around Hundred Acres Marsh and you’ll reach Stubb drainage windmill, one of around 200 old windpumps that once drained these marshes. Follow Stubb Road back to the visitor centre.This broadland landscape is rich in birdlife but you really experience its strange riches on the water: and this walk can be combined with a fascinating one- or two-hour wildlife water trail by electric boat (£7.50£9.50 adults, £4.50£6 children ): book at the Norfolk Wildlife Trust visitor centre or call 01603 270479. Admission to Hickling is £4 for non-Wildlife Trust members.Patrick Barkham,  writer and author of Islander (Granta, £9.99), The Butterfly Isles and BadgerlandsThis is a lovely moorland walk, including multiple standing stones marking what must have been a prehistoric trackway to the summit of Moel Goedog (367 metres). It passes two ring cairns and a late bronze age hill fort at the summit, with breathtaking views.From Harlech, the going is initially steep but eases off. With Edward I’s castle visible on the left, follow the road that winds up, bordered by high stone walls, right past Harlech castle and its visitor centre. Go straight across the crossroads, with its shops, and the moor beckons – after about three quarters of a mile, turn left at another crossroads. The first standing stone, just to the left of the road, is known as Moel Goedog 8. Carry on straight and the next stone is just by the cattle grid, with a further stone a bit further on the right sadly it’s just a broken pointed stump now.The next standing stone is on the left: here, sheep roam freely, and such stones have, in folklore, been mistaken for sheep – and tales tell of sales made to the drunken and gullible. Stay left and follow the path to another pair of stones, in a field of young bullocks. The final standing stone is Moel Goedog 5.Before the summit there are two ring cairns. First is Moel Goedog West, which is surrounded by other stones up to a metre tall. An excavation in 1978 uncovered bronze age cremation urns. From here, the Dwyryd estuary glistens below, across to distant mountains beyond. The second cairn is some 50m east, on the other side of the path. The hill fort is close to Moel Goedog’s summit and though the ditches and bank are worn, enough remains of it to be worth a visit. It’s possible to carry on a further six miles north-east to the renowned and remote “crown of thorns” cairn circle of Bryn Cader Faner, or head back down past the stones for a drink at the Branwen hotel, the rear of which you passed on the way up close to the castle.Andy Burnham, editor of The Old Stones: A Field Guide to the Megalithic Sites of Britain and Ireland (Watkins Media). More information on these sites at megalithicThis circular walk in north Cornwall takes in clifftops and wooded valleys as well as a tiny driftwood hut. Hawker’s Hut, the focus of the walk, sits high on the cliff and is where eccentric opium-smoking poet-priest Robert Stephen Hawker meditated and wrote poetry.From the Bush Inn, follow the road down to Morwenstow church and into the churchyard, past the figurehead of the Caledonia, a brig wrecked in 1843, which marks the burials Hawker officiated at. Morwenstow, set back from a treacherous stretch of coast, was where Hawker became known both as a missionary to a community of wreckers and smugglers, and as a poet with an eclectic dress sense. (He was often seen in a stylish combination of purple coat, white cravat, fisherman’s jumper and beaver hat.)Follow the path through the graveyard to a stone stile, then past the Old Vicarage into the wooded valley below. Turn left before you reach the stream and follow the valley to emerge at the sea, with Lundy Island visible in the distance. Climb steep steps on your left to the cliff top and five minutes further on is Hawker’s Hut, a tiny room the vicar constructed out of timbers from a wrecked ship. It was his place of sanctuary and inspiration, where he wrote – and indulged in the odd toke on an opium pipe.With a figure like Hawker it’s difficult to distinguish the man from the myth but sit in the hut and listen to waves surging against the cliffs and it’s easy to understand why he loved this place. It’s a hard spot to leave but, back on the path, head on towards the GCHQ radar array before turning left, away from the sea, by Higher Sharpnose Point (where The Caledonia ran aground) up the valley to the signed path left across the fields and back to the 13th-century Bush Inn.Wyl Menmuir, author of Man Booker long-listed The Many (Salt, £8.99)Lengthtime 4½ miles, 3 hoursStartfinish GalmisdaleRefuel Galmisdale Bay cafe and pubThe tiny island of Eigg, off the west coast of Scotland, was, according to legend, the dominion a Pictish queen and her tribe of outsize female warriors. This walk takes you to the Loch of the Big Women, where the sisterhood met an untimely end.From the hamlet of Galmisdale follow the left hand fork in the road through mossy woods scented with wild garlic. Head to Galmisdale farmhouse across a meadow and turn left where the footpath reaches the rough hill track. Look out for the red spots that mark the ascent up Sgùrr, a rock formed from volcanic lava, which sits atop the island like a slightly squashed Hovis loaf.The climb up the hill is steady rather than gruelling. Wheatears bob along in front, flashing their white undercarriage and the high hill country opens up around you. In the distance you can see the Celtic cross that marks the site of the monastery of Kildonan. It was here that St Donan and his brotherhood of 52 monks set up home. The queen took exception to this invasion of her island and sought revenge in a fashion typical of the bloody history of the Highlands by chopping off the monks’ heads after mass.The loch appears as the main track veers away to climb the summit. Follow a sheep track through the heather to the little mirrored bowl set within the hills. According to the story, after murdering the monks, the queen and her followers saw lights appear in the sky and followed these across the moors to this spot where they were led into the water and drowned while attempting to reach the tiny island in the centre. Carol Donaldson, writer and conservationist, is the author of On the Marshes (Little Toller Books, £10)Lengthtime 7.1 miles, 4 hoursStartfinish Cow and Calf Rocks car parkRefuel Cow and Calf CafeIlkley Moor, or Rombald’s Moor as it’s officially titled, has always loomed large in my world. I grew up in an old house on its north-west edge, and lived in its shadow until I was 23. Its wild, heathery expanses, niches of wood, hidden streams and peat bogs were a playground for us kids. From bronze age cup-and-ring carvings to stone circles, alien sightings to tales of Charles Darwin taking its waters – the moor’s histories and myths seized our imaginations as surely as the landscape got in our blood.Now, whenever I return to walk this seven-mile circular, it feels no less eerie and spectacular – a place that can change in a moment, yet remain timeless. At the age of 17, half-cut and showing off, I carved my name on that moor but Ilkley Moor had carved itself into me long before.Start at the Cow and Calf Rocks car park, scrambling up the easy climb inside the gritstone quarry or taking the footpath around it. The expansive views of the River Wharfe and the Yorkshire Dales have been a magnet for centuries, as the rock graffiti testifies. Look for “E M Lancaster, 1st Battalion XXIV Foot, 1882” – chiselled a few years after that regiment fought at Rorke’s Drift. Once up, follow the footpath left to wind on to moor proper.Head towards The Haystack, a slab of rock covered with some of the 400 neolithic and bronze age cup-and-ring marks on this moor. While the town below dates its origins to a first century AD Roman cavalry fort, these patterns are 4,000 years old. It’s the same with the Twelve Apostles – a restored stone circle, another 20 minutes further south along a boardwalk path, on Burley Moor.Double back and carry straight on through Ilkley Crags before turning left and following the footpath west. This is heather and bracken upland country that turns a gorgeous russet and rust-brown under autumn skies, and where you can hear curlews – especially now the moor’s grouse shooting license has been revoked. Drop down to the Swastika Stone, overlooking the valley. This ancient curved-limb cup-and-ring carving used to be thought of as bronze age but its striking similarity to the Camunian Rose means it was most likely carved by a Roman soldier stationed at Ilkley.Trek back east along the footpath over town, looking for a white dot up on the moor line. White Wells is a relic of Ilkley’s boomtown past as a spa resort with its own, freezing cold, peat-brown dipping pool for the brave. It was here that Charles Darwin rambled, hid out and took the waters when On the Origin of Species was published in 1859. It was here, too, that in 1987 a retired copper photographed what he believed to be an alien being, which beckoned him away before vanishing in a UFO. Apparently, the incident has yet to be exposed as a hoax, which lends the moors an even greater air of mystery.Follow the path up top and open your stride all the way back to the Cow and Calf car park, tracing the footsteps of the mill-working Methodists from Halifax who, on a chapel outing to the moor, created Yorkshire’s anthem, On Ilkla Moor Baht ’At, about the perils of courting without appropriate headgear. Time it right and there’ll be an amazing autumn sunset as you take a restorative tea in the car park cafe, or something stronger in the pub across the road.Rob Cowen, award-winning writer and author of Common Ground, voted the UK’s third-favourite nature book in 2018Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Here’s why it’s one of 2018’s hidden gemsThis month’s Sunday night viewing wars have given us a heroic clash of mettle on mettle. While most viewers sided with BBC1’s Bodyguard, I’ve pinned my colours to ITV’s adaptation of Vanity Fair.Both are masterclasses in sexual politics, but whereas Jed Mercurio’s pairing of a lonely home secretary with her physically and psychologically scarred minder led us up an implausible cul-de-sac, William Thackeray commands the heights of social satire with a story that, to co-opt one of his most famous pronouncements, “gives back to every era the reflection of its own face”.It’s a familiar complaint that no film or TV version can live up to the novel, because none can be so unremittingly nasty. But before dismissing this latest adaptation, it is worth bearing in mind the less familiar second part of that mirror quote: “Frown at it and it will in turn look sourly upon you laugh at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion.” Ever since Chester M Franklin’s expressionist 1932 version brought Vanity Fair into the age of the talkies, with Myrna Loy as a hollow-eyed casino hustler bound for a tragic end, interpretations have lined up along the spectrum this quote suggests.The tone is always set by Becky Sharp herself, who has become increasingly impossible to caricature over the decades, as a low-born orphan battling the disadvantages of class and gender. The more extreme the scenario, the harder it is for an actor to get their claws into the role – witness Reese Witherspoon, left with nowhere to go but nice, against the flamboyant colonial ghastliness of Mira Nair and Julian Fellowes’ 2004 movie version.Writer Gwyneth Hughes gets round this by emphasising the illusory nature of the story, as did Thackeray himself, opening each episode with a top-hatted Michael Palin directing the revolutions of a gilded merry-go-round. It is a different sort of textual faithfulness than the usual deployment of the costume department’s finest regimental scarlets to the mustering scenes, although this series does that too. It is a faithfulness to Thackeray’s tone, to his direct address to the reader, which draws us into complicity with his God’s-eye view of the human comedy.Awareness of this artifice is kept going with knowing camera work: Olivia Cooke’s Becky might be as fresh-faced and charismatic as they come, but she stands apart from her companions in being allowed regularly to break the fourth wall with conspiratorial glances. The key early encounters with the snobbish parents of her schoolfriend, Amelia, set up a double irony as she is stared down by Sam, the Sedleys’ black servant.Richie Campbell’s Sam is a revelation: a proud and contemptuous figure who slips across the background of a scene in which Becky boasts to her new friends that her mother was a Montmorency. He also usurps her first attempt to entrap the tubby Collector of Boggley Wollah, by bursting into the room with a towering gateau.In true Thackeray style, the more ridiculous a character, the more odious their hypocrisies. David Fynn’s sneezing and stammering Jos Sedley is on the verge of becoming the pitiable victim of Becky’s wiles when his social floundering inflates into drunken monstrosity. It gets worse when Becky is exiled to the rundown Pitt Crawley mansion, where she faces down the advances of Martin Clunes’s gurning Worzel Gummidge of a baronet and the bossy pieties of his son and daughter-in-law, only to find herself enveloped in the toxic confidence of the vicious Aunt Matilda, who is gloriously played by Frances de la Tour as a gleefully vicious toad in a mobcap. Perhaps she’s a warning of what Becky might become, given too much of the worldly power she so desires.All comic grotesques need their stooges – and this is the hardest position to hold in such a vicious satire. After a queasy initial backstairs encounter, the romance between Becky and Tom Bateman’s Rawdon is played pretty straight: here, it’s clear, is a match both of libidos and lusts for life. As such it’s in counterpoint to the peevish alliance of Claudia Jessie’s fluttery Amelia and Charlie Rowe’s puppyish George, whose ardour seems as limp as the bouquet he thrusts at Becky as battle looms on the night of the regimental ball in Belgium. (Bouquets, rather wonderfully, seem to be enacting a shadow drama of their own in the first four episodes.)Where, quite, this all leaves Dobbin, the faithful friend and constant lover, remains to be seen. Johnny Flynn doesn’t aspire to the the bruised charisma of Philip Glenister in the 1998 BBC mini-series (scripted by Andrew Davies). So far, he’s a colourless character, whose occasional clumsiness seems incidental rather than a defining – and endearing – trait. Perhaps it’s not the social climbing woman, but the honourable man who has a hard time finding his reflection in the mirror of the current era. But Dobbin has another two episodes in which to press his suit and we shall all just have to wait and see."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d87e509831f6c3cf7a2660b34f9e9fa53b405f6/0_125_3396_2036/master/3396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8beef20343f1b055d8982e79772e5146","title":"jacinda ardern makes history with baby neve at un general assembly","story":"New Zealand prime minister is the first female world leader to bring an infant to the meeting in New YorkNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has made history as the first female world leader to attend the United Nations general assembly meeting with her newborn baby in tow.Ardern appeared with her infant daughter at the UN on Monday evening, and played with her before giving a speech at the Nelson Mandela peace summit. While she spoke, Ardern’s partner Clarke Gayford held the three-month-old baby on his lap.Ardern gave birth to Neve Te Aroha at Auckland Hospital on 21 June and returned to work in early August after taking six weeks maternity leave.The prime minister is continuing to breastfeed her daughter, meaning Neve had to travel with her to New York for the six-day trip.Asked by the Today show on the US NBC network if it was harder to govern New Zealand or take her daughter on a 17-hour flight, Ardern responded with a laugh and said “It felt at the time on par” and said she had apologised to her fellow passengers in advance.Ardern revealed that juggling parenthood and the prime ministership had “met my expectations” but the joy she felt at Neve “had far surpassed my expectations”.Ardern’s partner Clarke Gayford – a fishing television presenter – is Neve’s primary carer, and has travelled with Ardern to New York to look after the baby.Last week the rules were tweaked in New Zealand to allow the prime minister or ministers to travel with a nanny on overseas assignments, and have this covered by the taxpayer.However, Ardern said Gayford’s tickets to New York and expenses would be paid for out of her own pocket, because there were few official spousal engagements Gayford would be required to attend, and most of his time would be taken up caring for Neve.Gayford posted a photo on Twitter on Monday of Neve’s security pass, which reads “first baby”.He added: “I wish I could have captured the startled look on a Japanese delegation inside UN yesterday who walked into a meeting room in the middle of a nappy change. Great yarn for her 21st (birthday).”Ardern has earned a reputation as a frugal leader who recently froze MPs salaries for a year and makes her ministers carpool to events.“There is no spousal programme for this, so we just made a judgment call that we would cover his travel for this trip. He will be going to some things, but he’s primarily travelling to care for Neve,” Ardern told the New Zealand Herald.Ardern said they had not committed to taking their daughter to any official events, and they were “playing it by ear” depending on how she was affected by the travel. “There is no set plan, it’s just whether or not she’s getting enough sleep, where I am for feeds. They might be with us a lot, they might just be in the hotel.“It depends what the jet lag does to them both. She’s a good sleeper and we don’t know whether that will mean she ends up sleeping a lot in the day rather than the night.”On Sunday, Ardern gave her first speech in New York at Unicef’s social good summit, restating her commitment to ending child poverty and making her country the best place in the world to be a child.Ardern’s fellow panellists commented on how peaceful Neve was waiting backstage with her father and Ardern joked that she “wasn’t at 3:30 this morning”.“I have the ability to take my child to work, there’s not many places you can do that. I am not the gold standard for bringing up a child in this current environment because there are things about my circumstances that are not the same,” Ardern said.Ardern outlined the exceptional circumstances that make it possible for her to raise Neve while continuing as prime minister, which she has frequently stated she hopes will one day be the norm for all women wanting to balance a career and parenting.“If I can do one thing, and that is change the way we think about these things, then I will be pleased we have achieved something.”Former Pakistani prime minister Benzir Bhutto is the only other world leader to give birth while in office when she had a baby girl in January 1990. She was dismissed as leader of her country seven months later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efee5d5be0371620eb52f894e93c281ce5a7b66b/0_199_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85e2d6836403b24f23b80d4cbf3c531b","title":"macron faces up to france algeria colonial past with 40m euros harkis aid","story":"President to honour families of Algerians who sided with France in war of independenceEmmanuel Macron will offer honours and a financial support package to the families of Algerians who aided French troops in the war of independence, as part of a wider policy of confronting his country’s colonial legacy in north Africa.Earlier this month, the French president took the historic step of acknowledging for the first time that France carried out systematic torture during the 1954-62 conflict.Macron – the first French president born after the Algerian conflict – has turned his attention to the Algerians known as “harkis”, a loaded and often pejorative term for the Algerian Muslims who helped the French in the brutal eight-year independence war and faced discrimination and poverty in France.Macron is granting national honours to more than 20 former fighters and those who have campaigned for recognition for the harkis as well as a €40m (£36m) support package designed largely to help their descendants, who still face marginalisation and poverty.After a peace accord granted Algerian independence in March 1962, about 60,000 Algerian loyalists were allowed into France. There, they were often kept in camps behind barbed wire and suffered discrimination, marginalisation and poverty that has lasted across generations. Tens of thousands more were left behind in Algeria and faced reprisals.The fate of the harkis in France and their descendants, who number hundreds of thousands, remains a highly sensitive issue in Paris, acting as a reminder of its colonial history.In recent years, films and novels have tackled the issue of discrimination against harkis. In a bestselling novel last year, The Art of Losing, the writer Alice Zeniter tackled the assumptions in France around the term “harkis” and highlighted the haphazard and uncertain ways a person might pick a side in a conflict as brutal as Algeria’s independence war. Some harkis had previously fought for France in the second world war.Macron acknowledged that the French military instituted a “system” that facilitated torture as it sought to cling on to its 130-year rule in the country. He said the past must be faced with “courage and lucidity”.The French government is to present its package of financial support over four years for descendants of harkis. But concerns persist over whether the support will be sufficient and whether France should go further and offer a full official apology.The Algerian conflict, which has been shrouded in secrecy and denials, is still seen as unresolved in the French collective psyche. Macron is said to view it as a isive factor that must be addressed.Macron caused controversy during the presidential campaign last year by declaring that France’s colonisation of Algeria was a “crime against humanity”. He later backtracked on his comments, calling for “neither denial nor repentance” over France’s colonial history, adding: “We cannot remain trapped in the past.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639655.1537796718!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tidy towns the full list of winners for 2018","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWestport, Co Mayo, which was named tidiest large town in this year’s Tidy Towns competition.

Photograph: Tom Honan for The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned Minister of State Catherine Byrne that she will be sacked if she does not support Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy in a Dáil vote on Tuesday.Speaking in New York where he is attending the United Nations, Mr Varadkar said if Ms Byrne did not vote confidence in the Minister for Housing, she could no longer continue as a Minister herself.“It’s of course the case that if a Minister can’t express confidence in their own colleagues, that they can’t continue as a Minister,” Mr Varadkar said.“We’re a Government, we’re collective, we make decisions together, and if a Minister doesn’t have confidence in another Minister and votes that way then obviously they couldn’t continue. But, as I say, she hasn’t had that conversation with me yet.”Mr Murphy told RTÉ\u0027s Morning Ireland this morning that he hoped to meet Ms Byrne before the vote. I hope that she won\u0027t be pulled into this Sinn\u0026nbspFéin stunt later this evening, he said.\u0026nbspThe reports of Ms Byrne’s potential defection on Monday prompted a flurry of headcounts in Government Buildings.There is scheduled to be an incorporeal Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning – with Ministers contacted by telephone to secure their assent for a decision – to approve a counter-motion expressing confidence in the Minister for Housing.Tuesday’s regular Cabinet meeting has been postponed until Thursday due to Mr Varadkar being in New York.Mr Varadkar’s comments follow reports that Ms Byrne was considering voting against her colleague, after differences between the two over a large affordable housing scheme in her constituency. Ms Byrne is a Minister of State at the Department of Health and a TD for Dublin South Central.Mr Varadkar said he would meet Ms Byrne when he returned from the US on Tuesday. A spokesman for Mr Murphy said he was also likely to meet Ms Byrne.Ms Byrne surprised Mr Murphy by publicly opposing a new housing scheme in Inchicore at its launch. His plans for the site would see the construction of about 470 homes, 30 of which would be used for social housing with 60 per cent available on a cost rental basis, for rent to low- and middle-income workers.Speaking at the event, Mr Murphy said the development would be a “game changer” for the rental market. However, at the event, Ms Byrne said it was “probably one of the worst plans” she had seen for the site. She has since continued to campaign against the proposals.But yesterday the Taoiseach gave his backing to Mr Murphy, saying it was often the case that Ministers had objections to developments in their own areas, but “it is Government policy to build new houses”.“We’re in a housing crisis, we need to build lots of new houses. It’s Government policy to have high-density housing nearer to our cities and it’s Government policy to have mixed housing, social housing, affordable housing.”Ms Byrne was uncontactable last night and did not respond to a message. However in a statement on Twitter last night, Ms Byrne she said she wanted to see St Michael’s Estate developed but did not believe a high-density apartment block was the right choice. It would put huge pressure on an “already fractured community”, she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3640148.1537820525!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bradley to stress uk s opposition to hard irish border when in us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley  will meet senior politicians on Capitol Hill who have a strong interest in Northern Ireland.

Photograph: PA The chairman of the public inquiry into a botched green energy scheme in Northern Ireland has voiced concern over how both the DUP and Sinn Féin appointed advisers. DUP leader Arlene Foster, who is making her second appearance as a witness at the inquiry, said “I’m not going to say there’s not room for improvement.” Mrs Foster also revealed that discussions had taken place with other parties around governance at the powersharing institutions at Stormont, and that the appointment of special advisers was included in those discussions.She defended the suitability of her party’s special advisers. She said the DUP is no different to other parties in how they appoint advisers.“I don’t think we were any different at all, if you look at the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP, certainly Sinn Féin put people into posts from their backroom team, we were no different,” she told the inquiry.“I will say this, all of the special advisers that the DUP appointed were people who had third-level education, and who had an ability to work within the system. I am not sure that that can be said about every other special adviser.” Mrs Foster told the inquiry that as a Stormont minister, you were “thrown in at the deep end”. She said that needs to be rectified when or if the Northern Ireland Assembly is reinstated. Mrs Foster served as enterprise minister, finance minister, environment minister and also first minister at various times during devolution in Northern Ireland. “When you become a minister, you are thrown in at the deep end,” she told the inquiry. Mrs Foster said there was no training day and you relied on advice, your own reading and senior civil servants. “I think that is a shortcoming and is something that needs to be rectified when or if the Assembly gets up and running again.”Earlier, Mrs Foster told a public inquiry into a botched green energy scheme that if she had known the scale of the difficulties around the RHI scheme in the autumn of 2015, she would have raised it during the Fresh Start Talks with Sinn Féin. Those talks took place following a crisis at Stormont sparked by the murder of republican Kevin McGuigan in Belfast, and questions over whether the Provisional IRA was responsible. The Fresh Start talks took place in September and October 2015, resulting in the Fresh Start Agreement in November 2015. Mrs Foster said if she had known about the spiralling costs of the RHI scheme she would have raised it in those talks, when they were negotiating more money from the Treasury. She told the inquiry she knew there was an issue with the RHI scheme in June 2015 but did not know the specifics. “If we had of known there was such an issue, thinking about this over the last few days, with funding, then that’s something that would have been dealt with in the Fresh Start Talks,” she told the inquiry. “During those political talks we had asked Treasury for assistance in relation to further funding, so if we had of known the scale of it before the Fresh Start Talks, we certainly would have raised it as an issue in those talks. There were absolutely no discussion about RHI in the Fresh Start Talks.”She is expected to address claims by former DUP enterprise minister Jonathan Bell that the party attempted to “fit him up” to take the blame for how costs of the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme spiralled.In her statement to the inquiry which was published on the inquiry’s website on Monday, Mrs Foster denied claims there was a “party narrative” by the DUP to discredit Mr Bell. - PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3640044.1537812331!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"former french pm seeks political redemption in barcelona","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tManuel Valls during a demonstration to support the unity of Spain in Barcelona. Photograph: Pau BarrenaAFPGetty ImagesManuel Valls was born 56 years ago in Barcelona, but his Swiss mother and Catalan father, a well-known painter, moved to Paris to escape Franco’s rule. He was naturalised a French citizen at the age of 20 and rose through the ranks of the socialist party to become François Hollande’s interior minister (2012-2014), then prime minister (2014-2016).Now, in what may prove to be an unprecedented act of self-reinvention and political resurrection, Valls is set to announce his candidacy to become mayor of Barcelona at a “civic event” at the Centre of Contemporary Culture in Barcelona on Tuesday evening.No head of a European government has pursued a political career in another EU country. The closest parallels are the 19th-century statesman Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was born in Nice and served in both the Italian and French parliaments, and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who was elected four times an MEP, twice as a German and twice as a French man.Valls says his interest in the Barcelona town hall is “an illustration of European citizenship”. Whether or not he wins, it may be a one-way trip. His prolonged absence has angered fellow deputies in the French National Assembly. And constituents in the Paris suburb of Evry, who Valls represented since 2002, feel abandoned. \u0026nbspWhile Valls spent more and more time in Barcelona this year, “nobody was in charge here”, a retired woman in Evry told Le Parisien newspaper. “The politicians all take us for fools. They ask us to vote for them, and then a year later they go away ... ”When Valls visited then taoiseach Enda Kenny in Dublin in April 2015, many French people fervently hoped for a presidential contest between Valls and the conservative politician Alain Juppé. It never happened. Rarely has such a promising political career fizzled out so inauspiciously.As interior minister, Valls had been the scourge of itinerant Roma. In the midst of jihadist attacks, his rhetoric was interpreted as Islamophobic. Things started going wrong for Valls when he took his sons on a government jet to a football match in Berlin. He was perceived as ill-tempered and over-ambitious.In a humiliating blow, Valls was defeated in the socialist presidential primary in January 2017. He nearly lost the seat he had held for 15 years in subsequent legislative elections, scraping through by only 139 votes over his far-left challenger from the France Unbowed party.Valls’s Catalan critics say he has come to Barcelona only because he was shoved aside by President Emmanuel Macron. Sources close to both politicians confirm the deep antipathy between them.When Macron was economy minister under Valls, he blamed Valls for gutting his reforms of bus transport and Sunday trading, then depriving Macron of the satisfaction of a parliamentary vote by passing his law by decree.It was a nightmare for Valls to see the young upstart with virtually no political experience snatch France’s highest political office from under his nose. To add insult to injury, Macron refused to allow Valls to stand for the National Assembly on the En Marche! ticket.Both Macron and Valls are pro-European social democrats who have been accused of veering to the right. Like Macron, Valls says the left-right ide in politics is outdated. Valls’s campaign in Barcelona looks set to mimic Macron’s winning formula.The centre-right Spanish party Ciudadanos (Citizens) supports Valls, but he may prefer to stand as an independent, in the hope of winning votes across as broad a spectrum as possible.A year after the referendum on Catalan independence, most of the leaders of the separatist movement are in prison or in exile, like the former president of the region, Carles Puigdemont, who lives in Belgium. Pro-Spanish Catalans believe they have found an articulate spokesman in Valls.Valls’s private life has followed the twists and turns of his political career. He had four children with his first wife, a school teacher. He and his second wife, a concert violinist, announced they were orcing last April. Valls had a brief liaison with the spokeswoman for the En Marche! group in the National Assembly.Then he was introduced to Susana Gallardo (53), the fabulously wealthy heiress to the Almirall pharmaceutical fortune and ex-wife of the owner of the Pronovias chain of wedding dress stores.Gallardo owns a mansion in Menorca and an apartment in Barcelona, where Valls now lives. Like Valls, she is a passionate advocate of Spanish unity. Valls’s detractors back in Paris say Gallardo’s influence and contacts book may be the most attractive things about her."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3640668.1537863223!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sunken remains of 400 year old ship found off portuguese coast","story":"Portuguese archaeologists described the discovery of a centuries-old shipwreck off the coast of Cascais, near Lisbon, as the country\u0027s discovery of the decade, on Monday (September 24) at a news conference in the coastal city.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Divers with the  centuries-old shipwreck off the coast of Cascais, Portugal.

Photograph: Augusto SalgadoCascais City HallHandout via ReutersArchaeologists in Portugal have discovered peppercorns, fragments of Chinese porcelain and bronze cannon among the sunken remains of a 400-year-old ship that once sailed the spice route between Europe and India. The wreck of the still-unidentified vessel was found at the beginning of September by a team of experts surveying the area around the town of Cascais, about 26km west of Lisbon. The wreck site, which sits about 12 metres below the surface, is about 100 metres long and 50 metres wide.The teams say the discovery will shed light on both Portugal’s trading past and Cascais’s place within it. “We found the ship on 4 September, using a geophysical survey and ers, and spent four days working on the site,” said Jorge Freire, a maritime archaeologist and scientific director of the underwater archeological survey.He said ers had also come across cowrie shells, which were used in the slave trade.“We don’t know the name of the ship, but it’s a Portuguese ship from the late 16th or early 17th century,” he said, adding that the team had been able to put a rough date on the wreck as the cannon bore the Portuguese coat of arms and the porcelain belonged to the Wanli period (1573-1619).“It tells us a great deal about Cascais’s maritime history and identity,” said Freire. “It’s like we’ve been telling the local people here: this is a great discovery and its greatness lies in what it – and the artefacts – can tell is about the cultural landscape.”The pieces will now be examined by the Portuguese government’s directorate-general for cultural heritage.The mayor of Cascais, Carlos Carreiras, described the discovery as one of the most significant archaeological finds of the past decade. He said that although the cargo ship had yet to be identified, it could prove significant to the town.“It’s an extraordinary discovery that allows us to know more about our history, reinforcing our collective identity and shared values,” said Mr Carreiras. “That, in turn, will certainly make us more attractive and competitive.”The discovery comes 24 years after experts found the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos Martires (Our Lady of the Martyrs), which also sailed the spice route and sank off Lisbon in 1606.According to the survey team, who have been mapping the areas since 2009, the latest wreck is in better structural shape than the Nossa Senhora dos Martires. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639723.1537798381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer has michael atiyah conquered the everest of mathematics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn undated portrait of German mathematician Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866). Riemann established the foundations of modern differential geometry and, in 1859, formulated the hypothesis that bears his name.  Photograph: BettmannGetty ImagesA major mathematical result has been announced by British-Lebanese mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah. In a talk at the 6th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in Germany on Monday Atiyah outlined what he described as “a simple proof using a radically new approach” of the Riemann hypothesis – the most celebrated problem in modern mathematics.The Riemann hypothesis (RH) was highlighted by the great German mathematician David Hilbert at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. Hilbert remarked: “If I were to awaken after sleeping for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?” The proof (or refutation) may come tomorrow, or we may have to wait for a century or more. The Riemann hypothesis is the Everest of mathematics.When asked which mathematicians he most admired, Atiyah named Bernhard Riemann and Irishman William Rowan Hamilton. Riemann established the foundations of modern differential geometry and, in 1859, formulated the hypothesis that bears his name. His work had a profound influence on the mathematics of the 20th century. He was very far in advance of his times, a deep and innovative mathematician. Riemannian geometry was the framework for Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Hamilton formulated what we call Hamiltonian mechanics, and invented quaternions. All the numbers we are familiar with, the “real numbers”, can be arranged as points on a line. But we can also consider points in a plane these give a richer set of numbers, the complex numbers. Each point in the plane has co-ordinates (a, b) and it was Hamilton who first gave the rules for multiplying pairs of numbers. This led him on to the more complicated quaternions numbers in four-dimensional space. It is obvious that x - 4 is zero when x  4. We say that the function f (x)  x - 4 has a zero at x  4. You may recall solving quadratic equations at school: these have two zeros. The Riemann zeta function is much trickier, and has an infinity of zeros. This function, defined by Riemann, takes a value for each point in the complex plane. Some of these values are zero: the negative even numbers, -2, -4, and so on all yield zero. Riemann believed the remaining zeros are on a vertical line, the critical line, in the complex plane. This is the Riemann hypothesis which, despite strenuous efforts, has never been proven. The RH can be formulated in erse and seemingly unrelated ways, some of which look deceptively simple: many statements equivalent to RH involve only real numbers. The hypothesis is inextricably intertwined with the distribution of prime numbers (primes cannot be expressed as products of smaller numbers), and the proof would have major consequences in number theory. Michael Berry of Bristol University encapsulates the hypothesis in the phrase “the primes have music in them”.Born in London in 1929, Atiyah was awarded a doctorate at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1955 for a thesis entitled Some Applications of Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry. One of the leading mathematicians of the 20th century and still at the coal-face, Atiyah has spent most of his academic life in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004. Both of these awards are considered comparable to a Nobel Prize. His main interests have been in algebraic geometry, index theory and gauge theory. His best known result, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, proved in 1963, makes connections between geometry and quantum field theory. He has collaborated with many leading mathematicians and his work has revealed important interactions between geometry and physics. The proof presented by Atiyah depends on a new function called the Todd function, and is underpinned by ideas introduced by John von Neumann, a giant among 20th century mathematics. In his analytical theory, von Neumann introduced “the infinite iteration of exponentials”. The Todd function is related to the fine structure constant of fundamental physics, and Atiyah said that he “stumbled upon the proof” of RH while studying the fine structure constant. The proof is by contradiction: Atiyah assumes a zero off the critical line and shows that this leads to an impossible result. Therefore, the hypothesis must be true and the theorem is proved! Proof of RH has been outstanding for 160 years. Many reputable mathematicians have attempted and failed to prove it. Atiyah’s result, if right, would be a dramatic breakthrough. There is very little chance that he is correct: major proofs normally require large advances in understanding, while Atiyah has claimed a “simple proof”. His outline may lead to a complete proof or, more likely, may amount to nothing. In recent years, Atiyah has claimed to have proved other remarkable results but has failed to convince his peers. It seems incredible that Atiyah is right, but we will have to await the judgment of experts before we learn if he will collect the $1 million Millennium Prize.Prof Peter Lynch writes the That’s Maths column on The  science page and is emeritus professor at UCD School of Mathematics \u0026amp Statistics"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn we re ready for a general election","story":"  September 23, 2018Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said the party must back members on new Brexit vote   September 23, 2018Agreement should have \u0026lsquosame benefits\u0026rsquo as customs union and single market membership   September 24, 2018Delegates at party conference on Tuesday are expected to support another referendum "},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

According to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources.

Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days.

The information will be presented in graphs, and users are offered the ability to ban themselves from specific apps, for instance.But those charts – intended as a way of allowing people to better control their use of their phone – have turned out to be more than a little horrifying to many users. Many appear to have used their last few minutes of available time to tweet about just how miserable their incessant tweeting is making them.Others embraced ignorance as a way of avoiding the horrifying graphs.Many found, however that the feature is actually working – despite or perhaps because of the feelings of shame. The feature was introduced by Apple as a way of allowing people to use their phone for what they actually want to do, which appears to be paying off.One important group affected by the changes are children. Apple allows the Screen Time feature to be controlled within families – meaning, for instance, that parents can set limits for their children, who can ask for more time if they need it.Screen Time is just one of a vast range of features introduced in iOS 12, Apple\u0027s latest iPhone update. They also include other features intended on improving people\u0027s relationship with their phone, including alterations to the way notifications work.The feature should nudge users into using it when the latest update is installed.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/17/11/aran-islands-cart-1950s-ireland.jpg","title":"travel ireland aran islands visit travel accommodation to do remote","story":"Created with Sketch.At the end of the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, playwright JM Synge\u0026nbspescaped to the\u0026nbspstripped back and simple life on\u0026nbspInishmore, Inishmaan\u0026nbspand Inisheer. Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”We both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/25/08/rtr23363.jpg","title":"next online sales brexit border delays exchange rates retail","story":"Created with Sketch.High street chain has hedged exposure to exchange rate volatility for next two yearsClick to followThe IndependentNext expects less than half of sales to come from retail stores this yearRetailer Next has set out its plans for a no-deal Brexit and said the biggest risk to its business over the next few years is the potential for long delays at UK and EU ports. The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. According to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured\u0026nbspexchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31.

mcdonnell","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followIndy PoliticsLabour confirms Remain can be party\u0027s choice in new Brexit referendum after split between top figuresLabour is embroiled in a row over the party’s approach to a Final Say Brexit referendum, following a split between two of the shadow cabinet’s most senior figures.Sir Keir Starmer, the party’s Brexit spokesman,\u0026nbspwas forced to confirm that remaining in the EU will be a potential option in a future referendum backed by Labour\u0026nbspafter\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor,\u0026nbspruled the idea out.Amid a backlash Mr McDonnell rowed back on his comments, and later conceded at a meeting at the party’s conference in Liverpool that Labour could still back a new vote that would see the party stay in the EU.It comes as Sir Keir will tell Labour conference on Tuesday that the party is set to oppose the deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels, having determined that it cannot meet his “six tests”.Another shadow cabinet minister, Barry Gardiner, also broke ranks to say that the idea the party will be able to secure a general\u0026nbspelection if Ms May’s plans fall apart was “looney tunes territory”.If the prime minister’s Brexit plans are rejected by parliament, and no election is forthcoming, then Labour’s new policy – arduously negotiated by Mr Starmer this week and to be approved on Tuesday – would see the party committed to a new Brexit referendum.It follows The Independent’s\u0026nbspFinal Say campaign for a people’s vote on the outcome of Brexit, which has been backed by more than 820,000 people in a petition.Mr McDonnell’s U-turn came at a fringe meeting where he was asked what options Labour would allow on the ballot paper, under its new policy on a further Brexit referendum.Flights grounded if UK leaves EU with no air deal, ministers admitAccepting Brexit is like happily paying for a meal you never receivedA final Brexit vote without Remain on the ballot would be nonsensicalCorbyn and McDonnell have forgotten they know nothing about BrexitMPs condemn Labour plan to deny option to Remain in fresh Brexit votePushed at the meeting as to whether he meant that Remain could be on the ballot paper in a referendum, Mr McDonnell commented: “That’s what he said.”Setting out his personal views, and underlining the future battles likely to be fought over the issue, he went on: “The issue there is, we’re saying respect the past referendum, and I just tell you, we have to be careful what we wish for here.”It marked a change in tone from an earlier interview he had given on Brexit in which he said that said Labour would “go for a people’s vote” on leaving the EU, but any referendum would not include an option to stay in the bloc.It came after an official Labour meeting agreed that on Tuesday the party would vote on whether to accept a policy stating that if the prime minister’s Brexit plans collapse, but the Tories refuse to call an election, “Labour must support all options remaining on the table including a public vote”.\u0026nbspEarlier in the day, Sir Keir had waded in to clear up the confusion caused by Mr McDonnell’s initial comments, telling The Independent: “The idea is to retain flexibility, the motion doesn’t rule out Remain, it doesn’t tie us to any position on what should be in any future vote.” \u0026nbspThe shadow cabinet minister, apparently reacting to anger in the wake of Mr McDonnell’s words, made similar comments to delegates at a fringe meeting on Monday.People’s vote supporters had condemned Mr McDonnell’s suggestion that a new referendum should exclude a Remain option as “farcical”.David Lammy, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Labour members support a People’s Vote by almost nine to one – 90 per cent of Labour members want to stay in the EU.“They did not do this to be offered a farcical referendum on no deal or a bad deal. It absolutely must include the right to stay in the EU.”People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchOn Tuesday Sir Keir will tell conference Labour is preparing to vote against Theresa May’s Brexit deal, as new party analysis indicated her Chequers proposals cannot meet Labour’s six tests.He will also commit Labour to vote down a “blind Brexit”\u0026nbspthat risks the UK jumping “into the unknown” – an increasing danger amid claims that any withdrawal agreed by Ms May will necessarily have to be vague so that she can get her fractious backbenchers to vote for it.Sir Keir will say: “A Tory civil war that has gone on for years, now threatens our future prosperity. The party that once promised that it would fix the roof while the sun was shining is now intent on burning the whole house down.\u0026nbsp“So, I’ve got a message for the Prime Minister. ‘If your party wants to tear itself apart, that’s fine, but you’re not taking our country with you.’”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"labour conference live updates jeremy corbyn speech brexit mp theresa may conservatives latest news","story":"Created with Sketch.Follow for live updates from LiverpoolClick to followIndy PoliticsSir Keir\u0026nbspStarmer\u0026nbspvows \u0027nobody is ruling out Remain\u0027 to rapturous applauseLabour \u0027likely\u0027 to vote against Theresa May\u0027s Brexit agreement, says Keir StarmerLabour’s plan for female deputy leader collapses, triggering accusations of dirty tricks by Corbyn’s teamInside the meeting that decided Labour\u0027s Brexit policy:\u0026nbspThe angry union boss, the archaic rules, the coffee breathLabour conference - LIVE: Keir Starmer receives standing ovation for vowing \u0027nobody is ruling out Remain\u0027 in new Brexit referendumSir Keir\u0026nbspStarmer has received a standing ovation from Labour members after\u0026nbspvowing nobody is ruling out Remain from the ballot paper in a new Brexit vote.The shadow Brexit secretary risked reigniting tensions at the top of the party with the\u0026nbsppromise, which was not part of the pre-briefed speech rubber-stamped by the Labour leadership.Delegates\u0026nbspare due to hold a crunch vote\u0026nbspon Labour\u0027s Brexit strategy later amid splits between the shadow cabinet\u0027s most\u0026nbspsenior figures over whether all options should remain on the table\u0026nbsp- including staying in the EU.Sir Keir,\u0026nbspthe shadow Brexit secretary, told The Independent\u0026nbspthat remaining in the EU could still be on the ballot paper in a Labour-backed referendum, just hours after John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, appeared to rule it out.See below for live updatesPro-Brexit group\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspLeave accused Sir Keir of using his conference speech to undermine Jeremy Corbyn in a veiled bid for the leadership.Describing the shadow Brexit secretary\u0027s comments as a betrayal of the very highest order which would cost the party seats in Parliament,\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspLeave general secretary Brendan Chilton said: Keir\u0027s speech today was a challenge to Jeremy\u0027s leadership.It was a carefully calculated pitch, no doubt written with a team of advisers. He is undermining Jeremy, John McDonnell and millions of\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspvoters, and he knows it.At times the speech had more in common with a leadership stump speech than a policy announcement. Many people will wonder whether Sir Keir is trying to line himself up as the Remain replacement for Jeremy.Speaking in the conference hall, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has outlined a five-point plan to save Britain\u0027s high streets:1. Ban ATM charges and stop Post Office and bank branch closures.2. Provide free bus travel for under 25s.3. Deliver free public Wi-Fi in town centres.4. Establish a register of landlords of empty shops in each local authority.5. Introduce an annual review of business rates and a fundamental review of the whole business rates system.Sir Keir Starmer\u0026nbspalso won a lengthy standing ovation at the Liverpool conference as he said that the option of a Remain choice in a second referendum was not being ruled out.Sir Keir said that if Labour could not secure a general election we must have other options.He said: That must include campaigning for a public vote.It is right that Parliament has the first say but if we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.Sir Keir Starmer said he was \u0027devastated\u0027 by the referendum result as he had campaigned passionately to stay in the EU.\u0026nbspIn a key extract, he said: I know that you want clarity on where we stand on the deal now.\u0026nbspBecause some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain.\u0026nbspSome have said we may support a vague deal – a ‘blind Brexit’ – that gives no detail about the terms of our future relationship. So, let me be very clear - right here, right now:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests – and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.Sir Keir Starmer declined to rule out extending the Article 50 process, under which the UK leaves the EU two years after declaring its intention to quit.Asked whether he could guarantee Britain would leave the EU on March 29, Sir Keir told TalkRadio: Well the answer is it depends, because we don\u0027t know when we\u0027re going to get a deal.The October deadline might slip to November, November might slip to December. I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m not conducting the negotiations so the timeline is not in our control.I don\u0027t think at this stage anybody is talking about extending Article 50 but if it has to be extended quite frankly it will be because of the collapsing failure of the discussions and the negotiations.Sir Keir will give his main conference speech later this morning, where he will announce that Labour is preparing to vote against Theresa May\u0027s deal if it doesn\u0027t meet its six tests.\u0026nbspAsked about the plan by Today, he said: I think it\u0027s going to be a very bad deal, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to meet our tests and we shouldn\u0027t be voting for a deal which we don\u0027t think is in the national interest.He added: We cannot carry on with this idea that the prime minister can bring back any deal that she cobbles together and we must all vote for it however awful it is, because something even worse will happen if we don\u0027t. What is the point? That\u0027s not a meaningful vote.To say to parliamentarians \u0027Well, you can have a vote on this deal, but, by the way, if you don\u0027t vote for it, you\u0027re going to get something much worse\u0027, and there has to be a point where Parliament says it is not good enough.I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a majority in Parliament for no deal, I don\u0027t think no deal is the consequence, that\u0027s why we\u0027re putting other options on the table.Sir Keir Starmer insisted that\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspis coming together over its Brexit approach, as splits over strategy dominated the party\u0027s annual conference.\u0026nbspHe told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: We\u0027ve got a proposition, it\u0027s going to be put to a vote today, there\u0027s going to be unity behind that.\u0026nbspSir Keir also appeared to suggest John McDonnell might have been tired yesterday when he ruled out keeping staying in the EU on the table.\u0026nbspThe shadow Brexit secretary said: To be fair, John (McDonnell) did a number of interviews yesterday and I think you know that he did say later in the day that all options are on the table, so just trying to sort of find this ide between a party which is actually coming together today around a proposition is fine and I understand it.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you all the latest updates from Labour\u0027s annual conference in Liverpool.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/10/07/08/Channel-Tunnel-EPA.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/10/07/08/Channel-Tunnel-EPA.jpg","title":"no deal brexit uk britain eu flights plane green card latest final say pet passport","story":"Created with Sketch.Pet owners who want to take their dogs and cats abroad are warned they would have to register three months in advanceClick to followIndy PoliticsThe threat to flights was attacked as \u0027a bureaucratic nightmare and a farce\u0027Brexit: Flights to be grounded if Britain crashes out of EU with no emergency air deal, government admitsFlights will be grounded if Britain crashes out of the EU next March unless an emergency aviation deal can be struck, the government has admitted.The latest batch of advice papers also warned food producers that pre-packaged products “would no longer be valid for the EU market”, without a separate EU business address.Ministers also told motorists that they would need to apply for a green card as proof of third party motor insurance cover when driving in the EU.And pet owners who want to take their dogs and cats abroad would face the significant inconvenience of having to register three months in advance.Meanwhile, UK hauliers were warned they could be banned from the continent, because they could “no longer rely on automatic recognition by the EU of UK-issued community licences”.The Food and Drink Federation reacted with horror to the technical notices, warning they “lay bare the grisly prospect of a no-deal Brexit”.It urged Theresa May to stop “lecturing the EU” and seek to delay Brexit, by extending the Article 50 deadline, if it could not secure a withdrawal deal “imminently”.Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain, said the threat to flights was “a bureaucratic nightmare and a farce”.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ideInternal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape.

Of course, they’re not.”But the new guidance admits airlines “would lose the automatic right to operate air services between the UK and the EU without seeking advance permission”.The inside story of the meeting that decided Labour\u0027s Brexit policyMPs condemn Labour plan to deny option to Remain in fresh Brexit voteTory Brexiteers are peddling another fantasy with Canada deal ideaA no-deal Brexit could also force passengers to re-screen luggage and go back through security on, for example, a flight to the UK via Paris or Amsterdam.The department for transport said its “preference” would be to agree “a basic arrangement or understanding” with the EU –\u0026nbsparguing Brussels had already said that would be desirable.Alternatively, it suggested “bilateral arrangements between the UK and an inidual EU country could be put in place, specifying the conditions under which air services would be permitted”.Under the pet passports scheme, which involves a rabies vaccination and a microchip, people can take their dogs, cats or ferrets to the EU and back again without quarantine.The technical notice said the UK is pressing to become a “listed” third country after Brexit, to avoid “burdensome” new requirements.But it admitted that designation as an “unlisted” third country would leave\u0026nbsppet-owners having to discuss travelling with their animals to EU countries with an “official veterinarian” months in advance.UK coach operators were advised to consider subcontracting “all or part” of travel on the continent to EU-based operators, because their licences might not be recognised.Jenny Chapman, Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, said: “Today\u0027s Brexit notices underline why no-deal is simply not an option.“The British people will be very alarmed to find out that UK and EU licensed airlines would need to seek new permissions to be able to operate in the event of no-deal.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/15/11/rexfeatures-9070556ap.jpg  width= 2467  height= 1645  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/15/11/rexfeatures-9070556ap.jpg","title":"versace kors sold sale michael latest fashion","story":"Created with Sketch.Purchase of Italian luxury brand follows acquisition of Jimmy Choo last yearClick to followThe IndependentVersace to be sold to Michael Kors, US company announcesMichael Kors has agreed to buy Italian fashion house Versace for $2.1bn (£1.6bn), the US company confirmed on Tuesday. The affordable fashion brand, known for its handbag range,\u0026nbspwill change its name to Capri Holdings once the deal has closed, the firm said.John D. Idol, chairman and chief executive officer of Michael Kors Holdings, said the deal was “an important milestone for our group”. “For over 40 years, Versace has represented the epitome of Italian fashion luxury, a testament to the brand’s timeless heritage. We are excited to have Versace as part of our family of luxury brands, and we are committed to investing in its growth,” he said. “With the full resources of our group, we believe that Versace will grow to over $2bn in revenues. We believe that the strength of the Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands, and the acquisition of Versace, position us to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth.”Confirmation of the sale comes after fans called on Versace to put a stop to the sale. The Italian luxury brand was founded by Gianni Versace 40 years ago. After Mr Versace was murdered in 1997, his family took over the company. The Versace family currently have an 80 per cent stake in the company, while the remaining 20 per cent is held by private equity group Blackstone, which bought into the firm in 2014, with plans to list it on the stock market.However, Blackstone is reported to have found the investment disappointing, and abandoned its plans for a float some time ago.Versace to stop using fur in its collectionsMost people are pronouncing Versace wrongAmerican Crime Story revives fascination in Versace\u0027s deathDonatella Versace, the group’s vice president and chief designer, said: “This is a very exciting moment for Versace.

I am proud that Versace remains very strong in both fashion and modern culture. “Versace is not only synonymous with its iconic and unmistakable style, but with being inclusive and embracing of ersity, as well as empowering people to express themselves. Santo, Allegra and I recognize that this next step will allow Versace to reach its full potential.”Ms Versace added: “We believe that being part of this group is essential to Versace’s long-term success. My passion has never been stronger. This is the perfect time for our company, which puts creativity and innovation at the core of all of its actions, to grow.“Santo, Allegra and I will become shareholders in Capri Holdings. This demonstrates our belief in the long-term success of Versace and commitment to this new global fashion luxury group.”The purchase of Versace is the second major deal announced by Michael Kors in the last 18 months - the company bought shoe designer Jimmy Choo for £921m last year.

Everything was ready, except a small but important detail: Jennyfer’s passport.It is now five months since Jennyfer Avero applied for her travel document. But, until today, the 23-year-old craftswoman from Caracas hasn’t anything about the state of her request.\u0026nbspLast month, her boyfriend Javier left for\u0026nbspEcuador, becoming part of one of the biggest exoduses in Latin American history. And in the meantime, Jennyfer continues to wait, hoping she will join him soon.“I have no alternative,” she says. “I wouldn’t like to leave without a passport.”Venezuela’s intensifying economic and political crisis has pushed hundreds of thousands to flee the country. They are in search of food, security, medicine and jobs.But not everyone\u0026nbspthat makes the decision to leave has a valid passport. Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years, to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however many people come to the headquarters in Caracas hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn\u0026nbspothers, those who came from afar, spent the night here. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.“This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here,” says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of the month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/06/12/delhi-airport.jpg","title":"plane passenger opens door toilet goair india flight delhi patna","story":"Created with Sketch.Police say there was \u0027pandemonium\u0027 when fellow passengers saw the man, a banker in his twenties,\u0026nbsptrying to open the door while the plane was mid-airClick to followThe IndependentFile: An aircraft belonging to GoAir Airlines flies over a residential area in south-west DelhiA passenger flying for the first time sparked panic on a flight in India when he tried to open the rear exit of the plane, mistaking it for the door to the toilet.A police spokesman said the man in his late twenties was seen by fellow passengers, and when challenged he “told them he needed to use the washroom urgently and kept tugging at the exit door”.Cabin crew on the GoAir flight from Delhi to Patna, northeast India were forced to wrestle the man away from the door, according to Indian media reports, and he was persuaded to take a seat for the remainder of the flight before being handed over to airport security upon arrival.A spokesperson for GoAir told The Independent the incident took place on the 1hr 45mins flight G8 149 to Patna on Saturday evening. The plane landed safely.“A passenger was trying to open the rear door of the aircraft while in the air,” the spokesperson said. “A co-passenger raised the alarm and he was intercepted by the crew.

That claim was contradicted by an airline source, who said the doors cannot be unlocked when there is a big difference in pressure between the cabin and outside the plane.CISF escorted the man off the plane upon arrival at Patna and handed him over to local police, who questioned him about his motives.Sanowar Khan, the officer in charge of the local police, said there was “pandemonium” on the plane when the young man, a banker and first-time flier, started trying to open the door.Khan told The  newspaper: “People asked him why he was doing so (trying to open the exit gate). He told them that he needed to use the washroom urgently and kept tugging at the exit door. Pandemonium prevailed amid all this and he was restrained and finally handed over to us.

In Vladimir Oblast, Vladimir Sipyagin beat loyalist Svetlana Orlova by a smaller margin – 57 per cent\u0026nbspto 37.46 per cent.\u0026nbspBut in both cases, few had even predicted a second-round. Fewer still that second-round results would tilt so overwhelming against the ruling-party candidate. On early inspection, it appears the opposition candidates benefited from a surge of tactical voting.\u0026nbspMr Furgal registered 2.5 times the number of votes he received in the first round. Mr Sipyagin,\u0026nbspjust under. On both occasions, the incumbents’ vote stayed flat.\u0026nbspThe results followed a similar story last week when the gubernatorial election in far-east Primorsky Krai was apparently won by a Communist challenger, Andrei Ishchenko. But the victory was snatched at the last, probably by wide-scale election fraud. Mr Ishchenko, incensed, announced a hunger strike the following morning – only to call it off by tea-time following a call from his loyalist leader.\u0026nbspMoscow’s elections chief Ella Pamfilova eventually ruled that election invalid. But she was largely ridiculed for her insistence that the complaints demonstrated fair and competitive elections. \u0026nbspSpeaking with journalists on Monday, spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted the Kremlin has been taken aback by the nature of the voting. Less convincingly, he insisted his boss was only interested in seeing an honest and competitive vote. Rigorous analysis was for another day, he insisted.\u0026nbspThe Kremlin will not have missed the significance of the votes.\u0026nbspWith one exception in 2015, they are the first reverses for the ruling party since direct governor elections returned in 2012. They come at a time that competitive, opposition politics have been eliminated from the country. President Vladimir Putin’s only obvious challenger, Alexei Navalny, left prison on Monday following 30 days of detention, only to be arrested immediately after his release.The pension reform changed everything. The message people are giving Putin is simple: either he returns to the old social contract where he protected ordinary people like them. Or they will react\u0026nbspThose “opposition” parties allowed to compete in Russia’s election system usually play a specific role. The deal is they offer candidates too outrageous or toxic to ordinary voters. Most of the time that has worked.\u0026nbspAgainst the backdrop of the government’s highly unpopular pension reform, voters have looked to give the ruling party a bloody nose wherever they can. And they have voted in masses for the candidate who has the most chance of defeating the party candidate –even if that means voting for the Liberal Democrat Party or no-less reviled Communists.Both the leadership of the LDPR and Communist Party of Russia are loyal to the Kremlin. As such it is unlikely that any of the new governors will make life difficult for the Kremlin.\u0026nbspMikhail Vinogradov, chairman of the St. Petersburg Politics Fund, said the results issued a challenge for the Kremlin and propaganda.\u0026nbsp“The problem is that state propaganda accentuates not so much the positive of government candidates, as much as a thesis that the opposition is worse and weaker,” he says. “That logic is now broken. People are voting tactically. So what can the government do?“The challenge is made more difficult by a more general protest sentiment returning, says Valery Solovei, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. For a while,\u0026nbspanger was directed mostly against the ruling party. Now the anger extends to the man at the very top.\u0026nbsp“The pension reform changed everything. The message people are giving Putin is simple: either he returns to the old social contract where he protected ordinary people like them. Or they will react.”The elections were about more than the victory of LDPR candidates, he says. They described something far deeper – the “moral and psychological condition” of the nation.\u0026nbsp“This is about massive consciousness. Yes, this vote is a protest vote against United Russia. But it’s also a signal for the president. These were his candidates. The Kremlin doesn’t quite understand this yet.

He didn\u0026rsquot explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.\u0026ldquoThroughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remain closely tied to Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US — for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.But her plans were dealt a blow at crunch talks in Salzburg with other EU leaders in September.The PM was ambushed by EU bullies who dismissed her Chequers plan as out of hand.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.Once a deal has been agreed —  ever — MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of Hard Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.The former Foreign Secretary later claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis, Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.Labour MPs have threatened to vote against any deal based on Theresa Mays Chequers plan.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer was expected to address the Labour party conference today .He will say that the plans look set to fail the six tests he set out for any deal with Brussels, according to the BBC.Labour members will then debate and vote on whether all options - including a referendum -should remain open.Their policy is to force an election  MPs are deadlocked over Brexit.But members have managed to get a debate on a fresh referendum on the agenda at the conference in Liverpool.The motion says: If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.Previously, the party said it will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435758175.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit james forsyth","story":"Instead, she is trying to shock the EU into engaging with it by telling them she really is serious about no deal.This is a mighty gamble. The EU know this Government didn’t start properly planning for no deal until this summer.Senior figures there believe the UK will back down rather than go down a route it is so ill-prepared for.So Mrs May is trying to, publicly, burn her boats on the beach.To show that she can’t accept membership of the European Economic Area and the customs union, which would leave the UK as essentially a non-voting member of the EU, or the current Irish backstop, which would see Northern Ireland kept in the EU’s customs union even as the rest of the UK leaves it.One Downing Street source tells me all European leaders say they want an agreement.But a deal isn’t compatible with their Irish backstop proposal. So they’ll have to choose.If the EU doesn’t show any sign of moving in the next fortnight, Mrs May will come under real pressure to change tack from Chequers from her own Cabinet.“The problem is the Cabinet ministers who backed it on the grounds that it was doable,” one Secretary of State tells me. .A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that with the EU rejecting Chequers, Mrs May should turn to a more Canada-style approach — pushing for the free trade deal the EU has repeatedly said is on offer.“There’s an opportunity amid the embarrassment,” one member of this group tells me.No10 rejects this argument, saying a Canada-style deal doesn’t solve the Irish backstop problem.But these ministers think by moving away from Chequers, the UK could create the space for a compromise on the Irish border.Another problem is how blindsided No10 was by the Salzburg snub.This will make it harder for Downing Street to persuade ministers to trust its judgment on what compromises need to be made to get a deal.For instance, Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Europe adviser, wants us to commit to matching EU social and environmental regulations as well as product regulations.This is meant to deal with one of the EU’s objections to Chequers, that the UK could gain a competitive advantage by not following every new EU rule in these fields.But several key ministers have objections to this.They are now less likely to accept this compromise because they are far more sceptical of Robbins’ reading of the state of the negotiations.In the coming weeks, the Cabinet will become more and more assertive.They won’t all be pushing for the same thing — there are those who would prefer a customs union to a Canada-style deal — but they will demand greater input.For they nearly all worry about no deal.One Government source tells me: “We all know what no deal looks like, you can’t blunder into that.”What Mrs May must do in the coming weeks is give herself room for manoeuvre between no deal and signing up to a customs union.She is trying to do that by shocking the EU into engaging with Chequers.But  the EU won’t, then several key Cabinet ministers will push for a new approach ahead of the October EU Council.THERESA MAY has set up a small, kitchen Cabinet to consult on Brexit policy.It met in the first week of September and again on Tuesday this week.This new Cabinet grouping essentially replaces the Brexit inner Cabinet.Mrs May cooled on this Brexit inner Cabinet, which was designed to be balanced between those who campaigned for Brexit and those who had backed Remain, after it objected to her preferred customs plan.I understand that Philip Hammond forcibly made the point that such a balanced committee constrained her options.Those attending this meeting include the increasingly influential David Lidington, Chancellor Philip Hammond, the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, the chief whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who has taken charge of the mission of selling Chequers.In Whitehall, this new group has been dubbed “The Chequers Defence Committee” because of how much of its time is taken up with working out how to sell the Prime Minister’s Brexit proposals.The first meeting included a discussion of whether, and how, ministers should respond to Boris Johnson’s broadsides against Mrs May’s plan.The discussions have also revealed something about Mrs May’s relationship with her own MPs.It was agreed that the PM would meet with a series of Labour Brexiteers – Gisela Stuart, Frank Field and Kate Hoey – in the hope that they might be able to persuade some of her MPs to back her approach.This is quite extraordinary: A PM trying to get opposition figures to persuade her own party to back her plans.CABINET will meet on Monday to discuss Britain’s post-Brexit immigration policy.This is one of the most important decisions this Government will take.So it is absurd that, on Friday lunchtime, ministers still did not have the papers for the meeting.I understand, though, that the Government’s intention is to come up with a system that does not discriminate between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world.However, the UK will be prepared to discuss immigration as part of a trade deal. But this arrangement will not be free movement.Earlier this month, Mrs May told her closest Cabinet colleagues that this is one of the issues she is determined not to compromise on.What is required is an immigration system that encourages the best and the brightest to come here and ensures this country has the workers it needs.I UNDERSTAND there was a plan for Jeremy Corbyn to attend today’s Liverpool match against Southampton ahead of Labour’s conference in the city.But the club didn’t want him on the pitch, so Corbyn won’t get to score at the Kop end.Labour deny that there was any plan for Corbyn to go on to the pitch.IF No10 didn’t have enough to worry about ahead of Tory conference, there is the issue of Theresa May’s voice.She can ill afford a repeat of last year, when it kept giving out during the speech.In an attempt to prevent this from happening, her schedule will be pared right back. Mrs May will do some events designed to encourage more women into politics.But Cabinet Ministers will fill in for her at the ious regional receptions to try to save her voice.Mrs May’s voice isn’t No10’s only concern.One Cabinet minister tells me: “They are completely paranoid she is going to get slow hand-clapped.”This fear strikes me as misplaced.Activists who remember the agony of last year’s conference speech will give her credit for standing up and doing it all over again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Thursday they proved it, with their squalid ambush and the infantile taunting online.Mrs May has always treated EU leaders with respect. But these bullying egomaniacs, these swaggering posers in designer suits, lack the common decency to respect Britain, our Prime Minister and our democratic choice.So yesterday, on behalf of her position and the nation, she bit back. It was the best speech of her le. And her ­arguments were as unassailable as her welcome new tone was hostile.We CANNOT remain part of the EU’s institutions — and make a mockery of the referendum verdict. We WILL NOT split the UK. We WILL NOT annul the Brexit vote because they don’t like it.We CANNOT keep making sacrices and proposing solutions only for Brussels to reject them without any sensible counter offer. That’s not a negotiation.So, as Mrs May says, it’s stalemate. If, as The Sun expects, their response is more of the same, she should tell them this: “Here’s one final offer... not Chequers, but a simple free trade deal, plus security co-operation, that respects our referendum and your principles.“And since Michel Barnier now accepts that technology CAN police borders, let’s use it between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” If they spurn that, we’ll know they aren’t serious.We can leave with no deal, bank our £39billion orce payment and mitigate short-term damage by slashing taxes.We will lure businesses and talent from the continent and embrace those already here, as Mrs May has promised.And we will be free from the clutches of the Brussels club and the posturing pygmies running it.IS anyone more delusional or dishonest than the laughably-named People’s Vote campaign?These Remainiac losers pretend a second referendum is in the nation’s interests when it plainly only serves theirs.To get their way they would risk hideous disorder and the annihilation of trust in democracy. And they are utterly deluded about their chances of victory.Almost all Leavers would vote the same way, alongside many ex-Remainers who know the first vote must be honoured and now see the EU for what it truly is, especially after Thursday.But even  Remain won, why should anyone respect THEIR victory?It would never be sustainable. The fury at an EU which bullied us into a rerun would never subside. Nor would the rage at Remain diehards who ­colluded with Brussels to bring it about.The genie is out of the bottle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Gone,  was the mantra that there is no alternative to the Chequers proposal, which so angered all of us who have campaigned for Brexit.Yet instead, two things emerged. The first that the Prime Minister was clearly angered by their treatment of her.Regardless of their views on Chequers, she has the right to believe that as the UK has always treated the EU with respect, so EU leaders should show the UK the same respect in .Second is what I and others have been saying, that the best and most workable relationship after we leave is one based on a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.However,  we are to reach such an agreement, the EU must recognise that they will have to get rid of the demands for a Northern Irish border backstop, which blocks such a deal.The EU demand that either the UK as a whole stay in the Customs Union or that Northern Ireland is separated from the UK by a customs border is unacceptable and would harm our Union.In fact, a recent publication by two ex-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland shows that there does not need to be a “hard” border with checkpoints or gates, and instead we could have a practical solution where goods flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In fact, such a system should be employed at all our borders around the UK, as this would greatly reduce the likelihood of customs problems at ports from Zeebrugge to Calais.So after months of manoeuvring, and poor advice from advisers in No10, now the choice is at least — and at last — crystal clear.The UK wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU but they need to cease demands about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Failing that, the UK will leave under terms which govern trade between nations around the world.No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal, so the ball is firmly in the EU’s court.By Priti Patel, Tory former Cabinet ministerOUTRAGEOUS, insulting and immature sums up the EU’s appalling behaviour to the UK and to our Prime Minister.These shenanigans from an out-of-touch EU elite serve to demonstrate why Britain was right to vote leave.Who wants to remain in a club where its senior unelected figures mock our great and proud country and shamefully ambush our PM?Not only has Britain bankrolled the EU for the past 45 years, the freedoms and liberties enjoyed by the Continent have been secured by our Armed Forces and the sacrices Britain made in two world wars.While we want to maintain strong, friendly and cordial relations with our friends and partners in Europe, Donald Tusk belittles the PM on social media and President Macron brands those who back Brexit as “liars”.Macron’s undiplomatic comments are an insult not only to the 17.4million people who backed Brexit but to the entire country.Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge.The British people deserve better than the EU humiliating and insulting us.We are a proud nation and will not stand for a Government that surrenders to unreasonable demands from Europe’s unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. This Government has already gone too far, with Chequers offering the EU control over large parts of our law-making.The sad fact about the position the Government is now in is that it was advised to “chuck Chequers” and pursue an alternative course of free and open trade.However, this is not the moment to cower and compromise further.Salzburg should mark the moment when we decide as a country to press ahead with taking back full control over our destiny.Our generous overtures of a £40billion orce payment, remaining an EU rule taker and compromise have been spurned and the EU is resorting to insults.So it’s time the Government realised this and “got real” on Brexit.Britain must take back control of these negotiations and send the EU a signal it will understand loud and clear.We must take the £40billion off the table and remind the EU there are serious consequences to their appalling behaviour and this will hit them hard.If they want to negotiate then we should offer them a take-it-or-leave-it, Canada-plus-style free trade deal, which is an economic prize for the UK and our trading partners.We leave the EU in six months and instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain and let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until now, Jezza — a staunch Bennite eurosceptic — has resisted any move to overturn Brexit. Yesterday, in a remarkable U-turn, he vowed to accept whatever delegates say.So abject surrender to the mob is the price he will pay to destroy Theresa May. “I enjoy being leader,” he said yesterday. “I am carrying on as leader of the Labour Party because I want to win an election.”His persistence in the face of scathing personal ratings is the only glint of sunlight for stricken Tories.Under any other leader, even snooty wannabe Emily Thornberry, Labour would be miles ahead.But we have learned not to underestimate Corbyn.The People’s Vote movement probably has the numbers in Parliament to vote down any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels.These so-called “moderates”, including the slippery Peter Mandelson, leadership flop David Miliband and decrepit Vince Cable, should be careful what they wish for.In normal times, the Tories would beat off the Momentum marauders. But for all her brave talk in Downing Street last week, Mrs May is a real political liability.She destroyed both her credibility and her majority in last year’s unforced contest.The public mood on Brexit is volatile and unpredictable.Most people believe the majority for Brexit, fuelled by EU arrogance and plain bad manners, could actually grow. But nobody’s sure.A snap election would focus the public’s attention on the choice between a clean break and a botched compromise which will never be acceptable to all sides.It could cauterise the issue which still ides families and friends. Or it could backfire badly.Tory Brexiteers must think hard before pulling the plug on the Maybot. It could split their party asunder.But so could Jeremy Corbyn’s rank opportunism.Blairite Labour moderates must soon choose.If they help Jeremy Corbyn win a vote of no confidence, what do they do next?Will they campaign for a party whose rampant extremists wish them dead? Will they stay silent while Momentum activists unseat their moderate comrades?Can deputy Tom Watson support a leader whose own MPs need round-the-clock armed guards against his dangerously fanatical supporters?Can they ignore threats of rape and torture? Nothing is too extreme or too petty for these thugs. They even want ex-Labour luvvie Maureen Lipman sacked from Corrie for attacking their Beloved Leader.Anyone who thinks images of Marxist anarchy are far-fetched should listen to Corbyn sidekick Dawn Butler praising the 1980s Militant Tendency — the forerunner to Momentum — which almost bankrupted Merseyside.“We are in Liverpool where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said, better to break the law than break the poor,” she ranted.That was when Labour split asunder for the first time, creating a new Social Democrat party which posed a short-lived threat the Tories.Roy Hattersley, deputy leader in those turbulent times, warns the party could split again today. “All we need is for one of the hard-working, long-suffering MPs to be kicked out and the whole thing will blow up in our faces,” he said yesterday.The Tories just need to be patient.Albanian drug gangs are gaining market share from Bulgarians, Romanians and Colombians by slashing cocaine prices.Police arrested a record 4,000 peddlers operating across county lines, mostly too young to charge.Kne crime among Somalis, Eritreans and Nigerians is soaring.Meanwhile, there’s a growth spurt in modern slavery.Organised crime is a multi-billion-pound industry affecting “more UK citizens, more often, than any other national security threat,” says the National Crime Agency.All despite Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Deal, or no dough.LABOUR’S position on Brexit is clear as mud, but we know one thing they do believe: the Press needs muzzling.From the moment Jeremy Corbyn told us that “change is coming”, the media has come under attack after attack from a leader who is playing the man — not the ball — when it comes to those asking him legitimate questions.Union strongman Len McCluskey accused the media of “vicious attacks” on the Labour Party.But it’s not an “attack” to ask Corbyn, a man who wants to be PM, why he spent his holidays visiting a terrorists’ cemetery in Tunisia or why he invited the IRA for tea and treats in Parliament.Nor is it just the tactics of the hated “mainstream media” to ask John McDonnell whether his extremist economics will actually work in the real world..Today’s announcement on employee ownership appears appealing for workers, but it would only hit investment and productivity in the long-term.If this Labour Party gains power, the free Press — and the economy — would be in serious danger.IS Anthony Joshua now the UK’s most impressive sportsman?His win over Alexander Povetkin at a packed-out Wembley was stunning.It’s now on to Fury and Wilder.Beat those two, and he might go down as Britain’s best ever boxer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Except, maybe, the rate at which jobs would be destroyed by Labour’s insane Marxist ­programme unleashed yesterday.At the very moment, post-Brexit, when we will need to maximise investment and cut costs for job-creating businesses, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell would declare war on them.His measures to interfere in, steal from or close private firms would be a bullet to the heart of the economy. What sane foreign business would come here or invest here? What sane firm, entrepreneur or inidual talent would stay?His pointless mass renationalisation programme would require debts dwarfing those we have spent nine years painfully reducing. The job-creating miracle since 2010 would be reversed.McDonnell no longer even pretends to be moderate. His is a deranged experiment on the world’s fth-biggest economy. A full-on hard-left revolution. Ask starving Venezuelans how they pan out.But the reason it cuts through is a lack of Tory ideas. McDonnell’s medicine is poison. So what’s Chancellor Philip Hammond’s remedy for our problems?Taxing your fizzy drink at McDonald’s.Mr McDonnell said: “Water bills have risen 40 per cent in real terms since privatisation.“Water companies receive more in tax credits than they pay in tax. Each day enough water to meet the needs of 20million people is lost due to leakages.“With figures like that, we can’t afford not to take them back.”In the small print published by Labour today, the party confirmed that all senior figures at the firms will be put out of a job.They said: “All staff will transfer in the same roles, except for senior executives and directors, whose posts will be re-advertised on dramatically reduced salaries capped by our 20:1 pay ratio policy.”In a chilling warning, Mr McDonnell said that under Labour, the full weight of the Treasury would be used to “take on any vested interests that try to thwart the will of the people”.Michael Roberts, the head of Water UK, said in response: “To replace managers who have decades of experience in running successful water companies, and put much needed investment at risk by handing the industry over to politicians, risks years of chaos in an essential public service.”Mr McDonnell used his speech to officially unveil plans to force all large companies to transfer a tenth of their shares into a fund controlled by employees.He said: We will legislate for large companies to transfer shares into an Inclusive Ownership Fund. The shares will be held and managed collectively by the workers.The shareholding will give workers the same rights as other shareholders to have a say over the direction of their company.And idend payments will be made directly to the workers from the fund. Payments could be up to £500 a year.Business groups have warned that the plan could devastate the economy by slashing the value of companies and discouraging them from investing in improved productivity.Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce said: Let no one be fooled, Labour’s proposals are both a tax grab and an unprecedented overreach into the way many of our businesses are run and will raise serious concerns.At a time of peak Brexit uncertainty, when Labour should be setting out how it will support business confidence and investment, it is announcing policies that would deliver the exact opposite.“The call for wholesale nationalisation could put investment in a deep freeze at precisely the time we want to be encouraging investment in the economy.Economists likened the vow to the Socialist policies of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.And Matt Kilcoyne of the Adam Smith Institute blasted: The Chavez-style commitment to readvertise jobs at utility firms taken back into state control will make the roles political and take people with years of experience and track records of success away from where theyre most needed.CBI head Carolyn Fairbairn said: “Take steps like this and investment will flee our country and the outcome will be one that reduces pay in people’s pockets.”Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “Labour’s plan to put politicians in charge of crucial industries means there would be nowhere to turn when things go wrong.Mr McDonnell opened his speech by suggesting that the anti-Semitism crisis which has gripped Labour in recent months is an attempt to smear Mr Corbyn.He said: They’ve attacked my friend and they’ve attacked him because he stands up for the ideals and beliefs that we all have.I just want to say Jeremy how proud I am of you for the courage and dignity you have shown."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0003707744081.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"otzi mystery tattoos deciphered","story":"Otzi, a frozen 5,300-year-old man, was found in 1991 in a glacier in the Alps between what is now Austria and Italy.Since the discovery, Otzi has been examined by multiple teams of scientists, with new chest tattoos among the more recent discoveries.Some now believe that he may have benefited from a form of prehistoric healthcare after they found tattoo markings they claim are actually acupuncture wounds on his remains.Scientists have previously organised these tattoos into 19 dferent groups, each of which form a set of horizontal or vertical lines.According to Discover Magazine, they cluster around joints and the lower back - where Otzi suffered from degeneration.However, researchers who put forth the acupuncture claim still do not know  the tattoos demarcated the areas for acupuncture treatment, or  they were the treatment itself.It also still remains a theory, as they have noted he had markings across his chest where he suffered no known ailments.Meanwhile, according to Albert Zink of the Institute for Mummy Research in Bolzano, new findings show that healthcare at the time of the iceman was surprisingly well developed.Bolzano scientists found that Otzi, who lived to 40 or 50 years of age, probably had some chronic health problems.A careful study of his remains showed that his teeth were carious, he suffered with stomach ulcers, his joints were worn out and his blood vessels were calcied.Zink claims that Otzi was treated for his medical conditions by prehistoric doctors.Researchers found traces of birch polypore fungi in Otzis belongings which have anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties.They also found bracken which was used to combat intestinal parasites.Upon a more careful study of Otzis body, Zink and his colleagues discovered that the icemans skin was actually covered with 61 tattoos.To make the tattoos, coal dust was rubbed into small wounds similar to the insertion of acupuncture needles, which according to Zink is a time-consuming and skillful endeavour.Earlier this year, experts found undisputed proof that Otzi died from an arrow injury."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436404052.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dan bilzerian parties poolside with tyga and models","story":"The 37-year-old was joined by topless Brazilian model and actress Suelyn Medeiros before going bull riding in the pool.Known as the King of Instagram, Dan was spotted shirtless as he had a bevy of beauties surrounding him.Tyga joined the soiree later in the afternoon and could not stop smiling.Mr Bilzerian hits the headlines for his lavish parties and his antics with scantily claid women.But another side was seen to him during the Las Vegas shooting last year, that killed as many as 59 people and injured more than 500.When warped killer Stephen Paddock, 64, opened fire on a music concert from his hotel window, Dan was in the city at the time.A video circulated of Mr Bilzerian running from the chaos after he allegedly witnessed a woman get shot in the head.Dakota Meyer, the husband of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s daughter Bristol, slammed Bilzerian for fleeing the scene.The decorated veteran, who served in Afghanistan as part of the US Marine Corps, wrote on Instagram: “This is why children shouldn’t classy heroes by their followers or their photos.“@danbilzerian this is what kills me about people like you.

The brain scores of people who did physical activity like swimming and running for 150 minutes a week performed better.Over time, the brain begins to shrink, causing memory failure and personality changes.Dementia is the leading cause of UK deaths and the only one in the top ten without a treatment to prevent, cure or slow it.Its cost to the nation is set to more than double to £55billion over the next 25 years as better treatment for other illnesses leads to longer lespans.A DAILY ten-minute walk may help ward off dementia, say experts.A Calornian study using MRI brain scans found that even mild exercise boosted the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for storing memories.“It’s one of the first regions to deteriorate as we get older — and much more severely in Alzheimer’s disease,” said research co-leader Prof Michael Yassa.It comes as a separate German study showed that 150 minutes of exercise a week can stave off the symptoms of Alzheimer’s.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she implored: “Now is the time to hold our nerve”.The PM was backed by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab straight after the meeting, who dubbed it “a good, healthy discussion”.He added: “The Prime Minister made clear we are going to keep our calm and press the EU on some of the criticisms  they have made.

It’s time to put ideology to one side and listen.”But  pro-EU Tory MPs  stepped up their calls for an alternative Brexit plan at the same time as hardline Brexiteer Tories did. Mrs May’s former policy chief George Freeman joined ex-minister Nick Boles to call for Britain to be part of the European Free Trade association  so it can keep single market access.Mr Freeman said: “There’s a Brexit solution waiting on the shelf.

Lower skilled workers will be granted entry in areas where there are serious labour market shortages that have not been able to be filled from the domestic market – such as in hospitality and construction.The Cabinet victory for Mr Javid was dubbed “a slam dunk” last night, after he won earlier support from the PM for it. Chancellor Philip Hammond made a plea for the Cabinet to give the new system more thought before they made a decision, but he was rebuffed.Business Secretary Greg Clark also insisted on the need to be flexible with Brussels during a long discussion yesterday afternoon.But a Cabinet source said: “There was a little bit of grumbling from the usual suspects, Philip and Greg, but they folded pretty quickly. It was a very well executed operation by Sajid, as he had all the facts on his side.”Mr Javid’s plan was boosted by a presentation to Cabinet yesterday by the chair of the independent Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Alan Manning. The LSE professor repeated his findings from a landmark, year-long report last week that there was little need for low skilled immigration to the UK.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was also said to have taken a dig at Mr Hammond during the No10 meeting.The Sun was told that passionate Brexiteer Ms McVey said to the table: “We’re told by some people that we’re going to have a recession when we leave, and at the same time that we need mass immigration to keep the economy afloat. They can’t both be correct”.Downing Street is keeping the Cabinet’s formal conclusions under wraps so that she can unveil them in her speech to Tory conference next week.But in a strong hint at what we decided, a No10 spokesman said last night: “Cabinet today received a presentation from Migration Advisory Committee chairman Professor Alan Manning.“Cabinet was told by Professor Manning that the MAC was recommending that, in the post-Brexit immigration system, EEA and non-EEA nationals should be part of one universal system.“A key conclusion was that high skilled migration is of greater economic benefit than lower skilled migration, and as such the MAC recommended that the new system should make it easier for higher skilled than lower skilled workers to come to the UK.“The Cabinet agreed that, once free movement is brought to an end, the Government will be able to introduce a new system which works in the best interests of the United Kingdom – including by helping to boost productivity.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also claimed the EU had already offered this more basic approach to a new trade deal.Speaking at the alternative plan’s launch, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “So much of what we hear about these negotiations has been about managing decline, has been about how you have the least bad Brexit, this is about how you can have a fantastic Brexit that sets us up for the next generation and ensures our prosperity.“This has been offered to us by the Commission, they have offered us the best trade deal they have ever done with any country ever in the world, so  you want to call it Canada plus, or super Canada or supercalragilisticexpialidocious Canada, that is what is being aimed and its being offered.”But the plan was overshadowed by a row over why Boris Johnson didn’t turn up at the launch. He was said to have changed his mind at the last minute.Instead he tweeted his support of the alternative plan with another dig at Mrs May.Referring to her speech on Friday calling for the EU to show Britain “respect,” Mr Johnson said of the IEA report: “This is a plan the EU would understand and respect - delivering prosperity for the UK and our European partners. I’ve no doubt it would unite MPs and the country.”But yesterday No10 poured scorn on the plans.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: “In relation to ‘Canada plus’, no EU third country free trade agreement has ever led to a reduction in barriers to the extent that no hard border is needed, and there is no global precedent for an infrastructure-free border without substantial regulatory and customs alignment.”Referring to the EU free trade agreement  with Canada, known as CETA, Mrs May’s spokesman said: “CETA still requires third country customs controls, rules of origin requirements, risk and intelligence-led border checks.“Given a standard free trade agreement could not prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the EU’s position is that their proposed Northern Ireland protocol would come into effect.“So, the FTA would only apply to the Great Britain-EU relationship, with Northern Ireland effectively remaining in parts of the single market and customs union.“The PM has repeatedly set out that we must protect the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom as a whole.” GOT a story?

That seventh ping is almost exactly where the plane is.The northern corridor runs from southern China to Uzbekistan – a zone which spans over 1,400 miles – while the southern arc runs through the Indian Ocean where parts of the plane have been found.Wilsons images from Google Maps show the outline of a large plane in a remote part of southern Cambodia  – which could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.Following the Brits revelation, and with a £53million finders fee up for grabs, a group of experts hired a helicopter to scour the area highlighted by Wilson.However, on September 13, it was reported that the group had failed to find anything in the zone where Wilson believes the plane crashed.The Chinese government also used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area of the south east Asian country.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft.In a tweet, Space View wrote: “Stakeholders and bystanders plead Space View to shoot at the site.So we found out three images, shot in 2015, 2016 and 2018 from our archive.Sorry, no plane

all found among the sunken remains near Cascais, close to the country’s capital Lisbon.The wreck site, which sits about 12m  below the surface, is about 100m  long and 50m  wide.Project director Jorge Freire told Reuters that the wreck was very well-preserved.He said: From a heritage perspective, this is the discovery of the decade.“[It’s] the most important find of all time [for the country].”Finding wrecks off the Portuguese coast is very rare, especially when the objects are this well preserved.The teams say the discovery will shed light on both Portugal’s trading past and Cascais’s place within it.Freire added: “We found the ship on September 4 using a geophysical survey and ers, and spent four days working on the site.”The ship was found while dredging the mouth of the Tagus river, which runs past the resort town and through Lisbon.The mayor of Cascais Carlos Carreiras described the discovery as one of the most signicant archaeological finds of the past decade, the  reported.He said that although the cargo ship had yet to be identied, it could prove signicant to the town.The mayor said: “It’s an extraordinary discovery that allows us to know more about our history, reinforcing our collective identity and shared values.“That, in turn, will certainly make us more attractive and competitive.”In 1994, the wreck of Portuguese ship Our Lady of the Martyrs was discovered near Fort of Sao Juliao da Barra, a military defence complex near Cascais.Our Lady of the Martyrs also sailed the spice route and sank off Lisbon in 1606.According to the survey team, who have been mapping the areas since 2009, the latest wreck is in better structural shape.Minister of Culture Luis Mendes said: For a long time, specialists have considered the mouth of the Tagus River a hotspot for shipwrecks.This discovery came to prove it.The ship was found as part of a 10-year-old archaeological project backed by the town of Cascais, the Portuguese Government and navy, and Nova

tried to sit on the metal bars securing the open window of the Ferris wheel cabin when he slipped out.  Luckily he was caught by his neck and avoided plunging some 131 feet to his death.The heart-in-mouth moment happened on September 24 as the boy and his mum, known as Liu, visited the amusement park.But rather than pay the 30 RMB  on a ticket, she let her son ride alone after he repeatedly nagged her about it, with staff members reportedly allowing the oversight.As the boy’s car, number 18, reached the peak of the city landmark Ferris wheel, screams were heard from the ground as witnesses spotted the boy climbing out the window feet first.The shouting and screaming increased in intensity as the boy’s small body appeared to slip out the window between the metal security bars.Footage shows the boy desperately kicking his legs as he hangs by his neck, with no one in his car to help him back inside.When it became clear that the boy could not be helped, operators let the Ferris wheel continue to turn and waited as car 18 made its way to the ground agonisingly slowly.Staff members and other witnesses immediately rushed to the boy and freed him from the bars when he came within reach, the video shows.He and his mum were taken to the city’s First People’s Hospital, with the child fortunately suffering no serious injuries besides a bruised neck.City officials have reportedly shut down the Ferris wheel operations as investigations into the ordeal continue.A witness was quoted as saying: Children need to be accompanied by adults when riding the Ferris wheel.

ruling United Russia were beaten badly in a pair of regional votes by the crackpot Liberal Democratic Party of Russia .The shock results come amid widespread anger over the government plan to increase the national retirement age.In the far east region of Khabarovsk, the LDPR won the governor’s seat with a massive 70 per cent of the vote while the Putin-backed candidate received just under 28 per cent.The anti-western party also scored an upset in the run-off election for governor of the Vladimir region near Moscow, beating United Russia by more than 20 per cent.Bizarrely in that race, the LDPR candidate Vladimir Sipyagin won despite barely campaigning – such is the growing animosity towards Putin’s regime, reports The Times.The LDPR is led by the eccentric Vladimir Zhirinovsky – described widely as the “clown prince” of Russian politics.In the past, the 72-year-old has urged Putin to drop nuclear bombs on the US-backed Baltic countries and Turkey, with whom Russia has clashed with over the Syrian conflict.During his 1993 presidential election campaign Zhirinovsky pledged to provide free vodka, better lingerie for women and legalise polygamy.He also promised to clone famous Russians such as composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky.In an example of his anti-western rhetoric, Zhirinovsky once threatened to change the gravitational field of the Earth in order to sink the United States of America, reports Vice.In the tirade against the invasion of Iraq in 2002, he called the US a “second-hand goods store” filled with “c**ksuckers, handj*****s, and f***ers.”In 2006, following the poisoning death of Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko in London, Zhirinovsky said: Any traitor must be eliminated using any methods.If you have joined the special services to work, then you should work, but to betray, to run away abroad, to give up the secrets you learned while working – all of this looks bad.Activist and Putin critic Ilya Yashin said the LDPR’s success is directly related to the electorate’s anger towards the government.He said: “People want to get rid of United Russia so badly that they are ready to vote for the representative of a party of clowns.“The people are fed up.”Earlier this month, Zhirinovsky was filmed punching a man in the face at a packed political rally in Moscow.In video footage of the incident, the party leader is heard shouting at a young man: I will punch you and you will bleed” before attacking him.The victim had reportedly called the controversial MP a s***.Zhirinovsky’s son Igor Lebedev, who is an MP for the LDPR, has openly supported the country’s football hooligans in the past.Following the violent scenes at matches involving Russian thugs during Euro 2016, Lebedev said: “I don’t see anything wrong with the fans fighting. Quite the opposite: well done our lads, keep it up!”He made the astonishing remarks while being a member of the Russian Football Union executive committee.According to the FT, he later said: “I don’t think our fans did anything over the top, and you need to understand that, nine times out of 10, football supporters come to a game to fight, and that’s normal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"female dentist bombarded woman medic love letters","story":"Cosmetic dentist Daniella Todorova-Besarbova, 52, was married and had never had a lesbian relationship when she allegedly became fixated with the medic.Cheltenham Magistrates Court heard a stash of pictures of the medic was found on her computer and she had been researching stalking laws when she was arrested.Todorova-Besarbova, from Gloucester, was set to face a two-day trial after pleading not guilty to stalking the married woman, causing her serious alarm or distress.But as the trial was set to begin, the prosecution offered not to proceed with the case when the defendant agreed to accept an indefinite restraining order banning her from contacting her alleged victim.Todorova-Besarbova was told by the magistrates: You cannot make someone elses le a misery again.She replied: I understand.The court was told the stalking campaign lasted for nearly two years, between December 2015 and September 2017.Prosecuting, Matthew Jackson said the pair met professionally in 2014 but Todorova-Besarbova began to pester the medic after she refused to go for a coffee with her.He said: A Facebook friends request then appeared from the defendant to the complainant. Several Facebook messages were also sent by the defendant.On 28th April 2016 the defendant told the complainant she was going back to Bulgaria to get a orce. She asked questions about [the medics] personal le, whether she was happy, etc.She again asked her to go for a coffee with her and this was again declined.Mr Jackson said Todorova-Besarbova saw the medic again on May 13, 2016 and produced a love letter which she handed over for the complainants consideration.The court heard in the letter she said she had agreed orce terms with her husband and would be free in three months, adding I will wait for you.The dentist was said to have written: You are the only person I have ever wanted to spend my le with. I have never been in love with a woman before. You are the first in my le.

It was an apparently ad-libbed line, which did not appear in the original text of the speech approved by the leader\u0027s office. It provoked a deafening roar of approval from the conference floor. Conference delegates agreed a watered-down motion on Sunday night that will commit Labour to considering the option of a public vote on Brexit -  there\u0027s no deal and no general election. The next morning, John McDonnell appeared to suggest any second referendum would be about \u0027the deal\u0027 - hinting remain wouldn\u0027t be on the table. Instead the Shadow Chancellor said: We will be arguing that it should be a vote on the deal itself. And Unite leader and Jeremy Corbyn ally Len McCluskey said: The referendum shouldn’t be on ‘do you want to go back into the European Union?\u0027...because the people have already decided on that.”  But Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir said: The meeting last night was very clear that the question of a public vote should be open. “We weren\u0027t ruling out options and nobody was ruling out remain. And in his keynote speech to party faithful in the main conference hall this morning, he said: We want a general election that can sweep away this failed Tory Government. And usher in a radical Labour Government that would put jobs and living standards first.    But  a General Election is not possible then other options must be kept open. That includes campaigning for a public vote. It is right for Parliament to have the first say but  we need to break the impasse, Labour campaigning for a public vote must be an option - and no-one is ruling out remain as an option. The final passage was not in the text of the speech briefed to journalists as Sir Keir took to the stage.

The election had been due to happen within weeks. But it has now been shelved until a later date after being opposed by allies of Jeremy Corbyn. A local party chief slammed sectarian games as she said Labour needed a female deputy - but due to in-fighting, now was not the time, Angela Marincowitz-Skillen, of Wirral West Labour Party , withdrew the motion just hours before it was due for a conference vote.  She said: There have been some disturbing reports that this rule change has widespread support because those who want to ide our party and undermine Jeremy Corbyn want to use this as a way to do it.

Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer will give the strongest signal yet that he will order MPs to reject the deal in Parliament. Such a vote could spell catastrophic defeat for the Prime Minister - as it would see Labour join forces with Tory Brexiteers in the Commons. Sir Keir today declared that  that happens, on any rational view the government will then have to fall - triggering a general election. And on Tuesday, he will tell Labour\u0027s party conference in Liverpool: Some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain. Some have said we may support a vague deal – a ‘blind Brexit’ – that gives no detail about the terms of our future relationship.  So, let me be very clear - right here, right now: If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests – and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No s, no buts. And  the Prime Minister thinks we’ll wave through a vague deal asking us to jump blindfolded into the unknown she can think again. You can’t meet Labour’s tests by failing to provide answers. We will vote down a blind Brexit. The comments lay down the gauntlet to Mrs May ahead of a crunch vote on her deal sometime in November. Sir Keir has set six tests  that the plan must meet before Labour will back it.  But Labour is still riven with disagreement over whether to back a second referendum on Brexit. Delegates will vote on Tuesday to keep the option of a public vote on the table - not actually back a public vote - after a six-hour meeting ended in a fudge. And a split erupted after Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested any vote wouldn\u0027t have the option of remaining in the EU - only to be contradicted by Sir Keir.

In a few days, Theresa May will be staying at the hotel, which adjoins the conference centre for the annual Tory gathering.  Staff were called and they quickly put on a brave face, carefully covering the eight-legged arachnid creature with a glass. After sliding a card underneath, the scorpion was captured. The RSPCA was then called to find out what to do next. Vic Hurr, an animal collection officer  for the charity, was sent to the hotel - where staff had named the creature Pepe. She put it in a special box to safely transport it to a rescue centre. “The scorpion was only small but he was a feisty little thing,” said Vic. “We think he must have come out of some luggage and probably travelled thousands of miles so he certainly had an adventure.”  The scorpion was taken to a specialist reptile rehabilitation centre by the RSPCA after he was found on Thursday, September 13 and he will eventually be re-homed with a specialist keeper. All scorpions have a venomous sting. But the vast majority of the species do not represent a serious threat to humans.

But six months out from Brexit day it\u0027s looking more and more likely that we won\u0027t get a deal at all. And by the looks of these warnings from the government, that\u0027s going to mean a head-scratching mess of hassle, faff and red tape. Tory ministers today published their final pile of 24 papers, showing what will change for British businesses and consumers in the unlikely event of a no-deal outcome. It could cause havoc with flights and coach journeys and create a massive headache for truck drivers. And taking your pet abroad could mean a visit to the vet FOUR MONTHS ahead of time. Here are the most startling warnings from the final tranche of no-deal Brexit warnings, and what they could mean for you. 1. Taking your pet abroad? You could need to visit the vet four months in advance  The papers reveal a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. Currently, the main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least FOUR MONTHS before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on 30 March 2019 would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November 2018, the papers warn. The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least 30 days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than 10 days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  British airlines hoping to fly planes between the bloc and the UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the latest Brexit technical notices said. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. The notice says: “In this scenario the UK would envisage granting permission to EU airlines to continue to operate. “We would expect EU countries to reciprocate in turn. “It would not be in the interest of any EU country or the UK to restrict the choice of destinations that could be served, though  such permissions are not granted, there could be disruption to some flights.” UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. 3. Planes might be grounded  they fail new safety checks  Planes issued with safety certicates in the UK could be grounded  European officials fail to recognise the accreditation, under a no-deal Brexit. EU officials could decide not to allow British pilots and aircraft certied by the UK\u0027s Civil Aviation Authority to operate in EU skies. Britain has said it would continue to recognise licences and certicated authorised by the Eureopan Aviation Safety Agency. But the technical notice says: “The EU has indicated that it would take a dferent approach to the UK. The information notices issued by the European Commission say that certicates previously issued by the before exit day would no longer be automatically accepted in the system after 29 March 2019.” Pilots and firms hoping to operate in the EU should consult the bloc, the note adds.  Qualications issued by CAA-approved organisations “would no longer be valid for use with EU operators after exit day”, the document warns. UK firms could also be shut out of maintenance contracts and supplying aircraft parts. 5. You might have to go through airport security TWICE  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport before changing flights for an onward destination would be screened in Britain as now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says the Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” 6. Truck drivers will need new permits - and there almost certainly won\u0027t be enough to go around  Thousands of truck drivers could be locked out of EU countries as their permits to carry freight across the continent become null and void. If there\u0027s a No Deal Brexit, UK hauliers will no longer have the automatic right to be let through EU nations\u0027 borders under the current permit system. Instead,  no other deal comes into force, they have to apply for an \u0027ECMT\u0027 permit - and there are only a set number of these available per year. For one type of these annual permits, just 984 are issued per year, the documents say. The no deal papers warn explicitly that demand for the permits will signicantly exceed supply and firms should prepare for getting fewer than they ask for. They will be allocated through a formula that was laid down in law earlier this year, and successful applicants will be contacted at the end of 2018.

Too often we see boarded-up shops and units sitting empty or independent local businesses priced out, victims of soaring business rates, rent hikes and undercutting by online retailers. The Government’s decision to hike business rates following the 2017 revaluation left many small, independent companies lumbered with extortionate bills they simply cannot pay.

Research shows one in four toddlers in the UK refuse food every day but biochemist Dr Gill Hart claims parents should not automatically assume youngsters are being ‘picky’. Dr Hart, scientic director at Yorkshire food intolerance testing firm YorkTest, believes a young child refusing to eat certain foods may be their way of communicating an underlying intolerance which they can’t express in words.  She sad: “It’s important parents realise that a fussy eater can sometimes have underlying food intolerances .  A child can lose their appetite because they may not be able to articulate to their parents that they are getting tummy pains.  And  a child does complain of having a sore tummy, it’s very dficult for the parent to recognise that this may be caused by the food they are eating. “Also, quite often a child might call their symptoms tummy pains, when they are in fact suffering bloating or bowel problems.” Research suggests some of the most common food intolerances are reactions to dairy products, chocolate, eggs, food additives, strawberries, citrus fruits and tomatoes. Symptoms include tummy pain, bloating, wind, diarrhoea, skin rashes and even itching. Food intolerances are dferent to allergies, which affect the body’s immune system and often cause almost instant reactions. In contrast, intolerances can take 72 hours to appear, making it very dficult to pinpoint the offending food. Dr Hart warns that just because a child doesn’t experience a gut reaction to a food doesn’t mean they are not having a reaction to it. The effects of a food intolerance can be wide-ranging.  She says it’s all down to the food-specic IgG antibody, which YorkTest measures to determine reactions to possible problem foods, revealing: “If you have got any sort of imbalance, the reactions you get with an IgG reaction can cause inflammation and the inflammation could then cause a range of problems in dferent parts of the body. “It’s not necessarily related to the gut. It depends on that person’s makeup. “And when the trigger food is removed from a child’s diet, the ‘fussy’ child could then develop a healthy appetite because he or she is not frightened about eating foods that result in tummy ache. “In a sense, you can ‘grow out of’ a food intolerance. Once the food has been identied as a problem, the first step is to remove the food that’s causing the inflammation, because it could be presenting a range of dferent symptoms.  “And our nutritional therapists can work with people to help heal their guts, frequently using probiotics that can reinoculate the gut with lots of good bacteria. “They can also offer things like digestive enzymes which can really help you break down your food properly. “And then, once you have removed the foods that are triggering the reaction and you look after your gut as well, you may start to tolerate the foods which have previously caused problems. “For me, it’s all about choice. With the right information, people have the knowledge of what works for them and what doesn’t. “It is then a balance between the reaction and the impact it has on you.” Figures released by Allergy UK in 2009 estimated as many as 45 per cent of Brits could be affected by food intolerance. ow’s milk is one of the most common childhood food intolerances.

Nigel Hurst, who survived kidney cancer despite being given 12 months to live 15 years ago, tragically took his own le after one missed council tax bill grew to \u0026pound1,500 and then spiralled out of control. He wrote a suicide note to his children hours before bailfs were due to evict him and repossess his house, which he had been living in without heating or water as he could not afford it. And he posted on Facebook: Goodnight sweet world. Daughter Jessica Hurst had been scrolling through her feed during a break from opera rehearsal when she saw the message from father Nigel and paused. She thought it was odd and commented Have you been hacked? Lol and went back to practise. However, hours later when she checked her phone again she saw missed calls from her mother and grandmother. She rang her mum back, who told her: Your dad\u0027s gone.  Jessica, 25, collapsed onto the floor. Her 56-year-old father, who lived in Lindale, Cumbria, had killed himself as could no longer go on. He had left notes in the house, including one at the bottom of the stairs for the bailfs telling them which room he was in. Nigel also left letters for daughters Jessica and Sally, 20. They had no idea of the extent of his money troubles as he had hidden it from them. Jessica bravely shared the note in a plea for more humanity from debt collectors. “It breaks my heart to write this. I love you with all my heart, wrote Nigel, who loved the community he lived in and would organise events such as bonfires and barbecues. I have been so unhappy in my personal le for so long, I cannot go on. Now I am about to lose my house as well as my self respect, I have decided to go.” He added: “Do not grieve for me for long. Passing for me will be a huge relief. I love you both and will always be with you.” Now Jessica is speaking out to highlight her dad\u0027s tragic case as she also wants to help others. She said: No young person should be left without their father because of a few thousand pounds of debt.  Recalling the moment she visited her father\u0027s house following his death in October, Jessica was told by a bailf You\u0027ll be shocked, reports the BBC . Inside she found bankruptcy letters, court letters and other notices on table tops, kitchen surfaces and stuffed in plastic Co-op bags. She told the BBC: Until he died I hadn\u0027t realised my father had been in debt, let alone declared bankrupt. Three days earlier he had dropped me off in Glasgow and helped me move into a flat, ready to start the second year of my master\u0027s degree. He had stayed with me all day, helping me to unpack, and called me three times on his journey back home. It was the last time I saw him. She later found out that Nigel, who acted as an agony aunt to pals, had been living without water or heating as he could not afford it. Nigel\u0027s money problems began in 2008. It started off with \u0026pound1,500 debt owed for council tax to South Lakeland District Council. Over time it spiralled to \u0026pound72,000 due to interest, agent fees and legal costs. In total he owed more than \u0026pound9,300 to the council. He was also declared bankrupt. The rugby fan never disclosed his money problems to his daughters as he was a private man, and Jessica believes her father would have seen asking for help as being a failure.  A coroner in March ruled Nigel\u0027s death on October 4 was suicide. Jessica said: “This debt pushed my father in to taking his own le. It is utterly disgusting and inhumane. The amount of pressure that had put on him was unbearable. No human being was going to withstand that as well as having cancer. It is just not fair.” She added to the BBC: I understand that my dad didn\u0027t reply to the council\u0027s letters and that must have been frustrating. But  a client has been a good citizen, paid his council tax all his le and then suddenly stops, there must be something wrong. I believe that in those circumstances the council should try to reach out to that person. Jessica believes her father was failed by the council and thinks it should have done more to help him, rather than just continue to send letters. She says the first person to turn up to his house and talk about the money he owed was a bailf. The council says it did not have a telephone number for Nigel to talk to him. The debt has since been reduced, but student Jessica and her unemployed sister do not have the money to pay it and know their family home will be sold.

The 34-year-old penned a heartbreaking letter from prison - saying she \u0027just wants to come home\u0027. The former shop worker from Hull was jailed on Boxing Day last year for carrying hundreds of painkillers in her suitcase. She hoped the Egyptian appeal court would accept that she had no way of knowing the tramadol pills were banned.  But she was left in tears after judges in Cairo upheld her conviction and three-year prison sentence, The Sun reports .  Laura\u0027s Egyptian husband Omar Saad, 34, broke the news to her inside the notorious Al Qanater prison, where she is living in a squalid cell with 20 other women in 34C heat.   In a handwritten letter, given to The Sun , Laura said: I was sure they would see sense. This whole situation is just ridiculous. I just want to come home.  She also hit out at the UK Foreign Office, who she says refuses to intervene on her behalf. She added: How can they leave me in here? Laura was sentenced to three years in prison for carrying 290 tramadol tablets into the north African country while on holiday in October 2017. She was arrested and charged despite her pleas that the painkillers were for husband Omar’s bad back.  Speaking to The Sun, Laura said: What don’t these people get? I wonder  I’ve died and this is hell. What did I do that was so wrong in my le to end up here? I thought the appeal judges would see sense and realise I couldn’t have known the tablets were banned. It’s just so absurd.  Her older brother Kirk recently told of the “emotional rollercoaster” the whole family have been on since she was imprisoned. In an interview with Viking FM, Mr Plummer said: “I wouldn’t wish what me and my family are going through on anybody, nobody. “No one wants to see their daughter or sister in prison and  it happened to them then they would realise just how bad it is.  “But what we are going through is nothing compared to what Laura is going through in prison out there. “You sometimes just sit and think and it hits you again that she is still there and as a family we are trying to get on and lead a normal le but it’s hard and you are constantly reminded that she is still there with 20 other women sat on a cell floor. “The last six months have been an emotional rollercoaster and you get ups and downs. “One minute you are angry she even went to Egypt and then you get mad that she’s been arrested for what she did.”  Shortly into her imprisonment, one of Laura’s sisters, Jayne, revealed how Laura had been “kicked and punched” in jail and said she would be “amazed”  her younger sister survived her three-year ordeal.

Clara Malagon, who had been struggling with self doubt and bouts of depression for some time, had been on-duty on the night of the atrocity. She witnessed first-hand horric injuries sustained by the young victims, but the 22-year-old successfully underwent counselling and had a detailed debrief about the bombing with senior doctors afterwards. However, in July last year just seven weeks after the tragedy, Miss Malagon was found hanged at her Manchester city centre apartment.  It is not known why she killed herself. An inquest this week heard Miss Malagon from Twickenham, south west London had completed a degree in nursing at Manchester University and became a critical care nurse at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 2016. She was a keen rower and enjoyed cycling, running and walking and also played the viola and took up ballet and flamenco dancing. But Miss Malagon also suffered bouts of depression and self doubt and had been prescribed the antidepressant Citallipram.  Her father Dr Ignacio Malagon, a consultant anaesthatist at Wythenshawe Hospital wept as he told the Manchester hearing: She was physically quite tough but she was seeing her GP for mental health issues - we talked about it regularly. She was good at taking instructions from her GP and we talked about counselling. Out of the blue she started crying at university, she would come to me but I couldn\u0027t give her professional advice so I advised her to go and talk to someone. She went to counselling organised by university - everything was going well so she came off the medication. But in January last year she started crying again, and she said to me \u0027Dad, I need help.\u0027 After she had been to the GP she was told it was going to be three months before she was going to get any counselling, she said she couldn\u0027t wait for three months and said she wanted to go private.  She found one counsellor but she didn\u0027t like them. We were talking about money and I offered to help her out. I gave her some money to pay for the first few sessions and she found one she did like. She was able to organise the counselling herself. She said she was happy with the lady she found. He added: Clara was a staff nurse but she had done a training course in intensive care. She was on duty in May last year during the Arena attack. It was traumatic for her and I rang her, I was in hospital too, and I said to her: \u0027Are you OK?\u0027 And she said: \u0027Yeah Dad, it\u0027s really tough, I\u0027ve seen some of the kids didn\u0027t make it.\u0027 We had a long chat and I said to her that I realise this is very traumatic for her and  she was upset then she should tell her seniors, or  she felt unwell she should tell her managers. I just said to her not to worry and that it was going to be fine.  A few days after there was a debriefing provided by the MRI. She rang me afterwards and said there had been 50 people there including her seniors and management. Everyone there told how wonderful the team had worked and she was delighted. We talked on a regular basis, either over a glass of wine or dinner. If she had an issue she would talk about it to me in a professional manner  it was to do with work. I was involved  she wanted to talk about anything. She would tell me about the patients she helped, she never said she felt understaffed or overworked. She shared everything with me. I had a very good relationship with my daughter.  When she felt stressed she would share it and talk with me. In the weeks leading up to her death, there were none such conversations. On the weekend before she was due to come for her dinner. She said she was on the train and she was very busy with things and she had been visiting a friend in London - there was no dference in her at all. Miss Malagon\u0027s flatmate Grace Callaghan who found her friend on her  home from work said: She had said to me she was feeling low and she made an appointment with her doctor to prescribe some more antidepressants. \u0027But that weekend we said we would have to have a curry night as we had not seen each other properly. She was one of the loveliest people I ever knew - on the night before there wasn\u0027t any concern about her. GP Dr Gill Aitken said Miss Malagon had been prescribed Citrallipram but in September 2016 she came off it and finished her nursing degree.  In a statement Dr Aitken said: She came back to me and said she was feeling low and crying, and feeling apathetic. Whilst there was no trigger, I believe this was work related. She was anxious about work, she had her own self doubt and confidence issues and she said she wasn\u0027t sleeping. But she denied any suicidal thoughts. She said she wanted some medication and I suggested a review in two weeks time, which she did. She said she had been back to Spain for a few weeks but she felt upset and felt guilty for not being a happy person to be around at the time. She had contacted a Manchester self help group. I asked  there were any issues at work and she said there had been some complex patients. She said she had no suicidal thoughts. She told me her family were a strong protective factor for her. I told her who to contact  she felt in crisis and said  she needed anything she could make an emergency appointment with the team.  Police examined Miss Malagon\u0027s iPad and laptop but found no evidence she would take her own le - with one message to a friend in a social media chat saying she had a successful counselling session. Recording a conclusion of suicide, Coroner Andrew Bridgman said: Clara had her full professional le ahead of her. Her father has told me that she was a fit and active young woman who had lots of hobbies. But it is clear from the evidence that she had mental health issues from around 2016 which correspond with her final year of her degree. She was on medication for around 6-7 months, to which she came off it and appeared to be fine. However this resurfaces towards mid June 2017 - three to four weeks following the Manchester Arena tragedy when she was on duty. It clearly had some effect on her however I have had a discussion with her father, and there was no specic reference to the trauma of the events of that night. She sought therapy and she did take private counselling, and found this helped her. Clara did intend to take her le but this inquest cannot answer why.

Lisa Stout spotted the elusive beast by simply trawling through Google Earth shots taken three years ago.  The startling discovery has now been accepted as the ninth sighting of the monster this year by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register - and highlights the lasting interest in the mythical creature.  Ironically the 31-year-old from Bellevue, Ohio, has a monster - Bessie - on her doorstep, but has never seen it. According to Google there are 200,000 searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster.  As a result of a recent loss of employment, I\u0027ve had a lot of time open up. I had been searching for Nessie on/off for the past few weeks, spending an hour or so a week on Google Earth as well as other places I like to visit in the App, said Ms Stout, a mother-of-one. I had seen some of the latest Nessie sightings and thought that I can definitely find a better image of her than that which I used for motivation to challenge myself to find her! Last Thursday at 9.45am, I had got my daughter off to school and began to search for Nessie when I noticed a cluster of pictures taken by an Underwater Earth Contributor all in one area near the Loch Ness Highland Resort in Fort Augustus. I noticed what I believe may be the creature known as Nessie - or at the very least what makes up for most of the accounts of Nessie sightings that residents/ tourists are seeing and reporting.  Ms Stout said she believes the dark figure protruding from the water is at least three to five feet tall which I believe to be is Nessie\u0027s neck and it also appears rather flat giving the neck a width of at least one foot. It looks like the inner part of the neck and at the top there is a glare on the right side of what appears to be her head but on the left side there may be evidence of an eye and partial lining of the mouth, she said. I was unsure at first  what I was seeing was a right side \u0027fin\u0027 in the image but now I more so believe that it may be more of the \u0027main body\u0027 that you can see along the surface of the water. There appears to be a large crease in her neck and skins appears rough/ scaly whereas the rest of her body appears smoother. I have heard the story about the Loch Ness Monster almost as far back as I can remember. I hope this image will help keep her story alive as I believe her existence will plague the imagination of several generations of people to come.  We live very close to Lake Erie where I often like to scout for the Southern Bay Bessie Monster... but Bessie seems to be a lot more shy then Nessie! It is not the first time internet sleuths have used Google to unearth Nessie. Google Maps footage of the Loch Ness Monster was previously discovered by users searching on street view. Map users are convinced the image, which portrays a long humped figure, is the famous creature. The long, narrow shape and four humps visible above the water\u0027s surface are consistent with previous sightings of the monster. Nessie enthusiast Bjarne Sj strand noticed a long, thin object in the water on Google Earth while on his computer 800 miles away in Sweden.  The then 52-year-old, who has never even been to Scotland, won the best Loch Ness Monster sighting of 2014, in an annual competition run by William Hill bookies. Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year - thanks to the internet. Nessie\u0027s official recorder said the 11 accepted sightings in 2017 spanned the planet. In June last year a Canadian woman also took two videos from the Loch Ness Webcam while watching the water from more than 5000 miles away. An increasing number of sightings are now online from people all over the world, said Gary Campbell, the recorder and keeper of the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register. Mr Campbell said two of last year\u0027s sightings were also by webcam, including one from an online watcher in America.

The rear of the building, on Yeaman Shore, would also be remodelled to create an entrance.Internally, the building would have 102 underground car parking spaces.The ground floor would contain the auditorium, a bar, toilets and ticket office.There would be further bars and balcony spectator seating on the first floor, while the second floor would have a corporate dining area and upper deck seating.Architect Kenny Stephen said: “We were commissioned to do a feasibility study to see how a 5,000 to 6,000-capacity venue could be realised.”Mr Stephen said redeveloping the Mecca Bingo building would be cheaper than building a new concert hall from the ground up.He said: “It makes more sense than building from scratch.“Bingo seems to be in decline, with more people playing online, so it may be another use for the building.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"as it happens falkirk v dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSecond-half headers from Pavol Safranko and Craig Curran see the points headed back to Dundee.Dundee United laboured for much of the first-half but opened the scoring in the second 45 through Safranko\u0026#8217s header from a Fraser Aird delivery on 59 minutes.Curran made it two on 86 minutes as he flicked a lovely looped header over the Bairns\u0026#8217 goalkeeper Leo Fasan from Yannick Loemba\u0026#8217s cross.The win sees the Terrors move up to third in the Championship \u0026#8211 just two points behind leaders Ayr United.Full match details in the live blog below.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann has three games to save his job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPatience is wearing thin with the Dundee hierarchy and manager Neil McCann has just three matches to save his job.The Tele understands the Dark Blues boss has until the next international break to turn his side’s fortunes around.However, a heavy loss to Hibs today followed by defeat to Hamilton next week could accelerate that process.The Tele also believes there is appetite for change at Dens and owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms have been urged to sound out potential successors to McCann.However, the key decision-makers at the club are prepared to give the current gaffer more time to get the results that could kickstart the Dark Blues’ season.That patience will only last so long, though.Next week’s trip to Hamilton is followed by a home game against Steve Clarke’s Kilmarnock before the Premiership takes another break with international football taking over.By then, results are a must  Neil is continue in his role as manager.Meanwhile, the Dens gaffer will be hoping for a midfield boost today against Hibs.Glen Kamara has missed almost the entire season, starting just the opening Betfred Cup group stage win over Stirling Albion and the 1-0 defeat at St Johnstone three weeks ago.The Finnish international injured his ankle after that victory in Stirling and has struggled on with it since.He suffered a recurrence a fortnight ago as he prepared to travel to join up with his national side and then missed last week’s trip to Ibrox.He has, though, ed to training this week and is hoping to be fit enough to play a part against the Hibees at Dens today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Jock-McInnes.jpg ","title":"dundee charity worker climbs romanias tallest mountain in his kilt for local boy lloyd","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee charity worker climbed the tallest mountain in Romania recently wearing a kilt to raise funds for a local boy undergoing treatment for a rare disease.Jock McInnes, who works in the city and lives in Perthshire, is hoping to top £1,500 in funds after his epic tartan-clad trip.He’s raised more than £2 million for charities and has taken on some of the most treacherous adventures all in the name of good causes.The 62-year-old’s latest challenge saw him scale the 2,544m Moldoveanu Peak.He is raising money for his nephew’s son, Lloyd Penman, 2, who suffers from an extremely rare condition – STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy.Jock said: “Lloyd is a wonderful lovely little boy and it has been such a hard time for the family.“It is a very rare disease and the money raised will help.

I am not a player made for playing without any pressure because then I wouldn’t be playing well.“I need pressure to thrive and it’s a big club – it should be in the Premiership.“It’s about how we deal with the pressure and Dundee United is probably the team with the most pressure on it in this league.“You feel like the fans definitely want to get out of the Championship. I want to get out of the Championship as well.“I’m not coming here to play my two seasons on my contract in the Championship.“It’s going to be a tough game and, in this league, every game is tough. It’s not because they are bottom of the league that we should underestimate them.“They have a new coach and they showed last week they played very good in the first half and the thing is they have nothing to lose, we have everything to lose.“You see in this league there is not one game you can predict. Everybody can beat each other.”After disappointing draws against Alloa and Morton in recent weeks, Frans knows there can be no more excuses.He has captained the side in the absence of the likes of Fraser Fyvie and Stewart Murdoch and feels they are now more equipped, with their ‘leaders’ coming back to the squad, to go on a winning run.“If you look at the way we played last weekend, we had 11 players starting who weren’t here last year but still we produce some good stuff,” he added.“We need to be more efficient. We missed a few chances but also we concede every game.“I do think we defend well but somehow we concede a penalty and the week before it was a free-kick against Alloa.“It is not because of bad defending, just small things, and we need to get better at them.“I think you see every week we are improving but, OK, there comes a time you need to put it in results and start to go on a run.“You see Fraser Fyvie coming back, Billy King, Sam Stanton is still injured, Murdoch is out.“These are players who would walk into a lot of Championship teams and be the leaders.“There are positive things to look forward to.”United will go toe-to-toe with pointless bottom side Falkirk today on an articial surface.However, Frans says they will not be using that or the ongoing stormy weather as excuses for another disappointing display.“I don’t like to talk about the pitch because I don’t want to have any excuses. Whatever pitch it is we should play well.“We went to Queen of the South and I think the first half we produced one of the best performances since I’ve been here.“You come up against dferent circumstances and maybe it’s going to be 100mph wind.“Every week it’s something so  you think too much about circumstances you are not focused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"falkirk boss ray mckinnon looks ahead to clash with old club dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon accepts there will be an added dimension to this weekend’s game against old club Dundee United because he is only “human”.However, the Falkirk manager is adamant his sole focus will be on trying to land a first league win of the season for his new team.McKinnon will be facing United for the first time since being sacked by the Tangerines in October last year.He was axed just 10 games into the season with the Tannadice outfit in fourth place and just five points off the top of the Championship.He said: “I’m treating it just as another game but I am human, so I am naturally going to look at all the scenarios.“However, the focus will definitely be just on us and making sure we are set up properly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9a3066643d7.jpg ","title":"folk from across the world coming to dundee to learn about va and waterfront","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn international delegation of design cities will descend on Dundee next month to discover the story behind the new V\u0026ampA museum and Waterfront regeneration.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander confirmed representatives from the 20 Unesco Cities of Design, which include Beijing, Buenos Aires, Bilbao, Turin and Berlin, will visit Dundee for at least three days from October 17.It is seen as a major coup for the city, which had to beat off competition from two other prominent European locations.Mr Alexander said: “There was a real interest in coming to Dundee and seeing it first-hand because they’ve heard so much.

For the branch he works in takes him hundreds of miles each day.His distinctive Royal Bank of Scotland mobile branch is one of a fleet notching up 8,000 miles a week between them, stopping at over 440 communities.It’s a journey that has taken him to parts of Scotland he would never otherwise have been lucky enough to see, to spend time forging relationships with people he’d almost certainly otherwise never have met.“Everywhere I go I meet lovely people who really value the service we provide,” says Norman .“What we do is so well received, that I don’t really notice the miles I travel. I thoroughly enjoy it and I know the people I meet really appreciate it.”Royal Bank launched the world’s first mobile bank branch seven decades ago. It had humble beginnings, housed in an American Studebaker truck left over by the US Army after the Second World War – it brought banking services via its affiliate bank, National Bank of Scotland, to personal and business customers on the islands of Lewis and Harris.More than 70 years on and mobile branches are more relevant than ever, helping to create banking services in all corners and communities of Scotland, providing support for customers who need help with online services and bringing the personal touch to those who prefer the ‘face to face’ experience.According to Norman who has been working with the mobile service for seven years, this person-centred approach is at the heart of his role. “Customers are at the heart of what we do as a bank” he points out. “So we do everything we can to put them first.”The customers he encounters during his travels cover all generations, and have a wide range of needs – busy parents, teens leaving home for the first time or customers with mobility issues who cannot get into a branch.With Norman in the driving seat and a colleague by his side, his Royal Bank van – with its distinctive livery and secure customer counters inside – hits the road five days a week with a timetable that takes in parts of Argyll and Stirling, West Dunbartonshire and Lanarkshire.Geography plays its part. Sometimes the distance between communities means there are three stops a day, on other days the mobile unit can fit in eight stops.The mobile branch service is, of course, at the mercy of traffic and road works, but the bank makes sure customers are never left in the dark. “We know who our regular customers are so  there’s a delay we get in touch and let them know.”It’s an example of the attention to detail that goes above and beyond what some might expect and is why Norman’s customers can be protective of the Royal Bank service.Customers with mobility issues in particular are given extra consideration. “We give them a little token that they can use to let us know they are outside,” says Norman.“We pop out to help them so they don’t have to worry about trying to get inside.“One customer had mobility issues but always made the effort to get to the service.“When we discovered she could no longer manage to come to the van we arranged to make a special stop at her house.”Royal Bank mobile units are equipped with a satellite dish which provides an internet connection, and iPads which enable staff to help customers access online services, plus the leaflets, forms and paperwork found in a typical high street branch.“We can provide the help they need to access the right information and support,” Norman adds.The mobile units are just one of the many ways customers can access banking wherever they may be.Royal Bank community bankers provide support in venues like libraries and leisure centres while many Post Offices offer banking services and customers can access their finances easily using phone banking, apps and online services.“The mobile bank I drive is very dferent to the one my predecessors drove 70 years ago.“So is the way people like to bank. Even 10 years ago people couldn’t bank using a mobile app.“But it all has one thing in common – to give customers choice and to offer them the best possible service.”Search Royal Bank Ways to Bank: personal.rbs 100vw, 350px\" /\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/KMil_Penguin_Auct-17.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"here is how much each maggies penguin parade statue sold for at the public auction in va dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn incredible £540,000 was raised for Maggie\u0026#8217s at a public auction at the conclusion of the popular Penguin Parade.A packed audience at the V\u0026ampA gasped in delight as the £539,000 total was announced following frantic bidding for the 82 lots on offer.A donation of £1000 from the floor rounded the total figure to the fundraising target of £540,000 \u0026#8211  meaning which is the costs to run Maggie\u0026#8217s Dundee for a year.P-Pick Up The Phone Penguin was the highest-selling figure going for an incredible £11,000.Judy Murray snapped up Andy Murray-themed Don for £10,000, while the Dundee and United penguins went for £5k and £6, respectively.Here is what each penguin sold for:1 Bonnie Dundee £6,5002 R2DunDee2 £5,5003 Mr Sofishticated £4,0004 Blue Planet Penguin £6,0005 Bagpipes \u0026amp Flippers £9,0006 Engullfed £5,0007 Sid the Penguin £9,0008 Charles £10,0009 Gothamatryoshka £5,00010 Don £10,00011 What Lies Beneath £7,00012 4 Seasons in One Day £5,50013 Heat Reactive Hue £4,00014 I Choose Dundee £7,00015 Dundee Star’s Penguin £6,00016 Absent Penguin £5,00017 Pinguis Anatomica £4,50018 Punky Penguin! £7,00019 Dundee United FC Penguin £6,00020 Sunrise £7,00021 Pen Broon £5,50022 Emperor’s Voyage of Discovery £8,00023 Dazzle Penguin £5,50024 Peter Panguin £7,00025 Pluguin £6,00026 The Store Hus Pingvin £3,50027 Penguinstein £6,00028 Journalism £10,00029 Old Tom Morris £7,00030 Penguin Street £6,00031 WellBEEing £7,00032 Capguin Scott £5,50033 Pop and Pip £9,00034 “PJ” The Poetry Penguin £6,00035 I Believe I Can Fly £10,00036 Fish Food £4,50037 Lord P.

The developer, Dutch property firm Vastint Hospitality, could not be contacted.A y Inverness debate ended on Tuesday with an 8-7 vote to refuse the application despite Ness-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam\u0027 insistence that the vision was that of \"a grand building, that you\u0026rsquod expect to see in a serious city centre\".Inverness Central ward party colleague Richard Laird, however, successfully argued that it \"failed to make a positive contribution to the city\u0027 architecture,\" and therefore contravened the local plan.He described the design as \"absolutely bogging\" and \"exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to tear down in the middle of Inverness\".He and several committee colleagues were also concerned about the potential impact of future traffic movement in Waterloo Place and Glebe Street as a result of the proposed development.There was general support for a hotel to be built at the location but Cllr Laird said the drawing board proposition \"looks exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to teardown in the middle of Inverness\" \u0026ndash a reference to the council\u0027 recent approval for bulldozing and replacing the \u0026lsquo60s-built Bridge Street \"blots on the landscape\".Committee colleague Bill Lobban considered the hotel design \"hideous\".He said: \"It\u0027 the most visible site in the whole of Inverness. It\u0027 a very important site but it deserves something better than this. This Lego-style block might have been contemporary in 1960s East Germany looking from the wrong side of the Berlin Wall.\"Echoing that, Councillor Andrew Baxter said he had seen similar \"Stalinist\" architecture in Moldova.Peter Andrews, managing director of Vastint Hospitality, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore disappointed. We want to wait to see the council\u0027 written reasons for refusal.\u0026ldquoWhen we\u0026rsquove had a chance to review it with Keppies and probably a planning consultant then we\u0026rsquoll decide what we\u0026rsquore going to do.A spokesman for Keppie Design said: \"We\u0026rsquore naturally disappointed by the narrow decision to refuse planning permission for the scheme as it stands, despite officers recommending approval.\"The design is an honest, contemporary response to a high-profile site, using a selection of high-quality materials and massing relevant to the hotel use.\"The detail of the aesthetic and the proportions of the design have been signicantly remodelled following several post-submission meetings with the planning authority.\"Former Highland planning chairman Thomas Prag, who opposed a previous development proposal for the site while a serving councillor, said he was \"relieved\" his successors had done the same.\"I\u0026rsquom disappointed with the architects, who are well known and do some great stuff,\" he said.\"I think they were too constrained by their client\u0027 building methods.

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Pensioner pleads for help with poorly cat","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness pensioner is appealing for help with her cat\u0027 medical treatment after discovering that her monthly pet plan does not cover the cost of an X-ray.Marie MacIver\u0027 five-year-old cat Charlie has a painful leg and needs the scan to determine what treatment can be given.However, Mrs MacIver, who relies on disability benefit, is unable to afford the X-ray, which will cost about \u0026pound300.She has now contacted the\u0026nbspmedia in a plea for kind-hearted Invernessians to come forward.\"There is no way I can afford to pay for the X-ray,\" she said.\"Since it\u0027 very dficult for me to get out, I have already had to pay for the vet to come to the house and give Charlie a medical, as well as a bottle of anti-inflammatories which cost \u0026pound29 and did nothing.\"I already pay \u0026pound10 a month for a pet plan but it doesn\u0026rsquot seem to cover anything.\"I have tried everywhere to get help with the vet\u0027 bills \u0026ndash the PDSA, RSPCA and Cats Protection, but I haven\u0026rsquot been able to get help from anywhere.\"I hate to see him in pain and I think it\u0027 getting worse.\"It came out of the blue about a month ago, and now it is just not going away.\"Mrs MacIver lives alone with Charlie and says she has a special bond with her little cat.\"He\u0027 my companion and is often the only company I have,\" she said.\"He sleeps on my bed and follows me into the kitchen, and he seems to know not to stray too far from the house because I need him.\"He\u0027 really more like a dog than a cat.\"I try my best to take care of him but things like this are very dficult, and it is such a shame because he is a lovely little cat.\"I need to help Charlie get better.\"\u0026nbspCan you help Mrs MacIver with the cost of Charlie\u0027 X-ray?

disability service run by a health care partnership has been praised by a care watchdog.The Care Inspectorate has rated Learning Disability Integrated Care Services as “very good” for both its quality of care and support and its staffing following an unannounced inspection in July.The service, run by Aberdeen City Health and Social Care Partnership , provides housing support and care-at-home services for people with a learning disability who live in their own homes.Most of the support is given to people who stay in four custom-built housing complexes and the service also supports some who stay in inidual accommodation.ACHSCP chief officer Sandra Ross said: “The housing support and care-at-home teams epitomise our ethos of providing caring, person-centred and enabling care, which contributes so much to the wellbeing of our citizens with learning disabilities.“The Care Inspectorate has recognised the extremely high quality of the care we provide to some of the most vulnerable people in the city.“It is a credit to the teams involved, who are fully focused on providing the right care in the right place at the right time.”The inspection report said the service was “found to be of a very good standard”.It added: “We saw warm relationships between people, relaxed atmospheres and a helpful, team spirit.“We visited most of the accommodation complexes and spoke with people who use the service, staff, relatives and a visiting nurse.“Everyone was generally happy with the support, with comments such as ‘staff are very welcoming and competent, my daughter is treated as an inidual’ and ‘from the first visit, advice has been taken on board promptly, standards seem good’.“We saw staff who knew people well, had good working relationships, were relaxed and worked well as a cohesive team.”The Care Inspectorate placed no requirements on the service following their visit and made no recommendations for further action.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east school rated

constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a leline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight.

We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

The Shanghai visitors were enthralled by the salmon cutting, curing and smoking process, every step seemingly captured on film \u0026#8211 except, of course, the mixing of the company\u0026#8217s secret salmon curing recipe. \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s based on salt and sugar\u0026#8217 was as much as Richard would reveal.There was a little puzzlement at the oyster sheds when it was explained that the iety cultivated are from the Pacic, but the sheer scale and emphasis on quality impressed them hugely. And the method of knocking oyster shells together to check for freshness is one that is certain to be deployed in the Shanghai fish markets.Lestyle guru Ya Shu said: \u0026#8216The system here is incredible. I have never seen anything like it.\u0026#8217It was back across to the restaurant to sample a mouth-watering selection of seafood dishes prepared by a team led by Calum Hall, Loch Fyne Oysters\u0026#8217 head chef.Before any food could be sampled, it had to be photographed. And filmed by mobile phone. And photographed some more.Plate after plate of food was served \u0026#8211 from langoustines to chilli and cheddar oysters, and from scallops to whisky-infused smoked salmon.The visitors thoroughly enjoyed it. \u0026#8216The food is very dferent from what we are used to,\u0026#8217 said Qui Qui. \u0026#8216But it is very good.\u0026#8217Ya Shu went from oyster sceptic in Shanghai to Loch Fyne Oyster lover. \u0026#8216I had a plate full of oysters, which I never liked before coming here, he said.\u0026#8216I also liked very much the smoked salmon, langoustines and scallops.\u0026#8217Well fed and watered, the group left Cairndow bound for Edinburgh while as the next leg of their 10-day UK tour, six of which were spent in Scotland and the rest in London.Chinese followers of fashion clearly like what Qui Qui does.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

An early-morning police raid revealed Thomas Caldwell’s disgusting collection. The 35-year-old was caught with 18 Category A movies- showing the most vile type of child abuse. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that Caldwell, of Kyle StreetAyr, immediately admitted that he ‘downloaded some stuff’. And he blurted out to officers “I don’t get a lot of girls”. Caldwell admitted being in possession of the indecent material between March 15 and November 6. And he faced his sentencing last Thursday for his heinous behaviour. Defence solicitor Tony Currie told Sherf John Montgomery: “He did everything to be compliant with the police process. “He’s a man who’s used pornography in the past and he’s unfortunately allowed it to stray on these occasions. “He lost his employment as a direct consequence because of this matter and he’s actually sourced alternative employment.”  The Sherf queried reference made in the reports to one 27-minute long video. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin replied: “That’s the one they’ve chosen to describe in detail.” Steering clear of putting Caldwell behind bars, the Sherf said: “Quite clearly any offence of this gravity well merits a custodial sentence. “But my  is to consider  custody is the only option. “And in your case, involving mitigating and aggravating factors in respect of your offence -I’ve come to the conclusion that the mitigating outweighs the aggravating, and therefore conclude that you could be dealt with by way of a community payback order. “You will be supervised in the community for three years and it will be a requirement that you will be part of the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. “You do not approach or speak to a child under the age of 16 unless approved from your supporting officer.” Caldwell was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, and must not access the internet via computer or mobile phone. He has been placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register.

The boss saw his side blitz Falkirk with a second half super show on Saturday. And he insists inspiration was drawn not from his words – but the famous Somerset Road End. McCall admitted: “People are giving me credit for some kind of masterful team talk. “But the reality is our fans were dferent class and played a huge part in getting us back into that game. “At times it felt like the Somerset Road End was pulling the ball into the net. “That’s what makes this such a dficult place for opposition teams to come and we need to make the most of it. “I honestly don’t think our fans realise just how important they are to the team. “Saturday was proof of the key part they can play so let’s hope there’s a lot more to come.” United boast a 100 per cent record on home turf this season and McCall is determined that Somerset will become a fortress again. He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way. Jamie Adams will be rested from the articial surface while Daniel Harvie completes his two match suspension.

Last October, the Post reported how devastated cancer patients would have to travel up to 100 miles for le-saving chemotherapy as the axe falls on the treatment at Ayr Hospital. And it could take them three hours to travel from the Carrick area like the village of Ballantrae to Crosshouse in Kilmarnock as hospital chiefs push ahead with plans to centralise services. A campaigner attended a meeting of Cumnock Community Council to get their support for the campaign. He said: “I was asked to get involved in a steering group in January to fight this. “I don’t think we can’t facilitate the amount of patients in Kilmarnock “We want to keep two open. “It is consultation period just now but we think that they are going to shut the one in Ayr. “We will be looking to host roadshows to the public. “In this area, cancer had affected a lot of the population. “Very few people in this area know about the proposals. “They want to take everything down to Crosshouse.” Cumnock Community Council agreed to support the campaign. One community councillor said: “I think we need to fight this. “We also need to think of people who live in the likes of Damellington and Patna.” And the campaigner said: “We will fight to keep it open. We want the support of community councils, MSPs and councillors to keep the facility in Ayr open.” A community councillor said: “We should write to our MP andMSPs. They should listen to us and we should write to them and ask them to come here. “We should fight to keep two of them open. We should be ploughing money into the two of them. We should be fighting for two of them.” A NHS Ayrshire and Arran spokeswoman said the future arrangements for Chemotherapy Services in Ayrshire and Arran remain under review. She added: “An important aspect of reviewing the service is to ensure that we can continue to deliver increasingly complex chemotherapy treatments to the highest standards possible, taking account of all relevant clinical evidence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"new ayrshire nursery gets thumbs","story":"NewsNew Ayrshire nursery gets the thumbs upHuge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:00, 24 SEP 2018NewsHeads of Ayr farm park nursery design \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new nursery is to be built surrounded by farmyard animals and cute critters. Huge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park. And up to 20 jobs will be created. In a recent Ayrshire Post article celebrating 25 years of the farm park bosses Craig and Edna Rankin were excited about gaining approval for the nursery. They had suffered a blow as planning officials knocked it back in March on seven dferent policy points. But the couple’s architect Chris Stewart of Casa design in Ayr revealed: “Planning permission has now been granted for a new nursery school for up to 60 children. “It was approved on appeal on by the councillors on the Local Review Body.” Naturally the new nursery will have an outdoor theme. Edna said: “There is demand to get children back to nature and get outdoors. “There are so many new houses at Fisherton and Doonfoot and the area needs something. “Our own staff here cannot even find places to send their children.” Highly unusually, the plan had won universal support from the public with not one objection lodged with South Ayrshire Council. The application had been sent in earlier in 2017 but it was thrown out in December by council planners who were branded “very negative” by the architect. The site is currently a donkey pasture to the left of the farm steading and attractions and will include a new dedicated entrance from the A719 and car parking. The nursery will be built in the agricultural style with plenty of wooden cladding and some roof lights to mock a barn. The park attracts 180,000 people a year and has 90 staff. Director Greg Rankin said: “We were delighted to have planning for the Nursery granted by the Councils Local Review Board and I would like to thank them. “They were able to see the clear benefits that this project will bring to the area both for the local economy and local families . As well as all of the advantages to having a Nursery on site at Heads of Ayr Farm Park providing kids with the chance to learn and play in a safe outdoor environment. “Work on the Nursery starts shortly and we hope to have construction completed by Autumn next year. We are very excited to get started on its development and have been encouraged by lots of support from Locals and regular visitors of the Farm Park.” Casa Design architect Chris added: “It has taken two years to get to this stage, with ious consultations with the Planning Department and the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. The owners of the Farm Park have extensively researched this type of rural nursery, tied in with farm parks elsewhere in the UK and are very excited about the project. “It was very disappointing that the Planning Department decided to refuse the application in March this year on seven points which they construed as being contrary to the South Ayrshire Local Development Plan and Scottish Planning Policy. “We have found the Planning Department to be very negative with this application from the start. However, we are delighted that after an appeal, the councillors at the Local Review Body hearing this week saw the bigger picture and overturned their planners decision to refuse the application.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"pro wrestling elite stage stacked","story":"NewsPro Wrestling Elite to stage stacked card in Ayr as Kenny Williams defends Heavyweight TitleThe thrills and spills of PWE are ing to Ayr Town Hall tomorrow night with a packed card.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet15:16, 21 SEP 2018NewsPro Wrestling Elite champion Kenny Williams\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat tomorrow as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership. If they can hold their nerve and service the 15-goal striker, they may just cause a shock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterRangers NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Rangers newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotland U21s football teamAyr United FCAlloa Athletic FCRangers FC"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon pensioners 900 mile solo","story":"NewsTroon pensioner\u0027s 900-mile solo effort for charityGeorge Dunlop, from Troon, peddled across the country to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer Support, who offered him care and help 28 years ago when he had cancer.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie12:46, 25 SEP 2018Updated12:47, 25 SEP 2018NewsGeorge reaches Land’s End as he crosses the finish line \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner with an articial knee has cycled almost 900 miles in the name of charity.

The 68-year-old cycled from John O’Groats to Land’s End and despite having an articial knee and suffering a puncture at Birmingham, George completed the cycle in 19 days. Cancer survivor George said: “I had never forgotten the help Ayrshire Cancer Support gave me getting to hospital, and I wanted to  the favour. “The cycle was hard going but I had something in my system that refused to give in. “I did it all on my own, without back-up, and it was a tremendous. “I cycled on canals and old railway lines and, to make up time, sometimes on busy roads.” George lived in Fenwick until 2015 and, following the passing of his we, moved to Troon.  Having been diagnosed with cancer in 1990 and survived the illness, he was motivated to complete the series of climbing all of Scotland’s 282 Munros. When given the all-clear, he had taken up cycling to regain full fitness and continues to cover many miles on two wheels each week. Laura Brown, income and marketing manager for Ayrshire Cancer Support, said: “Despite not liking to ask anyone for money, George collected \u0026pound300, including \u0026pound130 on the road during his arduous cycle the  of the UK. “I’m sure when people know that he has undertaken this huge cycle in aid of Ayrshire Cancer Support, they will be only too delighted to dig deep and show their support. “We are grateful for the support of all fundraisers, whose generosity is crucial to the services we provide for those affected by cancer. “George pulled out all the stops to benefit Ayrshire Cancer Support and it is thanks to him that we can continue supporting families all across Ayrshire affected by cancer.” People can donate to George’s appeal by sending cheques or donating directly to Ayrshire Cancer Support at 22 Wellington Square, Ayr.

submarine hunter has landed in Kintyre.The \u0026#8216Air Ace of Argyll \u0026#8211 Airships in the Great War and the Story of Major J G Struthers\u0026#8217 exhibition in Campbeltown Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on to Helensburgh and Dunoon.Councillor John Armour,

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

Dr Gordon Rintoul, director of National Museums Scotland, invited members of the public to attend either of the two public consultation events.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.  The plans will be revealed for the first time on Tuesday at Haddington\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre.  The drop-in session, which runs from 3pm to 7pm, will allow members of the public to see the initial designs and also speak to members of the team behind the proposals. A second event takes place 6-8pm at East Linton Primary School on October 24.  Mr Rintoul added: \u0026ldquoThe National Museum of Flight is already a signicant component of East Lothian\u0026rsquos visitor economy and this investment will drive additional employment opportunities and help further stimulate the development of the area\u0026rsquos tourism sector.  \u0026ldquoThis is the next step in the development of the museum, which started with the arrival of Concorde in 2004 and has seen extensive investment in the site in recent years, including the creation of new exhibitions in 2009 and the restoration and re-display of two original Second World War hangars in 2016.  \u0026ldquoWe hope that residents will take the opportunity to come along to one of our two planned consultation events, view the design and discuss it with our team. We\u0026rsquore keen to hear what people think of our proposals.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip.

The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.

Her six grandchildren are Andrew, 17, Colin, 12, twins Liam and Connor, eight, Luka, seven, and Isla, four.  When she was first diagnosed with the illness, Olive said she felt her le had suddenly stopped.  She said: \"When I first found out I was fed up and depressed, I didn\u0027t want to talk about it with anyone.  \"I eventually sucked it all up and I thought  I decide to give up then I would have already been defeated.  \"You just never know which part of your brain will go first but I will enjoy today and worry about tomorrow later.\"  When Olive realised she was no longer good at mental arithmetic and struggled to remember words, she took it upon herself to find out  she had dementia - as there is a family history of the condition on the female side.  That was in 2012 when she was 61 and had ed to Scotland to retire after 40 years in Canada.  The gran-of-six was referred for tests and, aged 63, was told she had a 10 per cent memory loss at that stage.  In 2015, following further tests, she was officially diagnosed with vascular dementia.  Recently, Olive, who previously managed a care home, completed a mammoth trek to raise money for pioneering research.  On May 1 Olive started walking the famous Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route through France and northern Spain with her husband, Ronnie, for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK.  Walking a minimum of 10km each day, the couple took two months to complete the 780km route \u0026ndash a month quicker than planned.  She said: \"I was looking for ideas for something we could do to raise money.  \"There are some things I can\u0026rsquot do, but I watched the film The Way, starring Martin Sheen, where they trek the Comino de Santiago route, and I thought \u0026lsquoI can walk, let\u0026rsquos go for that\u0026rsquo.  \"The trek was very tough, but we got stronger and stronger each day.  \"The hardest point was early on when we both got sick.  \"Because we were focused on walking, we didn\u0026rsquot realise how ill we were. We had to stop and rest for three days.\"  Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia and occurs when blood flow to the brain becomes reduced.  It\u0026rsquos estimated to affect about 150,000 people in the UK and is rare in people under 65.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"new-plans-for-the-future-of-scotlands-ferry-fleet-would-see-more-smaller-vessels","story":"  Crew members lined up at either end of the vessel as it docks in port, before throwing ropes over the side for colleagues ashore to tie up the vessel and allow passengers on and off.  But this could be consigned to history under radical plans to transform Scotland\u0026rsquos ferry network which are detailed in a blueprint which will go before MSP\u0026rsquos this week.  Under the proposals, the current model of serving island communities will be ripped up and instead will be based on the Norwegian system of smaller ferries covering shorter routes.  The move aims to increase capacity with more ferries and in some cases journeys being broken up using islands as \"land bridges\" to reduce journey times.  It would see islanders in the Outer Hebrides able to do business on the mainland in a day and  home without an overnight stay.  According to the expert behind it, it would also help repopulate islands as crew would live on the islands they serve rather than on board and staffing costs would be reduced.  Perhaps crucially, it would also dramatically reduce the annual subsidy paid to ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne to run the service.  The blueprint for the future of the network will go before Holyrood this week and comes as CalMac has been heavily criticised after a summer of disruption across the network due to breakdowns of the ageing fleet.  Transport expert Roy Pedersen, who spent 30 years in Highlands and Islands development, has submitted evidence which he says would radically reform the network and save the taxpayer millions of pounds in subsidies paid to CalMac.  According to the proposal, the current level of investment is well in excess of other countries but productivity is \u0026ldquoextremely poor and deteriorating.  Under his plan, a new fleet of around 10 smaller, more efficient ferries would be built with the total bill of around \u0026pound280 million. Upgrades to the ports they would serve will cost another \u0026pound20m.  Pedersen points out that Andrew Banks, owner of Pentland Ferries, is awaiting delivery of a new 100-car capacity ferry at a cost of \u0026pound14m, compared with \u0026pound50m-plus for the new hybrid green ferry MV Glen Sannox currently being built at Ferguson\u0027s.  One of the main points in the paper is reducing the number of staff required for each journey and ending the practice of ferry staff staying on board which adds to the operating costs.  Ferries would be crewed by a staff of around 12 to 14 as opposed to the 30-plus currently used.  This would allow staff to work shts similar to other operators and in Norway, and enable more ferries to run during the day and extend the timetable with services starting earlier and finishing later.  Staff would also live in the communities they serve which, it is argued, would help boost the populations of remote island communities as the smaller ferries would be based in the island ports and not on the mainland.  Pedersen said: \u0026ldquoThe alternative of crew living ashore on island communities served would contribute to the government\u0026rsquos objective of boosting island economies and reduce ship capital and operating costs.  \u0026ldquoFor the larger CalMac vessels it takes nine personnel to berth and cast-off a ship, this is done in Norway with just one hand due to efficient \u0026ldquolock-on linkspan design.  \u0026ldquoThus,  more cost-effective policies and practices along Scandinavian lines were adopted, much improved and higher capacity services could be provided for less public money.  Lock-on linkspans are already used in Scotland at the ports served by Western Ferries at Hunter\u0026rsquos Quay, near Gourock and on Shetland\u0026rsquos inter-island ferries.  Western Ferries carry more passengers and vehicles than the CalMac competition on the routes but receives no public subsidy. Each lock-on linkspan would cost around \u0026pound1.5m to install at each of the 10 large ports that CalMac would serve with the new ferries.  But while the installation costs of around \u0026pound15m seems expensive, the cost of the vessels themselves add another \u0026pound280m.  However, two new hybrid ferries being built to ease pressure on the network, the MV Glen Sannox and its sister ship, cost nearly \u0026pound100m. But the bill is set to be much higher as both are currently delayed until next summer at the earliest after hitting design problems at the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow which has heaped more pressure on the ageing fleet.  The delays come amid concerns that a recent signicant increase in traffic is causing severe problems for island communities. Tourism bosses on the Outer Hebrides have already warned the disruption has cost them millions of pounds this year.  Now CalMac\u0026rsquos own community board has condemned delays in new ferries and is demanding action. It was formed as part of CalMac\u0026rsquos successful franchise bid for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service in 2016.  At a recent meeting of the board in Mallaig, \u0026ldquodisappointment and frustration was reported from all parts of the network at the continuing delays in the delivery of the overdue vessels under construction, said chairman Angus Campbell.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt a meeting, also attended by CMAL and Transport Scotland, strong reservations were expressed at the apparent lack of a coherent long-term vessel replacement plan and the funding commitments necessary to provide both an improved fleet and the port improvements needed.  \u0026ldquoThe board feel they can work alongside the operator to help improve information quality and timing including maximising local knowledge.  \u0026ldquoThe communities board are keen to work positively with all parties to produce a more resilient and ambitious future for our ferry services resulting in better economic benefits for all that they serve but feel there is a real need for action now.  Critics say the current problems has been a generation in the making. Scotland\u0026rsquos islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old and are struggling to cope.  The average age of a ship is 22 and in the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building with 7,000 tonnes worth in 1994 alone, the average age was just 12.  Between January and the end of July this year, 2,326 out of 79,203 CalMac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these, 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because CalMac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  But when a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. CalMac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled ready to move in and act as relief.  Even  it did have a spare, CalMac could far from guarantee it could use it because every port is dferent, whether it be an ageing linkspan or unusual tide, making it dficult for ferries just to slot in.  However,  every port was fitted with the same locked-in linkspan and ferries were smaller and more versatile then they could be moved around the network more easily to cover any breakdowns, according to the blueprint.  The blueprint also outlines how routes could be shortened and slash journey times.  In Norway, ferries tend to travel between the shortest points across the water, with islands themselves being part of the journey.  Rather than go round the islands, ferries will dock at the nearest point, passengers will travel across the island by road, before picking up a ferry at the other side to continue the journey by sea.  Under the new proposal, Mull and Jura could play vital roles acting as these \u0026ldquoland bridges, slash journey times and increase service frequency to Islay and the Outer Hebrides.  Ferries would dock at Craignure on Mull as normal, but Barra passengers would travel on to Tobermory where they would pick up another ferry to continue the journey.  New terminals would also be built at Glendale on Skye to shorten the crossing to Lochmaddy on North Uist and another at Kilmoluaig to Tarbert on Harris.  Likewise, Islay passengers would get a ferry from Keills on the mainland and travel to Lagg on Jura, before crossing to Islay. One other advantage is that carbon emissions would be greatly reduced without the need for hybrid fuel ferries.  Pedersen added: \u0026ldquoBoth are much shorter than the current Kennacraig to Port Askaig/Port Ellen service on Islay and would allow up to ten daily crossings and the option of direct bus services between the islands and Glasgow.  Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: \u0026ldquoWe are continuing to invest in new vessels and ferry infrastructure to renew the fleet in accordance with the published Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan. Over \u0026pound1 billion has been invested in ferry services across the Clyde and Hebrides routes, since 2007.  \u0026ldquoWork is also already under way to appraise, and subsequently to deliver on, further improvements to the ferry services to the Western Isles.  The majority of all visitors to the Outer Hebrides travel through Stornoway harbour, emphasising the importance of the CalMac ferry service to both the town and the wider islands.  The M.V Loch Seaforth, the biggest vessel in the CalMac fleet, sails between Ullapool and Stornoway three times a day, bringing with it up to 700 passengers, 143 cars or 20 commercial vehicles each time it arrives in Lewis.  Some 280,000 ferry passengers, 95,000 cars and 13,000 commercial vehicles a year come to Stornoway via the ferry.  Weekend crossings operate at full capacity and strong growth in tourism means that there are severe capacity constraints during the summer months.  Stornoway Port Authority, which has ambitious plans to develop the harbour as part of a 20-year Master Plan, is developing proposals to ensure the Port is able to accommodate the freight ferry which will likely be deployed to the route over the next few years.  Alex Macleod, the authority\u0026rsquos chief executive, said: \u0026ldquoThe existing ferry provides a good service which is an absolute leline for the community. But the risks in being dependent on a single vessel underline the need for additional capacity to cope with existing requirements and future needs.  \u0026ldquoThe projects we are developing in the Master Plan will help stimulate further economic growth but capacity limitations on ferries could have an impact on that potential growth.  \u0026ldquoThere will always be dficulties with ferry traffic in such a weather-affected part of the world, and as we have done for over 140 years, we will continue to work very closely with Calmac ferries to assist with the delivery of a robust and flexible service. Liaising closely with Calmac Ferries we will work together to find solutions for the good of the islands and everyone who uses these essential ferry services.  HebCelt relies heavily on CalMac ferry services to bring thousands of music fans to Lewis each summer.  The event is a huge economic driver for the islands, generating more than \u0026pound2 million a year and filling hotels, guest houses and campsites. Half the festival audience comes from outside the islands and the ferry route from Ullapool to Stornoway is the main gateway to the Outer Hebrides for these visitors.  HebCelt is also a catalyst for many island-hopping holidays with festival-goers using it as the start of a tour of Lewis, Harris, the Uists and Barra which also depend on CalMac services.  Such is the demand during HebCelt that ferry services have been extended in recent years around festival time to ensure fans are able to get to and from the islands.  Festival director Caroline Maclennan said: \u0026ldquoWe have a really close relationship with CalMac and appreciate many of the dficulties and challenges it faces.  \u0026ldquoCalMac is doing its best with an ageing fleet. The real conversation taking place just now is the frustration over the lack of investment in our leline services by successive governments.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to criticise the service when things go wrong, but there are many sides to it.  \u0026ldquoWe have a very constructive dialogue with the company which helps us effectively address issues, not just those directly affecting ferry services, but also travel to ports and connecting services which can affect both regular travellers and visitors."},{"url":null,"title":"st-marys-music-school-ready-to-transform-old-royal-high-school-in-new-home-for-music","story":"  The future of the Old Royal High School is currently in the balance: currently two Scottish Government reporters are hearing evidence in an appeal from co-developers Duddingston House Properties and Urbanist Hotels.  They are appealing against the City of Edinburgh Council\u0027s decision to refuse planning permission for a luxury hotel on the site in August last year.  If the reporters reject the appeal, and Scottish Government ministers follow their advice, then St Mary\u0027s Music School says it is ready to take over the site.  : Paper sculpture aids music school campaign  The school, which has both planning permission and financial backing for their plan to turn the building into its new headquarters, said it would take around two years to transform the site.  Last week it launched a new campaign to get around 40,000 people to send a \"polite note\" to the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, a note which supports the music school plan.  Dr Kenneth Taylor, the headteacher of St Mary\u0026rsquos Music School, said: \"It\u0027s designed to let people know what although the inquiry is ongoing, there is actually a very exciting alternative.  \"And furthermore we have planning permission for these plans, the funding for these plans are in place - which in terms of a philanthropic gt to Scotland [from the Dunard Fund] is unparalleled in recent times.  \"It\u0027s an investment of \u0026pound35m, which is incredibly exciting - and we are ready to go.  \"We are just being held up by the appeal process - the Note campaign is designed to remind our supporters, remind the people of Edinburgh and to remind the politicians that we are here, and ready to go, and there is an alternative.\"  : New St Mary\u0027s Music School Campaign  The appeal process, currently taking place in Heart of Midlothian\u0027s Tynecastle Park stadium, is expected to last six weeks.  The reporters are expected to make their recommendations at the end of this year, or the beginning of 2019, and then Ministers decided whether they will uphold or reject the reporters\u0027 decision.  St Mary\u0027s Music School currently does not have the right to take over the building - it is understood the hotel developers have a deal with the council to develop the site, which expires in 2022.  Dr Taylor added: \"We could start tomorrow,  we were given the go-ahead, and we have been working closely with the architect - we have a great consensus around these plans from so many angles.\"  He said that the school\u0027s plans would open up their work to the community more, with concerts and an expanded education plan.  The Old Royal High School would also be used as a Edinburgh Festival venue.  It would have a public concert hall and garden, as well as new additions to the Thomas Hamilton-designed building.  : Music school seeks support for Old Royal High plan  The school said the new 280-seat concert hall could stage more than 100 public performances a year, attracting audiences of over 20,000 annually.  Dr Taylor added: \"We have been greatly heartened by the size and strength of the wonderful support we have already received from so many people in Edinburgh, as well as prominent figures in the arts and music community \u0026ndash Nicola Benedetti, Sir James MacMillan, Alexander Armstrong and Steven Osborne, to name just a few.  \"Moving to the Old Royal High School would give the school increased capacity, allowing us to offer a specialist music education to more young people of outstanding music ability.  \"Furthermore, we could open our doors to Edinburgh, Scotland and internationally with a whole range of new music activities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-and-senior-colleagues-resist-party-pressure-for-backing-peoples-vote","story":"  Party sources suggested the likely outcome of deliberations on having a vote at the end of a debate on Brexit tomorrow would be a \u0026ldquofudge, which would stress the party\u0026rsquos clear preference for another general election, should Theresa May\u0026rsquos final plan on Britain\u0026rsquos EU withdrawal fail to get the support of MPs later this year.  Any move by the Labour leadership to directly back the so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash the supporters of which say it should include the option of staying in the EU - would be a reversal of policy, which is simply to keep it on the table.  It would also be a landmark decision in the Brexit process as it would align Labour not only with the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign itself but also the Liberal Democrats.  Mr Corbyn said he was \u0026ldquobound by the democracy of our party but also noted: \u0026ldquoLet\u0027s see what comes out of conference.  His deputy Tom Watson also made clear  party members voted to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote, he would support the move.  \"Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour Party back to its members. So,  the people\u0027s party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it,\" he said.  Last night, around 100 Labour delegates were engaged in intense discussions behind closed doors deciding on the key issue of the wording of the Brexit motion to be debated and voted upon.  Earlier, the Labour leader, while he made clear he would support the will of the party  its members decided to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote, stressed he personally believed a general election would be a better way to resolve the political crisis over the nature of the UK\u0027s departure from the EU.  And Len McCluskey, the Unite leader, warned that any second vote on Brexit should not be asking  the public wanted to stay in the EU as proposed by those supporting a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  \"We have already had a People\u0027s Vote they voted to come out of the EU,\" declared Mr McCluskey.  At a fringe event last night, he warned: \"We have to be careful about how we play with our democracy.\"  Highlighting the tensions at the top of the party, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, admitted to having \"reservations\" about backing another vote because, she argued, the Conservative Government \"might be able to skew it in particular directions to secure the result they wanted\".  The Labour leadership, which has always said it respected the 2016 referendum result, is fearful that any open support for a second EU vote, which included the option of reversing that decision, would alienate a swathe of Labour voters, who backed Brexit.  The position of the leadership has been made dficult after a poll found 86 per cent of Labour members thought voters should have the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations and 90 per cent said they would now vote to remain in the EU.  Yesterday in Liverpool, thousands of people, including MPs, MEPs, trade union leaders and activists marched through the city and attended a rally, calling for a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  As he addressed the gathering Labour MP David Lammy said: \"Are you listening Jeremy Corbyn?\"  Highlighting how people from across the UK were present, the Tottenham MP said: \"They are saying squarely to the leadership of the Labour Party: \u0027Listen to us, hear us, give us a People\u0027s Vote.\u0027  \"When we have that People\u0027s Vote let us ensure that the option to remain in the EU is on the ballot paper,\" he declared.  A crowd waving EU and other flags chanted \"b*****ks to Brexit\" and \"it\u0027s not a done deal\" as they walked from St George\u0027s Hall in the city centre to the rally at Pier Head, close to where the conference is taking place.  Manuel Cortes, the General Secretary of the TSSA transport union, also backed calls for Labour to support a second referendum on Brexit.  \"The terms of Brexit should be put to the British people,\" he declared, adding: \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union but that doesn\u0027t mean buying a pig in the poke or giving the Prime Minister a blank cheque. Whatever she negotiates she needs to bring back to the British people.\"  Last night at a rally at the World Transformed Festival, running alongside the conference, Mr Corbyn said the rich were on \"borrowed time\" as he took aim at their tax breaks and offshore havens.  After receiving a rapturous reception, he told the audience the \"poorest and most vulnerable\" had been forced to pay the price for the 2008 financial crash.  The Labour leader said that winning an election was \"not going to be easy\" but hailed the power of \"popular movements coming together\".  Stressing how challenging neoliberal economics was \u0026ldquofundamental to what we believe in,\" Mr Corbyn added: \"Austerity has been meted out on the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society.  \"They are the ones who paid the price of the banking crisis of 2008, all the time the very richest in our society have had tax breaks, giveaways and tax havens.  \"I tell you what: they are on borrowed time because a Labour government is coming.\""},{"url":null,"title":"marianne-taylor-jeremy-corbyn-has-one-last-chance-to-do-the-right-thing-over-brexit","story":"  At the other end of the political spectrum Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have descended upon Liverpool for surely the most important Labour conference in a generation. Despite spending a long, hot summer fiddling while Rome burned, becoming ever more deeply embroiled in an antisemitism row rather than putting forward a coherent position on Brexit, the party still has a chance to help lead the country away from the Brexit clf edge.  After all, backing a second referendum on Brexit is the party\u0026rsquos last chance to make a meaningful, potentially game-changing contribution at this moment of crisis. If it fails to do so future generations will never forgive Mr Corbyn for blowing the chance to either stop or soften Brexit.  What is the point of Labour  it is not to protect the folk from the worst excesses of the Tories? And make no mistake, it\u0026rsquoll be the already brutalised millions in the middle and at the bottom who will suffer most from the no-deal Brexit we are careering towards.  Yet the mood music coming from party leadership remains as off-tune as ever. Yesterday, Mr Corbyn grudgingly conceded he would back the so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote  his membership absolutely insists upon it, arguing that a general election is the answer to the country\u0026rsquos currently problems.  Meanwhile, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said over the weekend that Labour would push ahead with Brexit  it won a snap election, insisting his party would somehow miraculously get a much better deal from the EU than the Tories, despite also having ruled out staying in the single market. Does he honestly believe Brussels will look more favourably on Labour rejecting fundamental EU principles such as free movement than the Tories? Didn\u0026rsquot he see President Macron\u0026rsquos two-fingered reaction to Mrs May\u0026rsquos rhetoric last week?  It is simply not credible for Labour to fight a general election on a manesto that favours ploughing ahead with a similarly destructive Brexit when a poll would only be necessary because the Conservatives had failed to agree a plan.  Mr McDonnell also claimed during an interview that pulling back from Brexit could result in xenophobia. What planet is he living on? Can\u0026rsquot he see that leaving the EU hands victory on a plate to the xenophobes?  A recent tweet by his shadow cabinet colleague Barry Gardiner revealed just how twisted the logic of the party leadership has become. When asked by a despairing Labour activist why the current Brexit chaos elicited only silence from Labour, Mr Gardiner replied: \u0026ldquoNever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.  The idea that keeping your mouth shout and failing to make a credible alternative case, either for a soft Brexit or no Brexit at all, makes you a suitable and trustworthy opposition when the country is heading for utter disaster is either naive, arrogant or stupid - most likely all three.  Despite continual obfuscation, it\u0026rsquos crystal clear that Mr Corbyn and his deputy are as Eurosceptic as many of the Tories they have spent their lives opposing. In light of this, perhaps Mr Gardiner\u0026rsquos tweet should more accurately have stated: \u0026ldquoNever interrupt your enemy when he is saying something you agree with, but don\u0026rsquot have the guts to admit to.  I\u0026rsquom not suggesting Mr Corbyn should not be allowed to oppose Britain\u0026rsquos EU membership. What I\u0026rsquom saying is that he should have been honest about it from the start. As a potential prime minister, however, he must also be able to let go of personal principles, no matter how deeply and honestly held, when the good of the country is at stake. As we have seen regularly since his election, however - most recently during the antisemitism debacle - compromise is not something that comes easy to this dogmatic old Leftie.  We must hope, therefore, that the party membership, many of whom are young people who oppose Brexit, can force common sense upon the leadership. There is overwhelming support there for a second referendum, with one recent poll suggesting 85 per cent want a say on the outcome of negotiations, with an even higher proportion in favour staying in the EU.  There would potentially be a signicant electoral boost in adopting the People\u0026rsquos Vote, at last giving Labour a strong, distinctive and viable policy that people from across the UK - including Scotland - could get behind. And an electoral lt is exactly what the party needs despite taking the country to the edge of the abyss, the Tories remain ahead in the polls.  Mr Corbyn now has one final opportunity to redeem himself and put country before conviction. We must hope he has the sense and humility to take it."},{"url":null,"title":"non-religious-pupils-could-be-excluded-from-nativity-plays","story":"  The attack comes after the Church said such pupils would face wider exclusion from \"charitable fundraising, Nativity plays and feast day celebrations\".  Officials from the Humanist Society Scotland and Secular Scotland said denominational schools could even face legal action  they followed the advice.  Earlier this month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government intended to incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into Scots Law.  The a move is signicant because the UN\u0027s Children\u0027s Rights Committee recommended the current right of parents in Scotland to opt out of religious observance should be extended to pupils.  Responding to the suggestion a spokesman for the Catholic Church said: \"Current guidance, allowing pupils to express their views on religious observance, allows them to be given an explanation of the advantages of religious education and religious observance, following which many pupils continue to attend.\"  The spokesman said schools would organise \"purposeful work\" for those pupils who still wanted to opt out.  But he added: \"Parents and pupils who wish to opt out on grounds of conscience are advised that, in order not to contradict their wishes, schools will ensure they are not part of any other religious education and religious observance activities such as religiously-motivated charitable fundraising, Nativity play or feast day celebrations. Very few wish to be excluded in this way from the le of the school.\"  The statement provoked an angry backlash from Gordon MacRae, chief executive of the Scottish Humanist Society, who described it as \u0026ldquodisturbing.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis suggests denominational schools coerce or threaten to isolate children and young people from the school community because of their faith or belief.  \"Following such a course of action would put denominational school headteachers in potentially actionable situations and completely distract them from the professional work they do educating pupils and running inclusive school environments.  \"All schools in Scotland, including denominational ones, have a responsibility under law to respect and uphold the independent human right to freedom of religion and belief.\"  Robert Canning, chair of Secular Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe would not agree that children opted out of religious observance, by themselves or their parents, should automatically be excluded from all activities connected with religion, since not all such activities involve worship or prayer.  \"Children acting in Nativity plays are obviously expressing the outlook of the characters and not their own beliefs, and a child might want to be part of a fundraising effort without having the religious motivation that other participants might claim.\"  Professor Paul Braterman, from the Scottish Secular Society, said: \"Parents and pupils should be allowed to decide for themselves regarding matters such as Nativity plays and Feast Day celebrations, on a case-by-case basis.  Meanwhile, teaching unions welcomed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos intention to incorporate the UN\u0027s convention on children\u0027s rights into Scots Law.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland said the union would support the right of children, at a suitable point in their development, to be able to withdraw from religious assemblies  they wished.  He added: \"We would support children at a suitable point in their development having the right to withdraw  they wish and note that Scottish Government guidance makes it clear that in no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.  \"Under the terms of the Equality Act, schools have a legal duty to prevent discrimination against those who hold particular religious or philosophical beliefs and to actively ensure that they have equal opportunity to participate in the le of the school.  \"To actively exclude children from activities which may be religion-related, but which would not be classied as religious observance, is likely to invite strong legal challenge.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"The existing statutory guidance recognises that when a parent chooses a denominational school ... there is an expectation that they have opted into the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice including activities relating to religious faith and observance.  \"Our guidance also states no pupil should be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawal from religious observance.\"  In Scotland, all young people require parental permission to pull out of religious observance, unlike England and Wales where sixth form pupils \u0026ndash typically aged between 16 and 18 \u0026ndash have the right to opt out.  The law which governs religious observance, originally dating from 1872, has not been updated since 1980 and the latest guidance from the Scottish Government was issued in 2011.  The guidance states: \"Where a parent chooses a denominational school for their child\u0026rsquos education, they choose to opt in to the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice which is imbued with religious faith and religious observance.  \"In denominational schools, it is therefore more dficult to extricate a pupil from all experiences which are influenced by the school\u0026rsquos faith character.  \"Where a pupil is withdrawn from religious observance schools should make suitable arrangements for the pupil to participate in a worthwhile alternative activity. In no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-says-any-peoples-vote-should-not-include-option-of-britain-staying-in-eu","story":"  Pro-EU activists\u0027 hopes of the party fully throwing its weight behind a People\u0026rsquos Vote suffered a major setback at Labour\u0027s conference in Liverpool.  More than 100 constituency parties submitted motions demanding a second referendum and thousands of people joined a march calling for a so-called People\u0027s Vote in order to put pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to change course.  But, as expected, after a marathon \u0026ldquocompositing session on Sunday night, the exact wording of the motion to be put to a vote at the party\u0027s conference tomorrow states only that \" we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".  This is effectively a restatement of the leadership\u0026rsquos position.  However, John McDonnell, a key ally of the party leader, went further this morning by making clear that  there were any second referendum, it should be on whether or not to accept a Brexit deal or conduct fresh negotiations with Brussels rather than seek to reverse the 2016 decision to leave the EU.  The Shadow Chancellor explained: \"We argued for Remain in the past but we lost that vote so we have to respect that. All the polling that we have seen is that the country is still pretty split down the middle.  \u0026ldquoMy big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  it\u0027s slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.\"  He noted how the 2016 poll \"opened up all sorts of xenophobic feelings and a rise of the Right\" and stressed: \"I don\u0027t want to revive Ukip in any way or even the far Right\".  The precise wording of the referendum question would be a matter for Parliament, Mr McDonnell pointed out, telling BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"If we are going to respect the referendum, it[a People\u0027s Vote] will be about the deal.\"  On Good Morning Britain he suggested that a general election would be \"the real People\u0027s Vote\" because it would give the public the chance to change the team carrying out the negotiations, replacing Theresa May with a Labour government.  But he acknowledged the debate at the conference \"may be rumbustious\".  Labour MP David Lammy, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, was not best pleased, saying it would be \"farcical\" to have a vote without the option of remaining in the EU.  \"A People\u0027s Vote is the only realistic option to save this country from the car crash of Brexit, declared the London MP.  \"No Tory or DUP MP is likely to vote for a general election. Turkeys do not tend to vote for Christmas.\"  He added: \"We\u0027ve now got to turn up the noise until we secure a public vote which gives us the option to remain in the UK.\"  Mr Lammy received support from his Labour colleague and fellow Remainer Chuka Umunna, who called for an \"unequivocal\" commitment to a second referendum with remaining in the EU as an option.  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats said, by ruling out the option of Britain staying in the EU in a second referendum, the Labour leadership was aiding and abetting Theresa May on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove spent two years backing the Tories\u0026rsquo catastrophic Brexit and are even now trying to ignore their own members who want a People\u0026rsquos Vote with the option to remain in the EU.  \u0026ldquoIt beggars belief that McDonnell and Co are spending so much time trying to trick and stitch up their own conference rather than campaigning for an exit from Brexit to protect jobs and services in the UK.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe only choice a \u0026lsquodeal or no deal\u0026rsquo vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at. Liberal Democrats demand better than Brexit and want to give the people the final say on any deal through a People\u0027s Vote where they will have the option to remain in the EU.  Eloise Todd of pro-EU Best for Britain said it would be \"unthinkable\" for a second vote not to include the option of Britain staying in the EU and was \"not what the 90 per cent of Labour members who back a public vote would expect\".  She added: \"Labour must listen to its members on this and the vast majority of its voters. It\u0026rsquos time for a final say with the option to stay.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-denies-workers-shareholding-plan-would-lead-to-less-investment","story":"  The Shadow Chancellor took to the airwaves to promote Labour\u0026rsquos new plan, saying: \"If you look at other economies, like Germany, where there\u0027s been much more worker involvement, it\u0027s been the reverse.  \"You get more investment, you get longer-term decision-making and you have a growing economy. This is nothing unusual. It happens in other countries and it has proved to be successful.\"  But Carolyn Fairburn, the CBI Director-General, said Labour\u0027s plans would hit share prices and cause investment to \"flee\" the country.  She told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"Take steps like this and we will set the clock back, investment will flee our country and, whatever Labour say about this, the outcome will be one that reduces pay in people\u0027s pockets.\"  Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell said Jeremy Corbyn should be succeeded by a woman. Conference is expected to back a rule change to create having a female deputy leader to work alongside the current deputy Tom Watson, leading to speculation that when Mr Corbyn stands down, he will be succeeded by a woman.  The Shadow Chancellor told Today: \"The next leader of the Labour party has to be a woman.\"  Changes to rules governing leadership elections and selection of MP candidates have been approved at conference.  Members and unions voted 63.94 per cent for and 36.06 per cent against the changes to the leadership rules and 65.32 per cent for and 34.68 per cent against the changes to selection of MP candidates.  Under the reselection rule change, the threshold to force sitting MPs to fight open selection battles will be cut from 50 to 33 per cent of local branches or affiliated unions.  Labour MPs currently face a so-called \"trigger ballot\" before each general election but must fight against other contenders for the candidacy only  a majority of local branches and affiliated unions back an open selection contest.  The new change will require an open contest  either 33 per cent of local party branches or 33 per cent of affiliated trade union branches demand one.  The rule change for future leadership contests does not alter the 10 per cent threshold for the number of MPs\u0027 nominations which a candidate must gather to get on to the ballot paper but also requires would-be leaders to secure nominations from fiver per cent of constituency parties or five per cent of members of trade unions or affiliated organisations."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-bring-it-on-red-john-pushes-all-the-socialist-buttons","story":"  As John McDonnell went through his conference ritual of pressing every Socialist button he could find, my neighbour, miraculously, received an electric shock each time and jumped up enthusiastically.

Remember this was the one which Tony B changed to entrench New Labour\u0026rsquos commitment to economic dynamism.  \u0026ldquoI say the Clause 4 principles are as relevant today as they were back then, declared Red John. Comrade X shouted: \u0026ldquoYes, yes, yes, and clapped loudly.  The Shadow Chancellor praised the Archbishop of Canterbury - not an everyday occurrence - who got into a spot of bother after calling zero hours contracts \u0026ldquoevil it emerged some Anglican churches were advertising the very same.  Justin Welby got it in the neck from the right-wing press but Red John had some soothing words for the archbish: \u0026ldquoWhen they get round to calling you a Marxist, I\u0026rsquoll give you some tips on how to handle it.  Next up was giving workers a shareholding in their companies and the creation of a social idend to help fund public services. Comrade X hollered his support.  Then came the N-word the nationalisation of water, energy, the Royal Mail and the railways. My neighbour was by now jumping up and down with delight.  After hitting out at the banking fat cats, it was onto Brexit and the chance for Red John to send an electric shock throughout the entire conference hall.  Noting how he was not going to lower expectations, the wannabe Chancellor declared to a wave of applause: \u0026ldquoThe greater the mess we inherit, the more radical we have to be. By now Comrade X needed a glass of water.  But the peak of my neighbour\u0026rsquos enthusiasm was about to be hit when the Labour chief mentioned how the Tories were supposedly drawing up secret plans for a quick general election. \u0026ldquoSo, the message from this conference is, declared Red John: \u0026ldquobring it on!  The electric current shot out from the podium and Comrade X punched the air repeatedly as the conference hall erupted.  After visiting Anfield at the weekend, it was perhaps inevitable that Red John, the son of a Liverpool docker, would go one step further and quote the footballing legend Bill Shankly.  He declared: \u0026ldquoWhenever the General Election comes, we are ready. Ready to campaign for victory, ready for Government, ready to build the future.

It seemed clear Comrade X was an Evertonian."},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood-plan-to-make-20mph-limit-the-urban-norm","story":"  Launching his Safer Streets member\u0026rsquos Bill, Green MSP Mark Ruskell said he wanted to see a \u0026ldquosocial and cultural change in attitudes towards road safety akin to that around seat belts.  If passed, the Bill would flip the current system in towns and cities, where the default limit is generally 30mph, but councils can apply to restrict it to 20mph in specic areas.  Under the proposal, the default limit would instead become 20mph, and councils would have to apply to make it 30mph.  The change would affect the C-class and unclassied local roads which make up around 60 per cent of all UK highways, but not arterial A and B class roads.  The idea has the support of around two dozen MSPs from all the parties at Holyrood bar the Tories, as well as support from the leaders of Glasgow and Edinburgh city councils.  The Scottish Government has not endorsed it, saying it believes councils are best placed to decide speed limits on the local roads they oversee, but will now examine more evidence.  The Bill documents say the expected costs to councils, principally signage, would be around \u0026pound22m, based on previous small-scale roll-outs.  However a 10% fall in accidents could save the public purse close to \u0026pound40m in police, NHS and economic costs, and previous trials have seen a 20% fall in accidents and fatalities.  People are seven times less likely to die  hit by a vehicle travelling at 20 rather than 30mph.  Campaigners for the change also say it would help reduce pollution and encourage more people to walk and cycle, because they would feel less threatened by traffic speeds.  Mr Ruskell said that  the Bill received strong support at Holyrood is could become law by the end of 2019, then phased in after a further 18 months.  He said: \"As a local councillor and as an MSP I have seen first-hand the frustration of communities that want lower speed limits but find the current process overly-complicated.  \u0026ldquoBy making 20 the norm in built-up areas we can end this frustration and provide the clarity that residents and motorists deserve.  Mark Beaumont, who became the fastest round-the-world cyclist by cycling 18,000 miles in under 79 days, said: \"It\u0027s great to see Mark Ruskell\u0027s bill in the Scottish Parliament helping build the momentum on this issue and I hope we see it become law in the near future. This is about saving lives, reducing injuries and improving public health and enjoyment by making our streets safer and healthier places to cycle and walk.  \u0026ldquoThe current system of patchwork 20mph zones is time-consuming and costly for local councils, and confusing for road users. Scotland has a real chance to take a lead on this so let\u0026rsquos go for it.  Emilia Hanna of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: \u0026ldquo20mph zones make our streets safer and fairer for everyone using them, and are a vital part of the solution to air pollution.  \u0026ldquoThe faster people drive, the greater the risk of accidents, and the more off-putting it is for people to walk and cycle. Cars dominate our streets far too much already.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a much more level playing field between pedestrians, cyclists, public transport users and drivers. Slowing traffic is a key way to achieve this.  But Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: \u0026ldquoTo take drivers along with them the authorities need to explain not only what they are doing to improve safety but also how the changes will make people\u0026rsquos journeys smoother and more reliable.  \u0026ldquoThere will be many urban roads in Scotland where, given the congestion, drivers couldn\u0026rsquot get up to 20 mph even  they were allowed to.  from Neil Grieg, Director of Policy and Research at IAM Roadsmart, said: \u0026ldquoAll roads dfer in their form and  at a very detailed level and the limit should reflect that.  \u0026ldquoThis is why IAM RoadSmart does not favour a blanket approach to speed limits or a wholesale change in the urban limit from 30 to 20.  \u0026ldquoIf you want to change driver behaviour you need to spend more and change the character of the road. That means more high quality surfacing and shared space. Drivers will get the message and share the road even more safely than they do already.  A spokesperson for government quango Transport Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe are clear that 20 mile per hour speed limits are a good idea when implemented in the right environment.  \u0026ldquoGiven the ied nature of Scotland\u0027s urban road network and the number of factors which need considered when setting appropriate limits, we believe decisions on 20 mph speed limits are best taken at the local authority level.  \u0026ldquoThe Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity met with Mark Ruskell MSP regarding his plans to bring forward a Member\u0026rsquos Bill on 20 mph speed limits and we look forward to seeing the detail of any legislative proposals submitted to Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"worker-sacked-after-crackdown-on-duty-free-goods","story":"  Bruce Mackie worked for a bonded warehouse in Aberdeen, delivering duty-free goods to boats sailing out of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Macduff harbours.  However, officials clamped down on sales in January this year after it emerged not all of the vessels were entitled to the cheap supplies - meaning his employers suffered a 50 per cent drop in business.  Mr Mackie, from Stonehaven, was forced to resign when bosses at Butlers Ship Stores Ltd cut his hours and pay in half.  He has now won his case for constructive and unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal.  Employment judge Alexander Kemp said: \"Whilst they are a very small company, and faced a particularly challenging set of circumstances with the changes to their business... I consider that in all the circumstances there was an unfair dismissal.\"  Under HMRC guidelines, bonded  goods can be sold to fishing vessels sailing to destinations outwith a designated area.  However, officials discovered that not all of the boats buying the cheap alcohol and tobacco were travelling to those areas.  A written judgment on the case states: \"Fishing vessels which were supplied by the firm required to sail north of latitude 61 degrees in order to qualy for duty free.  \"Technological advances and other changes allowed HMRC to track vessels\u0027 movements, and it became clear to HMRC that some vessels did not sail north of that line, and thus were not entitled to receive bonded goods free of duty, but had been doing so.\"  The judgment adds: \"HMRC began to enforce the provisions more strictly particularly from December 2017 and let that be known to the fishing community.  \"Fishing vessels which did not sail north of the 61 degrees north line of latitude were informed that  they received bonded goods to which they were not entitled, they would be subject to enforcement action by HMRC.\"  Officials visited Butlers Ship Stores in January and explained that many of the boats supplied by the firm were no longer entitled to duty free.  As a result of the crackdown, the company experienced a drastic drop in orders, with turnover failing from an average of \u0026pound119,000 per month to just over \u0026pound55,000 per month.  In February, Mr Mackie was called in by his bosses and told that the downturn meant there was not enough work to employ a driver full time.  They cut his hours from 40 to 20 per week and halved his salary.  The driver resigned soon after, claiming the company had breached his contract.  Judge Kemp ruled that the company should have treated Mr Mackie\u0027s situation as a redundancy and given notice and consultation as appropriate.  However, because they did not so this, the worker was constructively and unfairly dismissed.

The troubled project was put on a \"pause\" last March when it was facing spiralling costs, many posed by the complex site: on a hill, in a major public park, under a listed building and close to a major railway line.  Now the galleries  have unveiled a new conception of the revamp, which will create new galleries for the display of Scottish art, and a complete rehang of the gallery space.  It will open in early 2021.  : When Galleries pressed \u0027pause\u0027 on revamp project  The galleries have long wanted to change the display of Scottish art at the National Gallery, which for many years was shown in a \"cramped and dark\" concrete basement.  Work will begin in October, and the NGS say that the galleries will remain open throughout the redevelopment project.  However, to enable excavation works to the galleries directly beneath, the notable Playfair Steps, at the rear of the National Gallery, will be closed for the duration of the building work.  The Playfair Steps, designed by William Henry Playfair, are an historic steep flight of steps from the Mound to Market Street, and are often busy, especially during the Festival.  The new galleries, with large windows running the  of the new Princes Street Gardens facade, will have a \"broader\" look at Scottish art, and will open in 2021.  : Stop and start history of landmark revamp project  They will feature the art of Allan Ramsay, Gavin Hamilton and Sir David Wilkie, as well as 20th century artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Stanley Cursiter and the Scottish Colourists S J Peploe and F C B Cadell.  The plan will involve \"extensive new landscaping in the gardens\", as well as a larger shop, and a new cafe.  The galleries say that once open, they will have a \"dedicate family day\" one daya a week, and more volunteers working in the galleries.  The first sign of the revamp will be construction work in October, followed by a new coffee shop at Christmas, and new steps and paths by next spring.  Funds for the revamp are from the National Lottery, worth \u0026pound4.9m, and the Scottish Government, worth \u0026pound5,5, as well as signicant fund raising.  : Director previously hoped for 2020 re-opening  Sir John Leighton, director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland, said: \"This is a hugely exciting time for us, as we see our ambitious plans for the Scottish National Gallery getting underway.  \"We will create the perfect showcase for the nation\u0026rsquos extraordinary collection of Scottish art, giving it room to breathe and showing it off with real pride to the world.  \"This ambitious project will completely transform the experience of our visitors, creating a National Gallery that is even more open, engaging and inviting with new presentations of Scotland\u0026rsquos art in a setting that will be truly world-class.\"  Dr Tricia Allerston, co-director of the Scottish National Gallery Project, said that visitor numbers to the Scottish National Gallery have almost \"doubled in the past ten years but fewer than one in six of them made their way to the cramped, dark spaces which used to house the national collection of Scottish art.\"  She added: \"Soon, visitors will be able easily to discover, appreciate and enjoy our highly signicant collections of Scottish art through a series of innovative displays designed expressly to engage them.  \"Imagine looking at a painting of Sir Walter Scott and then looking out of the windows into Princes Street Gardens, a landscape created during his letime and which is now dominated by the great monument marking his international fame.\"  : Sir John Leighton on national gallery\u0026nbsprevamp plans  The designs for the revamp are by Hoskins Architects.

The self-styled Corbynista insisted that society should \u0026ldquostop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting them on the basis of class.  He insisted the \u0026ldquoreal ision in Britain was not between Scotland and England but between the wealth owners and the wealth creators.  Deriding the Tories\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquofervent devotion to inequality and the Nationalists\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquotimidity and mediocrity, the Central Scotland MSP said it was time for \"moral courage and audacity\" from Labour and proposed a wealth tax on Scotland\u0026rsquos wealthiest 10 per cent, which, he calculated, would raised \u0026pound3.7 billion for public services.  On land reform, he said Labour had unfinished business and that after abolishing feudalism in the first term of the Scottish Parliament the nation was still living with \u0026ldquofeudal ownership with 432 private landowners owning half of privately-owned land in Scotland.  Describing the earth as a \u0026ldquocommon treasure, he insisted what was needed was land ownership in Scotland for the many and not the few.  A Scottish Labour government would introduce a new Land Reform Act to break up the dominance of private landowners and will look at the possibility of introducing a tax on land value, capping the amount on landowners\u0026rsquo beneficial interest and a residential requirement on absentee landowners.  Mr Leonard also pledged to overhaul state aid for business, Regional Selective Assistance[RSA], to provide more support for local industries and home-grown businesses after the crisis with marine energy company BiFab, which left communities facing ruin as hundreds of workers were threatened with redundancy earlier this year.  He party leader stressed how reform of RSA would prevent foreign-owned companies continuing to benefit from nearly twice as much RSA than Scottish companies.

And so it goes on \u0026hellip and on \u0026hellip until Judgement Day.  The sprawl of referenda facing us makes the map of New York\u0026rsquos subway system seem understandable. Labour members want a second referendum, a People\u0026rsquos Vote, on the Brexit deal, which may, or may not, include a question about staying in the EU. However, Labour won\u0026rsquot allow Scotland to have a second independence referendum. How does that work? A second referendum on the EU is okay, but not a second referendum on independence? That\u0026rsquos a straight-up fail in logic class.  Then we come to the SNP \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a big push for the First Minister to back a second People\u0026rsquos Vote, but she\u0026rsquos not committing. That\u0026rsquos probably because the party is committed to a second Scottish independence referendum \u0026ndash although, when that might be, we don\u0026rsquot know \u0026ndash and some worry a People\u0026rsquos Vote will set the precedent that a future independence referendum can be overturned.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot make sense either. If pro-independence folk push for a second independence referendum, then why shouldn\u0026rsquot Unionists push for a third in the event the No side loses, or push for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on any independence \u0026ldquodeal? If you want a second indyref, then why not back a second EU vote? Why not a third vote on Brexit called by the Brexiters  they lose a People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash why not just keep going until I have grandchildren in middle age? Why not just keep going until we are all driven stark staring mad?  We\u0026rsquore now playing referendum Jenga \u0026ndash piling up phoney choice on phoney choice in a rickety tower that cannot stay stable, and it\u0026rsquos democracy which is at risk of tumbling down.  I spit my curse on referenda not because of sour grapes \u0026ndash my side got beaten in two votes. I support Scottish independence, and I support remaining in Europe. I spit my curse on referenda because I see more of them coming in the future, and  we think we\u0026rsquore ided and unhappy now, wait and see how we feel when we\u0026rsquove been through one or two or three more.  Let\u0026rsquos stick with losers like me for a moment. We got beaten 45-55 over independence and 48-52 over Europe. Look at those margins. In Scotland, 45 per cent of the population were left with their dreams crushed. In the UK, 48 per cent had their world pulled from under them. Should 55 per cent of the population have the right to leave 45 per cent sitting in the corner crying? Should 52 per cent have the power to trash the house of the other 48 per cent?  This is the tyranny of the majority \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquove long been thinking about what it would have been like  the shoe was on the other foot. I hope I would have felt empathy for a defeated Unionist or a Brexiter. Their political positions are not wicked \u0026ndash both are legitimate, decent opinions to hold \u0026ndash but the binary black and white of referenda puts the boot well and truly into the face of empathy. No-one walks in another person\u0026rsquos shoes when it comes to a referendum, you steal their shoes, tie their laces together and fling them over a telegraph pole in spite.  It may sound crazy given the public mood, it may even sound anti-democratic, for which I ask forgiveness, but perhaps this whole clunking winner-takes-all referenda path we\u0026rsquore on is deeply damaging to democracy. No matter what side of the fence you sit on \u0026ndash pro-independence, pro-Union pro-Europe, anti-Europe \u0026ndash you cannot say that the choices we\u0026rsquove made and the way those choices have been acted upon has been beneficial to the common good. It\u0026rsquos a bitter mess from Caithness to Cornwall.  Would it be better  referenda were settled with a 60-40 win? At least then the utter crushing of the losing side would not be so deadly and isive. If 60 per cent of the population told me I was wrong over independence and Europe, then perhaps it would have been more palatable. When Yes lost I felt as  a dream had evaporated because I was looking to the future \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost what I never had. When the Brexiters won I was bereft as I felt part of my identity had been stolen \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost something very tangible. Pull a switcheroo, and imagine that Yes won, or Brexiters lost, and you can see the same unhappiness across the ide: Unionists robbed of identity, anti-European dreams dashed.  But the ghost is out of the bottle. We can\u0026rsquot stop this chain reaction of referendum leading to referendum, nor can we tweak the rules \u0026ndash once we\u0026rsquove started down this path the road must remain level. So, on we will go, vote after vote, a slim minority of people hurt and thrust into the cold, a slim majority gloating in victory \u0026hellip until calls for new votes start again.  This is a Naked Lunch moment \u0026ndash a frozen moment when everyone sees exactly what is on the end of their fork. What I see is that we\u0026rsquove embraced endless ision, that we\u0026rsquore happy to hurt the other side on an existential level, that we cannot empathise with those who hold dfering political views \u0026ndash and that is because we brought in the blind god of referenda to stand in place of the slow grind of discussion. Change happens, it always does, but over these last years we wanted to light a fire under change, to turbo-charge its engine \u0026ndash all we\u0026rsquove really done is blow the bloody doors off the car."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-dont-like-immigration-better-stick-with-the-union","story":"  Take the SNP. The ruling party has long been making noises that Scotland - and an independent Scotland in particular - needs an influx of working-age immigrants to keep its economy afloat, and earlier this year it made the case for Scotland taking control of its own borders regardless of whether it remains part of the UK or not.  The bid has met with a mixed response from the public, with respected pollster Sir John Curtice finding in January that 63 per cent of Scots wanted to keep the same immigration rules as the UK, while a report issued last week by the National Conversation on Immigration suggested that practically the same proportion  now back immigration devolution.  Part of the reason for the flip-flopping is likely to do with the focus on the benefits immigration brings to the economy as a whole, with little attention given to how it impacts on us inidually. Yet you only need to look at the state pension, a benefit every one of us should expect to receive sooner or later, to see the dference greater immigration could make.  It is no secret that Scotland has a rapidly ageing population and in its Sustainable Growth Commission report the SNP noted that while the country\u0026rsquos pensioner population is expected to grow by 28% in the next 25 years the working-age population will grow by just 1%. This matters because, contrary to popular opinion, our tax and national insurance contributions are not being collected in inidual state-pension pots to be paid out on retirement, but rather are being used to fund current pensioners\u0026rsquo monthly payments, just as future generations\u0026rsquo taxes will be used to pay ours. It also matters in the context of the independence debate because in the UK as a whole the pensioner population is expected to grow by 33% and the working-age population by 11%, meaning the need for increased immigration, while still there, is less pressing.  The implication of this is clear: without a marked increase in the working-age population, an independent Scotland would be unable to continue paying the state pension - a benefit we should all be entitled to in some shape or form \u0026ndash without taking drastic, and electorally unpopular, action such as increasing taxes or raising the retirement age.  We all know how popular the former idea is, and the UK Government\u0026rsquos plan to press ahead with the latter has met with signicant opposition north of the Border due to le expectancy in some parts of Scotland being so low. Increasing immigration, and so the tax take, would have the potential to negate the need for doing either.  Of course this is all moot for now, with a Home Office-commissioned report issued last week by the independent Migration Advisory Committee concluding that \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is [not] sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  There will be some in the yes campaign that say this only strengthens the argument for independence, but the problem is that those shouting loudest for a second referendum appear to be the least likely to embrace an increase in immigration on any scale, let alone the scale an independent Scotland would require in order to thrive.  It should come as no surprise that there exists a scepticism towards incomers when a hard-core of indy supporters so vocally hanker after a country that is ours alone. Indeed, ahead of the 2014 independence referendum St Andrews academic David McCollum led a study that found \u0026ldquoevidence of some  hostility towards migration on the part of the general public in Scotland and a possible link between nationalist leanings and opposition to \u0026lsquoOthers\u0026rsquo. This opposition appears to have crystallised into the backward-looking \u0026lsquothis land is our land-ism\u0026rsquo of the kind of die-hard secessionist who believes that screening Mel Gibson\u0026rsquos Braveheart at a rally will strengthen the indy cause.  Regardless of political stance, as an electorate we are always asked to make binary decisions - him or her, red or blue, in or out, yes or no - when the implications of those decisions are anything but black and white. In the normal course of events backing the wrong horse doesn\u0026rsquot matter too much because another election will always come along to let you change your mind. With referendums, however, the decision is far more binding, meaning voters will have to sacrice some of their beliefs in favour of other, more palatable ones.  While some in the electorate may have independence at the top of their wish list and will do anything to get the chance to vote for it, the truth is that  immigration is not up there with it then even the staunchest of independentistas would be better off sticking with the UK, in all its Brexity glory."},{"url":null,"title":"turning-glasgow-on-to-health-benefits-of-vegetables","story":"  A lack of fruit and vegetables in our diet has been identied as one of the major causes of serious illness, yet Glasgow\u0026rsquos consumption of vegetables in some areas is falling at an alarming rate.

GCFN chairwoman Abi Mordin said: \u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to see what can be grown in the city.

ISGD will provide businesses with the chance to shape their own event around the day.The Gin Cooperative Co-Founder Natalie Reid said: “Scotland as a food and drink producing country is seen as a benchmark for quality, so we wanted to create a day that celebrates Scottish Gin that’s distilled in Scotland and promoted as being Scottish with co-ordinated events with gin makers, bars and more.“It’s also a fantastic chance for some of Scotland’s food \u0026amp drink agencies, tourist agencies and businesses dedicated to promoting Scotland to play their own unique part in the story of Scottish Gin.”“We view International Scottish Gin Day as a unique opportunity that can bring commercial benefits to the many great bars, restaurants and bottle shops not just here in Scotland but across the rest of the UK and further afield.”                                                                                                        The Gin Cooperative was established earlier this year by Natalie along with her husband Martin.The business works with Scottish Gin Makers to tell their story and the broader story of Scottish Gin to consumers across the world.Natalie explained: “We currently have the world’s largest Scottish Gin directory and the world’s largest dedicated Scottish Gin website.“As a business, The Gin Cooperative promotes the story of Scottish Gin with the support of Scottish Gin makers who have a listing on our directory.                                                                                                        “We currently feature over 190 inidually profiled Scottish Gins with more being added every few weeks.“From day one, one of the objectives of the business was to establish a day that would provide the opportunity to showcase how fantastic Scottish Gin really is to a global audience.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s military band is heading for aberdeen","story":"        Scotland\u0026#8217s best-known military band is in the midst of its first-ever national tour \u0026#8211 and is set perform in Aberdeen at the end of the month.

Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.                                                     Members of the band local to the area recently joined Aberdeen Provost Barney Crockett and the Poppyscotland team to spread the word about the eagerly anticipated concert.        Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world. September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low.

From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online. However, Ms Oag believes it is leading to a surge in the number of abandoned and ill-treated animals.\"It\u0027s not fair on them to be sold alongside kids\u0027 bikes and unused furniture,\" she said. \"Too many people are just not taking responsibility.

In Orkney, 128 tonnes of plastic bottles are incinerated every year.Here in Orkney, OIC\u0026#8217s waste team will be carrying out a number of activities including a drop-in at Tesco on Monday, visits to local schools, as well as sharing recycling information and tips on its Facebook and Twitter feeds.The team will be also be encouraging local people to take part in the Scottish Government’s national consultation on a deposit  scheme on disposable drinks containers for Scotland.OIC’s project coordination manager for waste, Jayne Venables, believes that small improvements in Orkney’s recycling rates could make a huge dference.She says for every one per cent extra material that is recycled, the council can save up to £12,500 on waste disposal costsIain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland added: “Recycle Week is the ideal opportunity to do more to make sure we’re recycling as much as we can.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 1:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804970.1537873330!/image/image.jpg","title":"life expectancy in scotland decreases for first time","story":"        Growth in le expectancy in the UK has come to a halt - and has decreased in Scotland for the first time, new figures show.

Le expectancy in some parts of the UK has actually decreased.For males and females in Scotland and Wales it has declined by 0.1 years, while males in Northern Ireland have seen a similar fall.For females in Northern Ireland, and for males and females in England, le expectancy at birth is unchanged.Sophie Sanders, of the ONS Centre for Ageing and Demography, said the figures represented “the lowest improvements in le expectancy since the start of the series in 1980 to 1982”. - Man jailed after attempted murder of six children in hit-and-run            “This slowing in improvements is reflected in the chances of surviving to age 90 years from birth, which has also seen virtually no improvement since 2012 to 2014,” she added.Le expectancy in the UK remains lower than in many other comparable countries internationally, the ONS also found.The figures were described as “concerning” by Janet Morrison, chief executive of Independent Age, the older people’s charity.“More must be done to understand what is driving this,” she said. “These figures starkly highlight the need for health and care services to adapt to our ageing population, and the government must ensure that these services can support people to live long, healthy, happy lives.”            Of the four nations in the UK, Scotland has the lowest le expectancy for a baby born in 2015-17, with 77.0 years for males and 81.1 years for females.England has the highest le expectancy: 79.5 years for males and 83.1 years for females.The figures for Northern Ireland are 78.4 for males and 82.3 for females, and for Wales the numbers are 78.3 for males and 82.3 for females.There is no simple answer to why growth in le expectancy has stalled, the ONS suggests.But it notes there has been a “signicant” slowdown in improving mortality rates.             - Millionaire footballer steps in to help bullied Glasgow schoolboyThe three-year period from 2015 to 2017 saw particularly high numbers of deaths across the UK in comparison with the years before.In England and Wales, 2015 saw the largest annual percentage increase in deaths since 1968 - a rise that coincided with the peak in flu activity for the 2014/15 season.In 2016, deaths were slightly lower but remained high in comparison with the majority of the 2000s.And in 2017, deaths spiked again as the highest number of deaths were registered in England and Wales since 2003.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

Rather than graty him by repeatedly referring to his meanderings, I’ll use them as a jump-off point to explain why ­Brian Beacom’s rant is not only unhelpful to women, but also to discussion about the other side of the gender coin: masculinity.            In this age of growing awareness of the myriad challenges many women face, I am trying to reason as honestly and openly as I can. I feel it is my responsibility to look beyond the first emotional impulse on any given issue and try to see the bigger picture.             Admittedly, this hasn’t been an easy road, and especially true where gender is ­concerned. It took me a long time to reconcile the ­personal experience of feeling frightened by women as a kid with the political and cultural reality that many of the challenges, prejudices and threats women face are – like many of the roles assigned to them by society – a direct result of their gender. The notion that so many ­women feel powerless, threatened or afraid was hard to map onto my own experience, where women always appeared to be in charge – sometimes ruling with an iron fist. Realising the personal and political are not mutually exclusive has been bumpy and sometimes frightening. In the age of social media it requires almost no effort to be extremely uncharitable, whether dishing it out or on the receiving end. Beacom makes a mockery of those of us who are grappling with matters of gender and masculinity, sometimes counterintuitively. It takes a lot of work  to resist hardwired reactions to a cascade of conflicting social media posts, blogs, articles and news stories. Where, often, men are discussed in generalities that do not account for the specicity of our experiences and where we are often commanded to “talk about our feelings” and “stop making it all about us” simultaneously. It was hard for me to accept, for example, that my mother’s aggression and violence towards me was, as I have heard it said, simply another form of toxic masculinity – that her abusive behaviour was rooted in trauma she experienced at the hands of men when she was a young woman. I had a lot of baggage to unpack and as I did so, much of it on public platforms, I was accosted on occasion. Sometimes my assailants had a point. Sometimes that point was drowned out by social media hyperbole. Ironically, the people who were most helpful, compassionate and understanding were other feminists who valued a willingness to ­examine my own attitudes and behaviour over a carefully constructed avatar that always knew the wokest thing to say.I licked my wounds and kept going. All around me I could see once powerful men being recontextualised as predators and abusers. One thing they all had in common was a seemingly sincere belief that they had done nothing wrong. It struck me that, just because I didn’t regard myself as ever harming, harassing or abusing anybody, this didn’t automatically mean I hadn’t. But this is a dficult thing to confront, especially in the public domain, when you are caught in the crossfire between two types of men who are always engaged in the ­discussion around gender.            In one corner, we have the woke bros. They are a good lot. They use whatever means available to echo the sentiments expressed by progressive women. They observe the day’s contested gender story through a feminist lens and are keen to be seen publicly standing in solidarity with whatever their comrades think. You’ll find them right across the political spectrum and, ostensibly, they were born with all the correct opinions and attitudes installed – because we never hear how they came to be so woke. Also, you rarely hear anything from them about their experiences as men, in relation to women. Nothing about what they struggle with, or those attitudes and behaviours in their private lives that haven’t always so conveniently aligned with their public proclamations. Apparently, we are to believe these guys have never intruded on a woman’s privacy out of emotional insecurity, never gratied themselves to ethically nightmarish porn and never harboured a hateful thought or said or done something that berated, hurt, pressured or harmed a woman.  Some of them even want us to accept that we live in a patriarchy that infects all who emerge from it with misogynistic impulses, but that they, themselves, are strangely unaffected.Maybe I’m just jealous because I am so evidently flawed. But while I am sure the many women with whom the woke bros stand in solidarity are thrilled to see their allies batting for the right team, the woke bros are virtually useless when it comes to engaging sections of the male population who, like me, have not been so perfectly configured, men who perhaps sense that they must change but require guidance from other men on the path – as opposed to Twitter pointers from men who only speak publicly about other behaviour and not their own. Then we have Brian Beacom types. Men who’ll go to the grave believing the song and dance they made about gender equality was a valiant cry from the wilderness – and not the agonal gasp of a privileged but increasingly irrelevant perspective. Somewhere between the woke bros and the Beacoms, sit men like me, trying to carve out a new lane where a more honest and potentially vulnerable conversation about masculinity must take place. Which is what must happen  the struggle for gender equality is ever to arrive at its final destination.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804714.1537815363!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment labour party line offers little hope","story":"        The Labour Party conference will this afternoon vote on whether to \u0026#8220keep all options on the table\u0026#8221 when it comes to Brexit.                This aspiration, broad and vague as it is, may include the possibility of campaigning for a new referendum. But before any frustrated Remainers get too excited, it’s worth paying attention to the detail. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and is closest allies at the top of the party are no more enthusiastic about the possibility of a second referendum than they were yesterday.            Keeping all options on the table is language of the most non-committal nature. Anyone who would like to truly understand the Labour leadership’s position should pay attention to remarks made early yesterday by shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who said any so-called “People’s Vote” should be on the terms of the Brexit deal rather than on whether the UK should, in fact, remain part of the EU.            Labour Party members may yesterday have waved banners reading “Hate Brexit – Love Corbyn” but the very most it seems they can hope from the party leadership is support for a referendum which offers a choice between whatever deal Theresa May is able to salvage from the chaos - and a potentially-catastrophic no deal.Later yesterday, Mr McDonnell adopted the “all options on the table” party line but the truth was already out there.  When Mr Corbyn succeeded Ed Miliband as Labour leader in 2015, he promised a new kind of politics but it is becoming increasingly apparent that with increased trade union influence and the centralising of power to a small clique, the modern Labour party is the living breathing example of what we might consider the old politics. And the bad old politics, at that.Prime Minister Theresa May limps on, politically wounded by treacherous colleagues, humiliated by the EU, and struggling to find a vaguely plausible narrative on Brexit. Add to this unfortunate mix polling which shows growing support to reverse the decision take in 2016, and Labour is presented with the opportunity to seize the initiative, and perhaps even help the UK avert the worst impact of Brexit. Yet still he refuses to show leadership.Jeremy Corbyn may have convinced his supporters that they all have a voice in his party. Those who do not parrot the leadership line on Brexit should not, however, expect to be listened to.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804670.1537807783!/image/image.jpg","title":"labour conference richard leonard sets out plan to target the wealthy","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

A Labour government in Scotland would ring-fence hundreds of millions of pounds of state aid funding for foreign-owned businesses and redirect it towards Scottish companies to re-train staff and save manufacturing jobs, Richard Leonard has said.

And he said a Labour government would raise £3.7bn for public services through a ‘windfall’ tax on the richest iniduals in Scotland.Mr Leonard, who has recommitted Labour to opposing a second Scottish independence referendum, used his first UK conference speech since becoming leader to accuse nationalists of distracting from the fight for economic equality.“We know that the forces that threaten the le chances of children growing up by the Mersey, are the same ones that threaten the le chances of children growing up by the Clyde,” Mr Leonard said. “So we should stop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting them on the basis of class.”Adding that he “fully intends” to become the next First Minister of Scotland despite questions about his Yorkshire background, Mr Leonard added: “The real ision in our society is not between Scotland and England, it is between those people who own the wealth and those people who through their hard work and endeavour create the wealth.”            • : Richard Leonard: Labour will deliver federal UK and oppose Indyref2He confirmed plans to impose a windfall tax on the richest 10 per cent of Scots, as well as redirecting state aid money to firms like recently-defunct Burntisland Fabrications, in order to retrain workforces and retool industrial sites.Labour pointed to figures from Scottish Enterprise showing that since coming to power, the SNP have handed out £222.6m in Regional Selective Assistance  to foreign-owned companies, compared to £140.7m that has gone to Scottish-owned firms.The total amount of RAS has also fallen by 80 per cent since 2007.            On land reform, Mr Leonard said Labour had “unfinished business”, and said he would consider plans for a land value tax, a cap on beneficial interest, and a residency requirement for absentee landlords as part of a “radical” Land Reform Act.“Labour abolished feudalism in the first term of the Scottish Parliament, but twenty years later we are still living with feudal ownership, with four hundred and thirty-two private landowners still owning a half of all privately owned land in Scotland,” the Scottish Labour leader said. “With ownership comes power. We need land justice because our earth is a common treasury. We need land ownership in Scotland, for the many not the few.”The SNP claimed Labour’s proposed windfall tax would hit pensioners hardest.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nTuesday 25 Sep 2018 1:41 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbsp\n\nFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.\nIt is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.\nLaunched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.\nThe service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.\nFair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.\nThis means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.\nThe service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.\nDelivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.\nJamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\n\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\n\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"\nOne of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .\nHe has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.\nAlan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.  - Matt Carthy MEP\nSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. \nThe Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from 11am tomorrow. \nIt will feature two panel discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible and  a unity referendum could be won. \nPanellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. \nThe panel discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. \nSpeakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. \nIt is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. \nSpeaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \n\"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \n\"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \n\"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \n\"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan Kearney\nTheannual British-Irish Association  conference convened last weekend inOxford, England.\nAt thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.\nOnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  \nTheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.\nTheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.\nThe RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that party\u0027s purportedadherence to \u0027good governance’.\nIanPaisley\u0027s misconduct \u0026amp discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.\nThe DUPjust does not get it!\n\nThatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on 9th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.\nYet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.\nAndeven  the British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.\nInreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.\nThey have already decided the party should notcontest the 2019 local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.\nIn myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that 25years of progress could be squandered.\nIrepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.\nThefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.\n\nAnd thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.\nThereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.\nSinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined.

the Game Of Thrones legacy project coming to Northern Ireland.\n\n“While fans have seen the stunning landscapes, coastlines and mountains in the series, we are thrilled they will now have the opportunity to fully experience the charm of Northern Ireland and immerse themselves into the world of Westeros.\n\n“The Game Of Thrones legacy project will be a game changer for Northern Ireland on a

demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help? They are being left on the scrapheap and that’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nJackie is urging women who need help and advice about vaginal mesh implants to contact her via her Facebook page ‘TVT POP Mesh Problems N Ireland’ or by email: meshgirlni@icloud\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8639705.1537348575!/image/image.jpg","title":"storm ali latest motorists advised that m1 has reopened","story":"                \nEarlier the motorway was closed in both directions between Lisburn and Blacks Road due to a power line down across the road.\n\nwindow.twttr =  [0],    t = window.twttr ||      t  js = d.createElement  js.id = id  js.src = \"https:platform.twitter/widgets.js\"  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore   t._e = []  t.ready =        t\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n.tweety\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEarlier a post on PSNI Banbridge Facebook said: \"This will cause signicant disruption so please find an alternative route.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Please share.\"\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nA PSNI spokesman added: \"M1 Motorway is closed westbound from Black\u0027s Road Dunmurry and east bound from Saintfield Road due to fallen cables.\n\n\"Motorists should seek alternative routes. \n\n\"Saintfield Road is also closed at the junction of the old Ballynahinch Road due to a fallen tree. \n\n\"Motorists are advised to exercise extreme caution in adverse weather conditions.

Michael explained how the runaway success of his creation has seen views of up to 900,000 on the page, and that his characters are now set to come to le at the Waterfront in October.\n“I grew up with three older sisters, I’m the only boy and the youngest so a lot of my inspiration has come from my family, I’ve seen and heard it all,” he laughed.\n“The Facebook page has become so successful that it makes you want to do more, keep creating, keep entertaining people. I remember when I posted the first video and people were commenting underneath saying ‘more, more’.”\nMichael’s only foray on the stage so far was “when I was in Primary Seven in St Kevin’s and I wore my mummy’s white skinny jeans to play the Angel Gabriel,” he laughed.\n“I feel brilliant that I’m going to be performing all the characters for the first time at the Waterfront. I’ve never seen anything like this, like the following the site has, it’s crazy, but good crazy,” he said.\nThe show will be directed by Alan McKee, one half of comedic duo Grimes and McKee, and himself no stranger to the director’s chair.\n“Joe Rea, who is producing the show, spoke to me about Michael and said ‘this guy is very funny, I think there is a show here’. I ran Michael’s page past the focus group of teenage girls in my house and they loved it, there are plenty of songs and dance routines for everyone to take part in.\n“The fact we are putting on the show shows the power of social media, you can’t ignore that number of hits, that amount of likes and views.\n“Michael has a great ear, he writes exactly the way people speak, warts and all. He is a really original voice.\n“This is the first time I’m directing a piece that has come this way and it has really opened my eyes to look out for other things that don’t necessarily come via the traditional route,  it’s good people will pick up on it. It’s a version of word of mouth just how successful Belfast Girls has become which is the best publicity you can get.”\nBelfast Girls will be performed at the Waterfront from October 9-20.

He just went from a child to an adult.\n\n“As he grew up as an adult, he turned to a spiral of drink and drugs. He thought it was helping him but in reality it wasn’t. He didn’t know when to stop.\n\n“His doctor wrote him a letter, basically saying could he be housed in some sort of sheltered accommodation. It never happened.\n\n“As parents, we were desperate. He was either sitting in his room or out on the drink and drugs.\n\n“He couldn’t get out of the loop he was in. He needed serious help and he just was not getting it. It was a constant cycle that was going downwards. He needed professional help to deal with the grief he suffered.”\n\nIn April, Billy and Sharon were told by Social Services that it was not safe for Sebastian to live in the family home with his younger brother  and three sisters, ,  and .\n\n“As  putting him on to the street was the solution for a vulnerable adult who has addiction and mental health problems,” added Billy. “Social Services’ attitude was basically Sebastian is out of the house and the kids are safe. Now their big brother is dead. They are going to need counselling. It is just a vicious circle.\n\n“We are terried of a knock-on effect. What  someone else in our family decides to take their own le? We were given no help to find him somewhere. We had to find him some sort of sheltered dwelling to live in.”\n\nOn August 13, Sebastian’s West Belfast flat and the Haggan family home were raided by police who claimed they had a warrant to search for ammunition and weapons. The family have complained about the searches to the Police Ombudsman. Sebastian took his own le just five days later and Billy believes the raid set him over the edge. \n\n“Sebastian was out on the streets again after the raid when his landlord put him out. I got him sorted with a place in Ballymena. Five days after the raid, he killed himself. I think it was a trigger – he just could not cope with any more stress.\n\n“He was found with heroin paraphernalia lying around him. We are still waiting on official confirmation but it seems pretty likely he took a heroin overdose to end his own le. Earlier this year, he told his sister the best way to commit suicide was a heroin overdose. He was right.”\nBilly and Sharon have criticised the system which they say is failing people suffering from mental health issues.\n“Sebastian needed professional help but it just was not there. We begged for help from a psychiatrist and for him to be sectioned but nobody would do it.\n\n“We think he attempted suicide on three occasions before. After the second attempt when his sister rescued him from jumping off a bridge, the hospital said he was ‘stable’ and that he ‘wasn’t that bad’. \n\nSebastian himself was willing himself to get help. What more did he need to do? He’d just tried to take his own le. The authorities need to listen to families who are suffering. The system has crashed, it simply does not exist. Hospitals just cannot deal with the issue. \n\nPoliticians need to start doing something. There is a deluge of mental health patients at the moment and basically no help out there for them. Nobody seems to want to tackle the problem. More mental health staff and teams are needed.\n\n “We tried everything we could. At the end of the day, Sebastian was the one who injected himself and killed himself but it all goes back to mental health issues. \n\n“We won’t be the last family to suffer. I wouldn’t like to think what the total number of suicides will rise to. There are more people killed by suicide than on the roads now.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues in this article, call Leline on 0808 808 8000 or PIPS on 02890 805850.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"west belfast man wont face second trial","story":"\n\nA man\n who admitted preventing the lawful burial of his elderly neighbour will not face a trial for stealing a second bank card from her burgled flat.\nSentencing of Robert Sharkey, 24, originally of Larkspur Rise, will take place next month.\nHe was convicted of 11 charges, including using one of Marie Conlon\u0026#8217s debit cards to buy nearly £6,000 worth of pizza.\nA remaining charge of theft of a debit card will remain on the books.\nThe remains of 68-year-old Ms Conlon were discovered in the bedroom of her West Belfast flat off the Suffolk Road last October.\nSharkey – a neighbour at the time – was arrested and subsequently charged with preventing the lawful burial of a corpse on dates between August 2015 and October 2017.\nSharkey, now with an address at Grays Hill in Bangor, pleaded guilty to preventing her lawful burial and to breaking into her home and taking batteries, tools and a coffee mug, and also of stealing both £50 in cash from her, and a First Trust debit card.\nHe also entered guilty pleas to six separate counts of fraud by false representation,  namely using Ms Conlon\u0026#8217s First Trust bank card without authority to buy food totalling £5,988.39 from Domino\u0026#8217s Pizza over a period from October 2015 to 2017.\nHe also bought goods from Sainsbury\u0026#8217s to the value of £3,279.80 from July 2016 to October 2017, and purchased mobile phone credit amounting to £1,030 from March 2016 to October 2017.\nSharkey also admitted using the card to pay Power NI £285, as well payments to the Land and Property Service of £573.83 in September 2016, and £586.20 the following September.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36692914.ece/19ee7/AUTOCROP/w140square/air.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dups ian paisley asked council to pay for 1500 table at dinner council chief embarrassed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But in a dire situation when there are few good options, desperate measures can sometimes be necessary. A referendum may be the least bad option now.\"\n\nMr O\u0027Brien suggested that the most likely outcome of the Brexit negotiations at present was the UK crashing out without a deal.\n\nHe suggested the blame for this almost entirely lied with the British side.\n\nHowever, he admitted: \"The decision by the Irish and EU side last November to demand of the British that they concede the principle that part of their sovereign territory - Northern Ireland - be removed from their customs territory was a major miscalculation. \n\n\"Perhaps it is because Europeans have shared the same customs territory for more than half a century that the signicance of the proposal was under-estimated. But under-estimated it was.\n\n\"Countries do not cede their customs territory to others on demand.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rhi players whose witness statements have just been divulged arlene foster richard bullick conor murphy stephen harron david gordon and ciaran oconnor","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He was subsequently appointed head of public affairs at MCE Public Relations. \n\nHe served as the party\u0027s head of policy from 2002 to 2007 when devolution had been suspended and was a key figure in negotiations which led to the restoration of Stormont.\n\nThe former barrister was appointed special adviser to Peter Robinson in 2008 and also served under Mrs Foster when she took over in January 2016. He was paid a £92,000 salary. Former DUP Spad Dr Andrew Crawford previously told the inquiry that he shared a confidential legal letter with Peter Robinson\u0027s lobbyist son at the request of either the then First Minister or Mr Bullick.\n\nConor Murphy\n\nThe Sinn Fein MLA was first elected to represent Newry and Armagh in 1998.\n\nHe resigned in 2011 but replaced Mickey Brady in 2015 and was re-elected in 2017.\n\nThe former Regional Development Minister has served on numerous committees during his time at Stormont. Crucially he sat on the Enterprise, Trade and Investment committee between 2015 and 2017 as the deputy chairperson.\n\nMr Murphy claims he only became aware of incentive problems following the release of an Audit Office report into RHI in July 2016 but was aware the Deputy First Minister wanted the scheme closed from February of the same year.\n\nStephen Harron\n\nMr Harron worked as a salesman for Hegan Biomass Ltd between 2015 and 2016.\n\nIn this role he met with clients of the Dungannon-based renewable heating firm in addition to clients he had sourced himself.\n\nHis job was to assist them with the purchase and installation of biomass boilers and renewable energy products.\n\nMr Harron purchased two boilers himself in February 2016 and contacted Mrs Foster seeking a delay to the closure of the scheme.\n\nHe says the boilers he installed in commercial units have not been accredited and that he never received payment under the RHI scheme.\n\nDavid Gordon\n\nThe former BBC NI producer turned spin doctor took up a role as NI Executive Press Secretary in October 2016.\n\nHis job was to give \"well informed\" and \"strategic\" media advice to the First Minister, Deputy First Minister and the Executive. In December 2016 he sent an email to Mr Bullick in which he discussed pre-empting a BBC story by dealing with the \"real story\" of why cost controls were delayed in 2015.\n\nHe was tasked with advising the Executive Office and Department for the Economy in relation to RHI and met with a range of high-profile people over the Christmas holidays, including the head of the Civil Service Sir Malcolm McKibbin and Attorney General John Larkin.\n\nCiaran O’Connor\n\nThe fomrer landscape gardener was appointed as a Sinn Fein special adviser in 2015.\n\nHe was one of four special advisers attached to the former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness but also took instructions from Aidan McAteer.\n\nIn February 2016 he told a colleague that he forwarded a memo from Jonathan Bell to his party\u0027s policy advice group  but denies any involvement in or understanding of the RHI scheme.\n\nOriginally from the village of Oranmore in Co Galway, the Ulster University graduate was also Sinn Fein assistant in the European Parliament before being appointed to the role, which came with a £63,736 salary.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"minister byrne couldnt continue if she votes against housing minister","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

said the Government had to act collectively but he has not spoken to Ms Bryne about the vote yet.\n\nThe motion targeting minister Eoghan Murphy has been tabled by Sinn Fein after months of debate about homelessness and a Government response which campaigners believe is inadequate.\n\nMr Varadkar told RTE: “We’re a Government, you know, we’re collective.\n\n“We make decisions together and  a minister doesn’t have confidence in another minister and votes that way, then obviously they couldn’t continue – but like I say she hasn’t had this conversation with me yet.”\n\nMr Murphy said last July he was designating the site of a former council flats complex in Dublin for a pioneering not-for-profit rental scheme.\n\n\n\npic.twitter/Naa8Jzhqox\n\n— Catherine Byrne TD  \nSeptember 24, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMs Byrne, Minister of State at the Department of Health, wrote to Dublin city councillors asking them to oppose the plans.\n\nOn Monday evening she tweeted: “As a lelong resident of Inchicore, I want what is best for my community.\n\n“The former St Michael’s Estate site has a very dficult history and we now have a chance to develop it in a way that will build a sustainable community for the future.”\n\nShe said she wanted to see the vacant site developed.\n\n“However, I do not believe the proposal for a large-scale, high-density apartment development, which would be a major pilot for the cost-rental model in this country, is the right choice for this site.\n\n“It will only serve to put huge pressure on our already fractured community.”\n\nDespite Government promises to build large numbers of new houses, according to Focus Ireland the country does not have a public housing system to meet the needs of the society.\n\nIn the last decade the lack of social housing provision combined with private house building grinding to a halt has meant more people than ever are renting their homes, the anti-homelessness charity and advocacy group added.\n\nIt said almost one in five households lives in a privately rented home, compared with one in 10 a decade ago.\n\n“This has led to enormous pressure on the private rental market which has resulted in constantly rising rent levels and a lack of properties to rent.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36717510.ece/30238/AUTOCROP/w620h342/rabaneStpats20183.jpg","title":"irish to maintain uk rights after brexit but no

a position also supported by the Labour party. \n\nThe Cabinet meeting heard from the committee\u0027s head Prof Alan Manning. \n\n\nIts report\n states it is working off the assumption the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland will continue after Brexit, so \"any future restrictions on EEA migration will not apply to the Irish\". \n\n\"Sometimes we refer to the group of UK and Irish as simply the UK-born to make the report more readable,\" the reports states. \n\nMonday\u0027s Cabinet meeting was told that in the post-Brexit immigration system, EEA and non-EEA nationals \"should be part of one universal system\". \n\nIt is on the basis high-skilled migration is of more economic benefit to the United Kingdom than lower skilled migration. \n\nMinisters also agreed that once free movement is brought to an end, the new system tailored to suit the needs of the UK would boost productivity. \n\nDespite this belief, there are fears restricting the movement of lower-skilled labour could potentially damage the UK economy. \n\n\nThe BBC reports\n a Cabinet source as saying the agreement was not a firm decision, and there would be room for \"light touch migration\" for EU nationals as part of a trade deal with the EU. \n\nThe broadcaster\u0027s political editor Laura Kuenssberg notes that ending freedom of movement has become a \"rhetorical non-negotiable for Theresa May\". \n"},{"url":null,"title":"michael kors renames to capri as it scoops versace for","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Founded in 1978, it has been majority-owned by members of the Versace family since its inception.\n\nAt the time of founder Gianni Versace’s death in 1997, the company had been making plans for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, but it has remained private ever since.\n\nRumours of an IPO or sale resurfaced in the years following the company’s sale of a 20% stake to private equity giant Blackstone in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, former Alexander McQueen boss Mr Akeroyd was named chief executive of Versace to oversee “the next phase of Versace’s development”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"nfl player sends defender flying with indomitable stiff arm in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

That’s my goal.”\n\n\nFind a friend who looks at you the way \n@CamHeyward\n looks at Vance McDonald after this stf arm. \n#PITvsTB\n \npic.twitter/WFuZR7kfqP\n\n— Jeff Eisenband  \nSeptember 25, 2018\n\n\n\n\nWho’d be a defender eh?\n"},{"url":null,"title":"screen time is here and people are shocked by how long they spend on their phone","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

An IVA is a formal insolvency procedure and will have long lasting effects particularly when it comes to obtaining credit in the future. \n\nThere may be other ways of dealing with your debt problems which better suit your situation and your level of borrowing. \n\nIf you feel you are being pushed in the direction of an IVA without any alternative solutions being explored, you should be extremely wary. \n\nAny good debt adviser will take the time to understand your inidual situation and talk you through the ious options which may be open to you before recommending the most appropriate course of action. \n\n\nBe wary of false promises \n\nA common tactic employed by unscrupulous IVA companies is to tell you that they can wipe out a huge percentage of your current debts. \n\nWhile IVAs do often result in you paying back less than you borrowed, the actual amount you have to pay back is based on your inidual circumstances and the level of disposable income you have spare each month. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThis can only be determined following a careful and considered examination of your finances and negotiations with your creditors. \n\nAlthough you may be tempted by these false promises, in reality it is much better to speak to an adviser who will tell you the truth about your situation. This approach will help you understand your options and choose the most appropriate solution for you. \n\n\nDo your research \n\nBefore signing on the dotted line, do your research into the IVA company. \n\nDo they have a physical office presence? \n\nHave you met, or been offered a face to face meeting with an adviser? \n\nAre they registered with the FCA? If you are having dficulty finding this information, have concerns that the company is not being fully honest about who they are, or  you have doubts over their credentials, don’t be afraid to walk away. \n\nAny reputable company will be happy to very who they are and provide details of the regulatory bodies they are part of including their FCA approval. \n\n\nWatch out for up-front fees \n\n\nFees are an unavoidable part of an IVA. \n\nEntering into an IVA will cost you money regardless of who you enter into the arrangement with. \n\nThis is because an insolvency practitioner  will be required to distribute your monthly payment between your creditors during the entire term of the IVA. \n\nHowever, the fees charged can y wildly from provider to provider and so can the manner in which the monthly charges are collected. These fees should already be factored into your agreed monthly payment amount you should not be charged an additional fee on top of this. \n\nIf your IVA provider asks you to pay them a separate amount to cover these costs it is likely you are being charged more for this service than you have to. \n\n\nIf you need proper debt advice, call Begbies Traynor on 028 90 918 200 or email at: \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry sinn fein mla disappointed lack progress new investment bbc ensure equal access gaelic games northern viewers","story":"\nSinn Féin Foyle MLA Raymond McCartney has expressed disappointment at the lack of progress and new investment from the BBC to ensure equal access to gaelic games for northern viewers. \n\nHe was commenting after a Sinn Féin delegation held a meeting with the BBC in Belfast. \n\nRaymond McCartney said: “Sinn Féin met with the BBC on Monday to once again voice our concern at the lack of televised coverage of gaelic games for viewers in the north. \n\n“We are disappointed that BBC have made absolutely no progress or new investment to ensure the quarter of a million gaels in the north have equal access to gaelic games. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“While we welcome the live coverage of the 12 Irish League games, this cannot overshadow the need for more coverage of the GAA which is the largest spectator sport on the island of Ireland. \n\n“Since launching the Fair Play for Ulster Gaels campaign we have heard the frustration felt among GAA fans at what they feel is decades of neglect by BBC in terms of televising and mainstreaming gaelic games.\n\n“We believe that a collaborative approach from sporting organisations and broadcasters is required to end the inequalities surrounding televised coverage and parity of esteem for northern gaels.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"office building derrys riverfront placed market asking price region","story":"\nA prime office building on Strand Road in Derry has come to the market today, with offers expected in the region of £5.25m.\n\nTimber Quay is fully let to a strong tenant line up which includes AXA, Fujitsu, Click Energy, Kainos and Invest NI with a total rent of £644,190 per annum.\n\nThe property is a modern Grade A office space designed for professional companies seeking highly quality office accommodation.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

advisers.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMrs Foster gave a robust defence of the spads on Tuesday during her evidence to the inquiry.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nShe said the DUP is no dferent to other political parties in how they appointed their spads.\n\n“I don’t think we were any dferent at all,  you look at the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP, certainly Sinn Fein put people into posts from their backroom team, we were no dferent,” she told the inquiry.\n\n“I will say this, all of the special advisers that the DUP appointed were people who had third-level education, and who had an ability to work within the system.\n\n“I am not sure that that can be said about every other special adviser.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEarlier Mrs Foster maintained she had not been aware of the scale of the dficulties around the RHI scheme in the autumn of 2015.\n\nShe told the inquiry that had she known, she would have raised it in the Fresh Start political talks during September - October 2015 when they were having discussions with the Treasury.\n\n“If we had known there was such an issue, thinking about this over the last few days, with funding, then that’s something that would have been dealt with in the Fresh Start Talks,” she told the inquiry.\n\nMrs Foster said it would have been much harder in January 2016 to go back to the Treasury to ask for more money for Northern Ireland.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“After the talks were finished, and Treasury were not too happy that here again Northern Ireland had asked for more money after a political negotiation,” she said.\n\n“In January then it was dficult to ask for any space in relation to RHI.\n\n“But  we had known before the Fresh Start Talks had taken place or during the Fresh Start Talks, we certainly would have tried to gain some money from the Treasury at that time, or some leeway.”\n\nQuestions over the Democratic Unionists’ handling of the overspending Renewable Heat Incentive  led to the collapse of political power sharing at Stormont early last year.\n\nThe DUP’s former coalition partners Sinn Fein have refused to retake their seats around the ministerial table and endless rounds of negotiations have not persuaded them.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMrs Foster was enterprise minister when the flawed RHI scheme was being designed.\n\nControls to limit the scheme’s costs were not introduced and overly generous subsidies saw the taxpayer bill spike dramatically.\n\nMrs Foster has contested claims by a successor minister, former party colleague Jonathan Bell, that she asked him to keep the scheme open.\n\nAfter Mr Bell’s allegations were made public Mrs Foster was asked by Sinn Fein to step aside from her role as Stormont’s first minister.\n\nWhen she refused the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned and triggered the collapse of the devolved institutions.\n\nMrs Foster has denied claims there was a party narrative from the DUP to discredit Mr Bell over the RHI scheme.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n

processed through Northern Ireland to avoid the imposition of customs duties.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nUndated handout photo of Federation of Small Businesses in

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

case, should not only have been on the Commonwealth team but should have captained it.\n\n                \nThat is the view of the former head coach of the Sandy Row fighter’s west Belfast boxing club, Michael Hawkins.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Equality Commission said that Lewis had trained at two clubs which would have been perceived as being Protestant, before moving to one in the heart of republican west Belfast.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was there, Holy Trinity Boxing Club, he trained for the Commonwealth squad as part of his failed bid to make the five-man team.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHe was not selected, and believes everyone selected was Catholic.\n\nHe took a court case against the selection body, the Ulster Boxing Council, and has now settled out of court for £8,500 .\n\nHoly Trinity’s head coach Mr Hawkins told the News Letter that not only should Lewis have been on the Commonwealth squad, but that “without a doubt he was the man – he was to captain the team”.\n\nMr Hawkins, in his early 60s, is not convinced that sectarianism lay behind the decision not to pick Lewis and could not be sure what the motivation was.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut whatever the reason, he said Lewis was “wrongly done by, without a doubt”.\n\n“He’s received some money, which doesn’t solve everything,” he said.\n\n“They’ll never repay him for the experience, or for the hurt that’s gone on.”\n\nHe indicated there has been a change of personnel at the Ulster Boxing  Council  since 2015.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWhen it comes to the way it selects boxers from now on, he said: “It should be named the Crocker Criteria. \n\n“Then people will ask: ‘why the Crocker criteria?’ – and let it be told.”\n\nMr Hawkins hails from a nationalist/Catholic background in the west of the city, but stressed sport is what matters and community background does not come into it.\n\nHe added: “The best boxer, the best man, has to go – regardless of who he is or what he is. Lewis’ daddy Ricky said the same thing –  it doesn’t happen again, at least something concrete has come out of it.”\n\nLewis himself said he had chosen Holy Trinity because it was “the best club without a doubt”, and that he “definitely” did not come across sectarianism whilst there.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n

following the death of staff member Lynsey Courtney.\n\n                \nActing Principal Ms Ruth Harkness said the decision had not been taken lightly with a vast number of staff wishing to attend her funeral from the Lurgan and Portadown campuses of the school.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMs Harkness said: “It is with great sadness that I am writing to inform you that a member of staff from Craigavon Senior High School tragically lost her battle with cancer and peacefully passed away on Sunday, September 23, with her family and loved ones by her side.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Ms Lynsey Courtney has been a teaching assistant over the last nine years and also an ex-student of Craigavon Senior High School. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“As a mark of respect towards our colleague we have decided to close the school to students on the afternoon of her funeral, Thursday, September 27 from 12 noon. \n\n“The impact Lynsey had is reflected in the vast number of staff that wish to attend the funeral and show their support for her family and fellow colleagues. Students who wish to attend the funeral may do so wearing full school unorm. It is the responsibility of parent/carer to transport your child to and from the church. \n\n“Please be reassured I have not taken this decision lightly and we have extensively explored all of the logistical and emotional implications, but when everything is taken into consideration the correct decision is to close the school to students from 12 noon. \n\n“Year 11 students involved in LINK will be dismissed from 11.30 am. I also appreciate the possible implications on families in arranging alternative supervision arrangements and sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Looking ahead and as we come to terms with our loss, we will be celebrating and providing opportunities to remember Lynsey’s le and the dference she made to so many.”\n\nLynsey died peacefully surrounded by her loving family in Belfast City Hospital. \n\nLate of Loughgall Road, Portadown. Lynsey, was the devoted mother of Callum, precious daughter of Ron and Sandra, beloved sister of Keith and Gareth, and much loved Auntie of Katie-Lyn.\n\nFuneral service on Thursday at 1.30pm in
