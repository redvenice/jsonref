Theresa May\u0027s \u0027legacy\u0027 plans includes a scheme to increase statutory paternity leave for men to 12 weeksOne notable failure has been the policy of Shared Parental Leave, introduced by former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg in 2015.The policy allows couples to split their maternity and paternity leave more evenly if they wish. The most recent figures suggest that in the 201718 financial year only one in 100 eligible couples took advantage of this opportunity.Employers can claim almost all statutory maternity or paternity pay back from the taxman. The EMW figures were based on claims made to HMRC. EMW lawyer Jon Taylor said: \u0027This trend seems to suggest that the current policy of increasing the usage of paternity leave and having men take up a greater role in childcare is struggling.\u0027The rise of the gig economy has meant that for a lot of men, taking time off for the birth of a child has become an unaffordable luxury. Taking time off unpaid is not an option for a large number of men, especially when the costs of providing for a newborn child are taken into account.\u0027He added: \u0027Shared Parental Leave is a very well-meaning policy, but it has not yet made any significant inroads into the issue of men being unable to take paternity leave. In fact, the gap between men and women taking time off for the birth of a child is actually widening.\u0027Some critics also called for the Government to stop trying to persuade men to bring up babies while mothers work.Author and researcher Patricia Morgan said: \u0027All the evidence says that when a woman has a baby she wants to take time off to look after it. But women are being forced out to work while men are being forced to care for children.\u0027That is not what people choose, and it is time that Governments stopped bullying people and started letting them take their own decisions.\u0027She added: \u0027If paternity leave is available, men should be able to take it at any time while the child is growing up. It might be far more valuable later on rather than just after a baby is born.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Asylum seeker deported Uganda bed man brought UK","story":"Share this article Her claim was rejected in 2013, and she was subsequently deported.Home Office officials told the High Court when they raided her flat for visa violations they found her in bed with a man.Investigators added the woman had not provided any evidence of a same-sex relationship in the UK or Uganda.In a judgement, published by Mr Justice Lewis last week, he ruled the woman was denied the chance to show she had been in a lesbian relationship in Uganda, as reported by The Times.He ruled the fast track appeals system - first introduced by Tony Blair\u0027s government in 2005 - did not give PN sufficient time to get evidence to support her claim. Mr Justice Lewis quashed the decision and ordered the Home Secretary to \u0027use his best endeavours to facilitate the return of PN to the UK.\u0027PN is entitled to claim financial damages from from the government because she was unlawfully detained and deported. Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda and the LGBT community can often face violence and discrimination. Movement for Justice, a human rights group helping to support the woman told The Guardian the Home Office would likely appeal the decision.A Home Office spokesman was not able to confirm when PN would be returning to the UK, or the likely amount of damages. Ugandan lesbian deported deported after sharing bed with man must be brought back | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Ford Fiesta popular vehicle car crooks","story":"Share this article The car is one of the most popular in the UK, with sales of just under 375,000 new and used Fiestas in 2018 alone, making it one of the most common cars on the road.Ford Transit vans were the second most targeted, accounting for 10 per cent of all car thefts, while VW Golfs ranked third, comprising 7 per cent of thefts, the list compiled by online retailer Car Parts 4 Less showed.

Almost two centuries later, the kaiser’s classical aspirations have been fulfilled by British architect David Chipperfield, in the form of a dazzling white temple. Opening this weekend, after 20 years of planning, the James Simon Gallery stands as a €134m (£120m) Parthenon-on-Spree, forming a handsome new entrance to one of the world’s most important repositories of cultural treasures.“We were quite nervous,” says Chipperfield, standing in the lofty new ticketing lobby, where stripes of sunlight flood in between the row of slender white columns outside. “The challenge was how to create something that was of its context and also of our time, in this incredibly sensitive location.”He had good reason to be anxious. His first design, unveiled in 2006, was slammed by German critics as grossly misjudged for the Unesco world heritage site. The jumbled cluster of glass boxes was likened to “a glorified public toilet” by one prominent journalist, in a tirade published under the headline “Not like that, Mr Chipperfield!”The 65-year-old architect is no stranger to Berlin’s culture of fiery public debate. He worked for more than a decade to realise the acclaimed transformation of the Neues Museum, and is now engaged in refurbishing Mies van Der Rohe’s Neue Nationalgalerie, a holy of holies among architects. “It’s refreshing that architecture is subject to such robust debate here,” he says, lamenting what he sees as a lack of serious public discussion around the built environment in the UK. “They really hold your feet to the fire, which is painful at the time, but the work is better for it.”His team went back to the drawing board and took classical cues from the neighbours, taking a lead from the broad entrance staircase of Friedrich Schinkel’s Altes Museum, as well as Friedrich August Stüler’s unifying colonnade, and the weighty stone plinth of the Pergamon Museum next door. These elements have been deftly synthesised into a structure that is entirely its own, a kind of stripped-back, etiolated classicism that is at once imposing and delicate. The result is a strangely scaleless structure that appears monumental from some angles, dinky from others, with its real purpose hidden below ground.Named after one of the most prolific 19th-century Jewish donors to the museums’ collections (a gesture intended to recognise the many other such donors who were erased from history in the Nazi era), the building provides space for the practical functions that didn’t fit in the surrounding museums. It was a lengthy shopping list: ticketing, loos, cloakrooms, shop, cafe, auditorium and gallery for temporary exhibitions, some of which feel a bit squeezed into the narrow site. Chipperfield describes it pragmatically as “a sort of subway station”, serving as a central entrance hub with underground connections to the surrounding buildings. A tunnel now leads to the Neues Museum, and a big portal goes straight to the Pergamon, although the other links are a task for future generations.Anxious that it might be seen as a “dustbin of uses that didn’t fit elsewhere,” the architects have endowed their building with grandiosity in bucketloads: entering this functional underworld is more akin to ascending to a realm of the gods. A broad staircase leads up in three flights to a kind of temple mount, an elevated plateau where ticket desks and a cafe spill out on to a terrace overlooking the Kupfergraben canal. Chipperfield describes it as a “purposefully purposeless space”, a civic deck where people can come and take in the view for free and stroll between the surreally skinny columns – a line of 70 white concrete matchsticks that stand almost nine metres high but less than 30cm thick.Inside, there is a sophistication in the use of materials that Speer could only dream of. A huge wall of translucent white marble, just 6mm thick, casts a pale milky light into the entrance hall, while a perforated copper ceiling shimmers overhead. Steps lead down to a level of cloakrooms and loos, designed as a warm wooden world lined with book-matched walnut veneer – great tree-trunks thinly sliced and opened like the pages of a book, so the grain forms mirrored Rorschach patterns as it wraps around the walls.“We wanted the building’s concrete structure to be exposed, then lined with richly decorated surfaces formed by nature,” says Alexander Schwarz, design director of Chipperfield’s office in Berlin, a violin-maker-turned-architect whose attention to material detail oozes from every corner of the project. The 300-seat auditorium is a mini masterpiece, with concrete walls cast in pleated acoustic folds, and a ceiling that plunges down in three dark wooden waves like draped fabric. Elsewhere, wafer-thin steel benches are upholstered in pale leather, while dark patinated bronze brings a weighty touch to the doors (quite literally – they’re incredibly heavy to open).It all sings with the seductive Chipperfield brand of restrained opulence, but there is a slight sense throughout the building that architectural gesture sometimes overruled practical function. The circulation spaces are expansive, but the new 600 sq metre gallery for temporary shows feels a bit shoehorned into a corner, uncomfortably long and narrow. Meanwhile, a charming staircase leads down to the water along the canal-facing facade, suggesting the romantic Venetian possibility of arrival by boat, but sadly it is nothing of the sort: no boats will be permitted to stop here. “It’s an affectation,” Chipperfield admits. “A human gesture to suggest the building dipping its toe in the water.” With a vocal campaign underway to see this stretch of the waterway transformed into a public swimming area, it could be the perfect place for bathers to pad up the steps to sunbathe on the terrace – a suggestion that makes the museum directors tremble at the thought of people arriving at their sacred cultural citadel in dripping trunks.Which is a shame, because it could do with a touch of Berlin’s more bohemian, freewheeling spirit. It is an elegant and supremely well crafted building, but it feels a bit chilly, parked on the water’s edge like a superyacht.

More generally, TPR’s powers are not restricted by jurisdiction, and we have pursued parties located overseas in the past.”The Arcadia pension scheme, with nearly 10,000 members, is running an estimated deficit of between £537m and £727m, the committee said. Arcadia owns Topshop, Topman, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Evans.Field said: “Finally we see the famous Green chequebook produced, by Lady Green, to make good on at least some of the current promise to Arcadia’s pension scheme. Following the committee’s intervention, this is the first time TPR has confirmed it could pursue the Greens’ assets overseas to make good on the CVA promises.“But that still leaves a worrying amount tied to Arcadia’s fortunes. It is for Sir Philip Green to prove he can make a success of Arcadia, but to prove his commitment to Arcadia’s staff and pensioners, he could promise now also to stump up the rest from his family coffers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0c9e3fe0babff027db8bcb958b28112c260d3cc/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=295b4c56012b084677301f9ab815ca53","title":"the next era of human progress what lies behind the global new cities epidemic","story":"The urge to build cities from scratch is not new – but this time they are being conceived by private multinational corporations as gilt-edged tax-exempt gated communitiesAt 8.30 every morning, an announcement is piped though a speaker in the ceiling of Kim Jong-won’s apartment, barking the daily bulletin in a high-pitched voice. The disembodied broadcaster details new parking measures, issues with the pneumatic waste disposal chute and various building maintenance jobs to be carried out that day.“There’s no way of turning it off,” sighs Kim’s wife, Jung-sim, as she prepares breakfast. “I hate technology but my husband is an early adopter. He has to have everything first.”It was Kim’s love of the latest tech that prompted him move his family to the future, or the nearest thing to it – Songdo, South Korea’s self-styled “smart city”, built on a 600-hectare parcel of artificial land dredged from the Yellow Sea near Seoul’s Incheon airport. It is a place where the garbage is automatically sucked away through underground pipes, where lampposts are always watching you, and where your apartment block knows to send the elevator down to greet you when it detects the arrival of your car. Sensors in every street track traffic flow and send alerts to your phone when it’s going to snow, while you can monitor the children’s playground on TV from the comfort of your sofa.The feature Kim enjoys most is a small touchscreen display on his kitchen wall that charts allows him to keep track of his and his wife’s consumption of electricity, water and gas and, most important, compare it against the average statistics for the building. Flicking between the screens of bar charts and graphs, a broad grin spreads across his face: for yet another day running, they are more energy-efficient than all their neighbours.From their living room window at the top of one of the city’s new residential towers, a panorama of downtown Songdo unfolds. Across an eight-lane highway lies Central Park, a broad swath of trees surrounding an ornamental lake, flanked by rows of glass towers with vaguely jaunty silhouettes. Armies of identikit concrete apartment blocks march into the hazy distance beyond, terminating at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course. It looks a lot like many other modern Asian cities, a place of generic towers rising above a car-dominated grid. Public life is mostly confined to the air-conditioned environments of malls and private leisure clubs.Initiated by the South Korean government in the late 1990s, when Incheon airport was being planned, Songdo represents a model that has been replicated numerous times around the world. Begun as a joint venture with US developer Gale International – which has since hawked its “city in a box” kit to other countries – the Songdo International Business District was conceived as a $40bn hub for international companies, an exemplar of sustainable urbanism and testing ground for new smart city technologies.Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping. New research has identified more than 100 examples, nearly all in Asia and Africa.\u0026nbspThis week  Cities meets the 90-year-olds who built the Bulgarian city of Dimitrovgrad after the second world war (many still live there) and visits the bizarre Bahria Town development promising Karachi residents protection from terror attacks and violent crime.\u0026nbsp We look at Hong Kong’s plan to build artificial islands for 1.1 million people and examine Egypt’s dream to conquer the Sahara. We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?It claims to have the highest concentration of green Leed-certified buildings in the world, yet it is still entirely car-based, with not even a train line to the nearby airport. To get to Seoul, just 30km away, takes an hour and a half by metro. Songdo may have an “Integrated Operations Centre” – a Big Brother control room where reams of data are funnelled in real time from thousands of sensors across the city – but the physical urban model is no different to any other car-riddled business district. For all its low-energy labels, it is an expensive, exclusive and impersonal place.Across the world, there are countless new cities like Songdo in the making. Barely differentiable, and often designed and serviced by the same international consultancies, these hi-tech urban enclaves are cropping up from Kenya to Kazakhstan . India has pledged to build 100 smart cities, while Africa is seeing $100bn pumped into at least 20 projects. China, having initiated 500 of its own smart city pilots, is now summoning a string of outposts through its Belt and Road initiative, from the dry port of Khorgos, on its border with Kazakhstan, to east London’s Royal Albert Dock, reborn as the Asian Business Park.Saudi Arabia has pledged to trump them all with Neom, a $500bn mega-project billed as an answer to Silicon Valley. Planned as a centre for renewable energy, biotechnology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, it sprawls across an area 33 times the size of New York City. It claims to be nothing less than “the world’s most ambitious project” an incubator for “the next era of human progress”.The escapist urge to build cities from scratch is nothing new. At the turn of the 19th century, the Garden City movement saw a generation of bucolic communities planned in reaction to the grime and overcrowding of rapidly industrialising cities, driven by a powerful campaign for social reform. Half a century later, the New Town movement developed these ideas, promising a brave new world of modern, self-sufficient municipalities rising from the ruins of the second world war, and focused on building an inclusive, democratic society.Now, in the first decades of a new millennium, a surge in global population growth and a sense of impending environmental armageddon have spurred an epidemic of planned cities of a very different kind. This time they are being conceived by private multinational corporations as gilt-edged gated communities and tax-exempt free-trade hubs, each branded as the ultimate techno-eco-utopia.According to research from Savills, real estate is now a more valuable asset class than all stocks, shares and securitised debt combined, with a total value of around $228tn. That represents three and a half times global GDP, or 40 times the value of all the gold ever mined. While once we dug down to extract value from the earth, the bristling glass towers of these new urban enclaves are the inverted mineshafts of today – complete with equally damaging side effects.This new breed of city takes various different forms, from government initiatives, to public-private partnerships, to entirely private enterprises. Many are being used to jump-start economies in the developing world, with masterplans carefully calibrated to attract foreign investors and treasuries looking to sink their funds into something concrete. They provide a powerful means for wealthy countries to expand their strategic influence abroad, with the construction of new cities acting as a form of “debt-trap diplomacy”, tying host nations into impossibly burdensome deals. They are billed as a panacea for the world’s urban ills, solving overcrowding, congestion and pollution yet, more often than not, they turn out to be catalysts for land dispossession, environmental degradation and social inequality.At the southern tip of Malaysia on a series of four artificial islands, one such promised Elysium is sprouting from the sand. Launched in 2014, Forest City is a $100bn joint venture between the Chinese developer Country Garden and the Sultan of Johor. It is planned to house 700,000 people by 2050.Forest City has been marketed as an “iconic urban area” moments from Singapore, a “new Shenzhen” where the “concepts of safety, convenience, green and smart are integrated into every corner of life”. It features luxury apartment towers, hotels, offices, shopping malls and an international school, all smothered with a lush blanket of greenery and surrounded by a “virtual electric fence”.The apartments are prohibitively expensive for most Malaysians but a relative bargain for Chinese investors, who have been flown here in droves and bussed to the spaceship-shaped sales gallery to marvel at the enormous model of the Avatar-like world that awaits. Cashiers stand at the end of the guided tour to take credit card down-payments before the tourists get back on the bus.This self-styled “eco-city” is being built on 162m cubic metres of shipped-in sand that has already had a damaging impact on the surrounding marine environment. The causeway built to facilitate the land reclamation for the islands cuts right across the Tanjung Kupang seagrass meadows, a precious habitat that helps to stabilise the sea floor and protect coastal erosion, while mangroves have been trampled to make way for the development’s prefabrication factories.Reclamation began without the required environmental impact assessment, and the effects have already been felt by local fishermen, who complain of reduced catches due to the destruction of their fragile ecosystem. The emerging island community, meanwhile, is not so much a city as a ghostly duty-free resort, a haunted Photoshop montage mostly bereft of full-time residents.A similar story is taking place thousands of miles away on the west coast of Africa, where “an investment opportunity on an unprecedented scale” is being touted on a patch of sand dredged from the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Lagos. Eko Atlantic is another public-private partnership, this time brokered between the state government and the Chagoury Group, an influential Nigerian business empire, with engineering expertise provided by the China Communications Construction Company – a state-owned conglomerate that appears to have cornered the market in conjuring land from the ocean, being responsible for dredging Forest City as well as terraforming disputed islands in the South China Sea.Eko Atlantic is protected by its own sea defence barrier made of 100,000 five-tonne concrete blocks, dubbed the “Great Wall of Lagos”, making it a secure private island for the few, shielded from climate catastrophe at the expense of others. It is a raised atoll for the wealthy Nigerian elite, while the poor remain consigned to low-lying coastal slums whose exposure to deadly flooding and coastal erosion has only increased since the construction of the sea wall.As the environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey put it, the project “is contrary to anything one would want to do if one took seriously climate change and resource depletion”. As if to cement Donald Trump’s image as the poster boy for climate denial, the US embassy recently announced it will be relocating to a secure five-hectare compound there.The glamorous computer-generated visions of Lagos’s exclusive new appendage have sparked a thirst for similarly futuristic and climate-inappropriate schemes across the continent, as countries race to provide the answer to housing the additional 1.3 billion people that are projected to be added to Africa’s population by 2050. Ghana unveiled plans for the Hope City – Hope is an acronym of Home, Office, People and Environment – a $10bn fantasy that would be home to Africa’s tallest building.It has been joined by Tanzania’s Kigamboni New City in Dar es Salaam, Kenya’s Tatu City in Nairobi, Rwanda’s Vision City in Kigali, and Senegal’s plans for the $2bn Diamniadio Lake City (designed by the appropriately named Bad Consultant) – all of which follow the cookie-cutter approach of car-based, hi-tech hubs, rarely planned with existing populations in mind.As Rachel Keeton and Michelle Provoost of the International New Town Institute say in their new book, To Build a City in Africa: “New Towns are becoming islands with high quality services, while many existing African cities continue to suffer from unreliable electricity provision, limited access to clean water, and other ineffectual municipal services. Because of limited access to mortgages and other home financing models, the real African middle class cannot afford to live in these New Towns.”Despite the evidence of half-built utopias lying mostly empty around the world, the seductive dream of building new cities from scratch shows no sign of abating any time soon. City-making, and the innumerable planning, engineering and technical services that go with it, is a booming industry, and corporations are intent on recycling their ideas irrespective of local context.Back in Songdo – whose developers proudly list the exotic destinations where their ideas have since been rolled out – an innovation centre showcases the latest in parking violation sensors and crime-fighting lampposts, all branded with the u-City logo. Why “u”, I ask? “It stands for ubiquitous,” says the company rep. “Ultimately, we want our kind of city to be everywhere.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9986eab56ece26925b9814886057a3a4e3aa15cc/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4c509154d73c73a6ce74fa54af8dd1","title":"cori gauff teenagers tennis greta thunberg","story":"Whether it’s the tennis star, Greta Thunberg or Alex from Glastonbury, teens are having a moment, and deservedly soAt Wimbledon, 15-year-old Cori Gauff, in her first grand slam match, dismisses her role model, Venus Williams. Then she pulls off an astonishing comeback against Polona Hercog. Another 15-year-old, Alex Mann, wows Glastonbury with his star turn, plucked from the crowds by rapper Dave. And, of course, Greta Thunberg, still just 16, continues in her astonishing quest to push the climate crisis to the top of all our agendas, this week squaring up to Opec chiefs, who branded her campaign the “greatest threat” to the oil industry. Teens are definitely having a moment.So why is it that, prodigies aside, when we think of teenagers, what often comes to mind is an angst-ridden generation of “snowflakes”, unable to cope with the mildest criticism? They are stereotyped as obsessed with celebrity, shopping and self-promotion. Or our minds conjure up gang violence: the most menacing, destructive form of youthful bonding.One of the report’s authors, Laura Partridge, says: “We really do underestimate teenagers and young people and, when we speak to them, there are so many doing great things so many have a culture of giving back.”She suggests that such unfair, negative stereotyping can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. “This … could seriously undermine teenagers’ confidence about their ability to make a positive change in the world.”I have spent the past two years interviewing teenagers from many different countries for my book. Honestly, it has been a joy. They are proof that you don’t need to know one end of a tennis racket from the other to be extraordinary. They are everyday heroes: volunteers, social entrepreneurs, fundraisers, campaigners or simply young people making the right choices in difficult circumstances. They explain how they have improved their own lives and others’: from dealing with bullying at school, to upcycling clothes for the homeless and preserving Britain’s beaches. Cameron Osburn, who was 17 years old when I spoke to him, was left on the subs bench at football because cerebral palsy meant he couldn’t run as fast as other players, so founded his own football team for children with disabilities, Adversity United. Will Kilgannon, who was just 15, lost his father to prostate cancer, and has campaigned tirelessly to increase awareness of the condition.I also spoke to Amika George, then 19, at the forefront of the campaign against period poverty, and Maya Ghazal, also 19, a refugee from Syria who is now an advocate for refugee rights, while studying to become an aviation engineer. There’s Zainab Gulbano, 17, who thought she’d always be the class clown but now puts her energy into helping rebellious kids as a youth worker at her old school and Amarni, 17, who stepped away from the fringes of gang violence and now inspires a group of other teens to focus on their love of music.They may not be on the stage at Glastonbury but they are the young people on our streets, on the bus, shuffling to school in their parkas or hoiked-up skirts, and they should make us proud.It became clear to me during these conversations that, very often, it is the right kind of support from someone who believes in them that can propel a teenager to do the right thing. We adults, whether parents, grandparents, carers or teaching staff, can fall into the trap of being too judgmental, forgetting that it’s their “job” to disagree with us and make our lives difficult, all part of the process of separating and growing up. Of course, as a parent I’ve been judgmental myself. We believe that we always have the answers our young people seek but sometimes other young people can be the influence and inspiration they need. Adults tend to see this kind of peer influence as a bad thing, but it can be transformational if the ones they look up to are achieving something positive in the world.Their age means that teenagers are hopefully not yet world-weary or jaded by constant rejection. If they have had a vision for the change they want to see in their own lives, the community around them and the wider world, they are well placed to articulate it. We should listen.Lucy Gavaghan, who at 14 persuaded Tesco and other major supermarket chains to pledge not to sell eggs from caged hens, put it like this: “There must be something about being a teenager that makes me feel that this is a great point to look around and think, ‘Is this the kind of world I want to grow up in?’ I think my age helped me. Everything seems so clear to me.”• Margaret Rooke is the author of You Can Change the World!

Which got me thinking: it was no stretch at all to imagine these two talented politicians as prime minister and chancellor, discussing the forthcoming comprehensive spending review.This prompted a further thought: how easy it would be to construct a pretty decent cabinet from Labour’s backbenches: Jess Phillips, Seema Malhotra, Owen Smith, Stephen Kinnock, Gloria De Piero, Angela Eagle and David Lammy for a start. Then add in a handful of existing frontbenchers – Tom Watson, Keir Starmer – and, before you knew it, you’d have the basis of an electable Labour government with a fighting chance of uniting the country and governing it competently.At which point, Barry Gardiner walked over to greet a colleague – and my private game of Fantasy Government was terminated abruptly by this bleak reminder of what Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet (with a few honourable exceptions) is actually like.It was a tiny parable, indicative of a gigantic political problem. In my adult life – and I include 1997 – the nation has never been so obviously screaming for a sensible Labour government.The Conservative party is exhausted, delirious, badly in need of an Uber off to the quieter pastures of opposition, where it can have a nice little sleep. But it is a huge mistake to imagine that this Uber will arrive of its own accord. The deepest Conservative instinct is to cling on to power, and the only force that can break its grip is Labour.When that election comes, both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats will have new leaders. Corbyn will be old news. What, four years into his leadership, will be the source of his momentum, his drive, his implacable claim to office?Populism is volatile stuff: it is the political branch of pop culture, and, as such, mostly ephemeral. Who now remembers Corbyn’s star performance at Glastonbury in 2017? Like most hits, it had its moment, blazed across the sky and was then forgotten.Since then, the Labour leader has failed abjectly to handle the antisemitism row in a manner befitting a future prime minister. The lack of urgency with which he has managed this internal party crisis has been morally contemptible – as is the refrain that every news report on this subject is axiomatically a “smear”.If Corbyn cannot deal speedily with the people in his party’s ranks who hate Jews, what are the odds that he will be able to manage the nation’s education system, or the NHS, or its defence?On Brexit, we cruise towards a no-deal departure on 31 October. In such desperate circumstances, you do not have to be a remainer to conclude that the public should be consulted again in a fresh referendum. Such an offer, made unambiguously and without qualification by Labour, would electrify the political landscape. Like all such decisions, it would bear an element of risk. But that is the essence of statesmanship.Whether he likes it or not, this is the great opportunity of Corbyn’s leadership: one he did not seek, but with which he is confronted nonetheless. The goal is two miles wide. The goalkeeper lies unconscious on the pitch. The ball is two inches away from the line. And – thus far – Corbyn’s instinct has been to nudge the ball feebly to the left, promising only to consult his members and the unions on the extent to which goal-scoring is consistent with authentic socialism.All such arguments are routinely dismissed as Blairite rubbish, the bletherings of the “metropolitan elite”, the voice of those who have “learned nothing”. In response to which I think: oh well, go ahead and lose if you like.But then I wonder if the clique that has the Labour party in its grip would be the true losers of an election defeat. The people that really suffer when Labour fails are the people it was established to protect: those who need the living wage whose level Boris Johnson does not even know those who have paid the price for the failures of universal credit those who need alleviation of the immigration “hostile environment” a government prepared to tax wealth to subsidise the 21st-century NHS and social care.At this level of politics, in times like these, feeling righteous is not enough. In fact, in the greater scheme of things, it isn’t anything at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dde298d60791dd8f36528e8d2b96efd2c99a0f52/0_198_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=817fd7c325faa2b0170136b49ac350a8","title":"troubling overlap between jared kushner business interests and us foreign policy","story":"A congressional inquiry has raised the possibility that Kushner supported a blockade of a US ally as payback because it would not fund his family’s businessIn May 2017, two of Donald Trump’s senior advisers, Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon, met for a private dinner with top leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The pair learned of a plan by the two American allies to impose a blockade on another US ally, Qatar, according to congressional staffers.Trump’s secretary of state at the time, Rex Tillerson, was left in the dark. Tillerson only learned of the meeting two months ago, when he was interviewed for seven hours in a closed-door session with lawyers and staffers working for the House foreign affairs committee.Tillerson’s testimony, which was made public last week, highlighted the inner workings of the Trump administration and revealed the extent to which Kushner – and to a lesser degree, Bannon, who left the administration in August 2017 – were conducting a shadow foreign policy. When asked how he felt about being left out of such vital meetings as America’s top diplomat, Tillerson told the committee: “It makes me angry … I didn’t have a say. The state department’s views were never expressed.”The meeting in May 2017 was crucial because it helped solidify a Trump foreign policy favoring Saudi Arabia and the UAE in their conflict with Qatar, a tiny emirate in the Gulf that is rich in natural gas and home to a major US military base. It also raises questions about a problem that has dogged Kushner since the earliest days of the Trump administration: whether his family’s business interests are driving his political decisions.Weeks before the blockade, Kushner’s father – the real estate developer Charles Kushner – met with a top Qatari official to seek financing for a distressed Manhattan office tower. The Qataris declined. One must wonder: did Jared Kushner support a blockade of a US ally as political payback because it would not fund his family’s business?In his role as the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Kushner has cultivated a close relationship between Trump and the ruthless Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump has tried to shield the prince from blame for the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, despite a CIA assessment that concluded, with “high confidence”, that the prince had ordered the killing. Trump and Kushner have offered Saudi Arabia unwavering support for continued weapons sales and business deals with the kingdom.In February 2018, the Washington Post reported that US intelligence services were worried that officials in at least four countries – the UAE, Israel, Mexico and China – had discussed ways to manipulate Kushner. The paper quoted US officials saying that Kushner was “naïve and being tricked” in his contacts with foreign leaders, who tried to take advantage of his complex business arrangements and lack of foreign policy experience. That month, Kushner’s interim security clearance was downgraded from top secret to secret, which restricted his access to the most sensitive US government information. In May 2018, however, Trump ordered his chief of staff to give Kushner a permanent top-secret clearance, over the objections of US intelligence officials concerned about his contacts with foreign leaders and his business dealings.The Kushner family’s financial troubles began after it purchased an office tower at 666 Fifth Avenue for a record $1.8bn in 2007, at the height of a real estate market that crashed a year later. Since 2016, Kushner Companies had negotiated with investors from China and Qatar to bail out the property, which was facing $1.4bn in loan payments due in February 2019. But those deals fell through because the investors, who had connections to the Chinese and Qatari governments, worried about the public scrutiny created by Kushner’s job in the White House.Kushner insists he has played no role in negotiations over the Fifth Avenue tower. After he joined the Trump administration as a senior adviser in January 2017, Kushner resigned as the chief executive of his family’s company. He sold his stake in the Fifth Avenue building and some other assets to a family trust. But Kushner kept a substantial stake in his family’s firm, and he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, own real estate and other holdings worth more than $800m, according to disclosure forms.The Kushner family focused on Qatar as a potential savior for its investment even before Trump’s election. In 2015 and 2016, according to the Intercept, Jared Kushner and his father Charles negotiated with the Qatari billionaire and investor Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who had served as Qatar’s prime minister. The businessman offered a deal worth about $500m, but it was contingent on Kushner Companies securing investments from other creditors. The deal fell through when the Kushners were unable to secure other funding.Then, in April 2017, the Intercept reports, Charles Kushner and other officials in the family real estate firm met with the Qatari finance minister, seeking an investment from Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund to bail out the troubled Fifth Avenue property. The Qataris declined.That meeting in late April 2017, just weeks before the crisis erupted between Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, is pivotal because it was the first time that the Kushners had directly approached a representative of the Qatari government. Democratic congressional staffers zeroed in on that meeting and subsequent events in their questioning of Tillerson. And while the former top diplomat demurred in answering directly, the line of questioning revealed that House investigators are exploring the sequence of events involving Kushner’s family company and the blockade of Qatar.“Were you concerned, sir, that Mr Kushner’s family was seeking significant funding from Qatar at the same time as he was involved in decisions of this magnitude that involved Qatar?” one staffer asked Tillerson.Tillerson responded: “Your question assumes that I was aware that he was involved in decisions around Qatar. I’m unaware of that.”The Democratic congressional staffers told Tillerson that they learned about the dinner on 20 May 2017 in which Kushner, Bannon and Saudi and UAE leaders discussed plans for the blockade of Qatar. The two Trump advisers were in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, as a part of a large US delegation accompanying Trump, after he decided to make the kingdom his first stop on his maiden foreign trip as president. Kushner and Prince Mohammed played key roles in organizing that two-day trip, where Saudi rulers feted Trump with multiple banquets and displays of admiration.Two weeks later, in the early hours of 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia and three of its allies – the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain – severed diplomatic and economic relations with Qatar. Saudi leaders accused Qatar of financing terrorism supporting Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas and undermining Arab efforts to isolate Iran. They imposed a blockade, sealing off Qatar’s only land border, and restricting air and sea travel to and from the peninsula.Initially, Trump sided with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in their campaign to isolate Qatar. With a series of tweets criticizing Qatar, he undermined efforts by two of his top national security aides, Tillerson and the then defense secretary, Jim Mattis, to defuse the crisis.

My eldest is nine, I should mention. I’d be very impressed if she wanted to at this point. But when the time comes, absolutely.”Research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research earlier this year found that workers with higher vocational qualifications in Stem subjects earned £5,000 more than graduates from most British universities by the age of 30, while in construction, social sciences and business their average earnings were close to those of many graduates.The HTQ status will be given to what are known as level four and five qualifications, which sit between A-levels at level three and bachelor degrees at level six, and are offered by further education colleges, universities and the proposed institutes of technology.The government hopes to have NTQ status established by 2022, in time for the first cohort of school-leavers gaining T-levels, the vocational complement to A-levels that are to be taught from next year.But Hinds said that further development was waiting on the outcome of this year’s spending review, and in particular the government’s response to the report on post-age 18 education in England conduced by Philip Augar.Augar’s review called for a substantial injection of resources into further education and training, coupled with cuts to university income from tuition fees.Mark Dawe, the chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers, said he was sceptical of the benefits of the qualification revamp without further support.“Until some action is taken along the lines of the Augar recommendations, many young people are going to be sucked on to university courses that don’t offer them the opportunities they deserve,” Dawe said.“We can create a whole suite of qualifications and it won’t make a blind bit of difference. We have seen the incredible growth of higher level apprenticeships and that is because both young people and employers see the real benefits of working while training and applying the learning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a65ab1aecb4921457f3db7f7fad29dc0f2d73dd/209_531_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa11d7e78ea045b82e7291ea4af1b48b","title":"share photos of wildflower and planted meadows and verges near you","story":"If you have seen any planted meadows or verges by roads or public spaces, we would like to hear from youBritish conservation charity Plantlife’s campaign to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges has seen some councils take the message seriously.Posting on Twitter, Bex Langley wrote about the eight miles of flowers planted along a major road in Rotherham thanks to the local council.The group’s road verge campaign started in 2013 in response to the mowing down of wildflowers – flowers which are not intentionally seeded or planted.

The loss of life expectancy is worse in Birmingham than some other major cities in the UK including Manchester, researchers found.Birmingham is one of five cities required by the government to set up a clean air zone to reduce toxic air, as part of plans to tackle the illegal levels of pollution in 38 out of 43 areas of the country.But in Birmingham and Leeds the start date of January next year has been postponed because of government delays in providing vehicle-checking software.On Monday research commissioned by UK100 – a network of local leaders across the country – for the first time examines the burden air pollution places on mortality in major cities.The report, carried out by Kings College London, said the health cost of the city’s toxic air was £470m every year.The study examined NO2 and PM2.5, two of the leading causes of poor health from air pollution, in the city’s 10 constituencies. It found that air pollution had the greatest impact in the most deprived areas, and that men are more likely to be affected than women. In Erdington, up to 91 deaths are attributable annually to air pollution, compared with up to 59 in Edgbaston and 57 in Hall Green.Waseem Zaffar, cabinet member for transport and environment on the city council, said the results were shocking.“They demonstrate the sheer scale of the major public health crisis we are dealing with in Birmingham today,” he said.“One life cut short by poor air quality is one too many, so this is exactly why the city is taking forward measures such as the clean air zone and why we continue to work with other cities across the country to tackle this problem together, but we also need strong leadership on this issue at a national government level.”Sue Huyton, coordinator of the Clean Air Parent’s network, said action was needed now.“It’s awful that children living in the UK are breathing air that may shorten their lives. As a parent, you want to do everything you can for your children, but when it comes to air pollution you can feel helpless – that’s why those in power must step up.“We need the government and Birmingham city council to take ambitious action to tackle the toxic air in this city, and we need them to do it now.”Air pollution has been identified by Public Health England as the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK. Evidence shows that it can cause or worsen a range of lung and heart conditions including asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic heart disease and stroke. Research suggests air pollution caused by NO2 and PM2.5 could cause 36,000 deaths per year.Polly Billington, director of UK100, said the report should be a wake-up call to policy makers.“We need to tackle this invisible killer which is cutting the lives of children and causing health misery for thousands of adults. By working together, local councils and central government can put in place ambitious and inclusive clean air zones to tackle the most polluting sources of dirty air and let us breathe freely.”The government has been forced by the courts to improve its plans to clean up the air, after losing legal action taken by environmental lawyers Client Earth.A government spokesperson said: “We are aware of concerns over delays and are carrying out work to develop key components of the system to support the Charging Clean Air Zones for January 2020.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9c0f6d43973fe95132e51515845d4502a0d3d2e/0_12_3123_1873/master/3123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=734b976707ba58afe6bd916c5ba96fcf","title":"stella mccartney its not like i am here for an easy life","story":"The fashion designer talks about her latest collection, the creative frustrations of eco sequins – and why she’s not a fan of washing her braAlongside the luxury clothing, there is also special clean air piped into every room to combat the pollution of central London, a ballpit for rich children to play in (at least, I don’t think any other kind come in here) and a three-hour jamming session of original Paul McCartney music playing on repeat, as Stella explains when I meet her in a private room on the top floor. Limited-edition versions of her clothes hang all around us, saved for favoured customers who make it into this locked zone.Indeed, it turns out that the rocks have been shipped down from Paul’s farm on the Mull of Kintyre, where mist rolls in from the sea – the mist now rolls into his daughter’s garments, apparently. “I was like, Dad, this is weird…” she explains, “but can I have some rocks?”Stella is bright-eyed and perky, quite frank, open and has the manner of someone not put on this earth to waste time. I ask if we are in a VIP room, but she groans and says that when somebody called it that during the planning stages she responded that they would not be working with her for very long if they used that word again. I think it is politically important to Stella to be seen as egalitarian, which must be hard when you’re selling fluffy jumpers for a grand.Anyway, the award-winning designer, 47, is dressed in layers of matching beige neutrals today, of her own design, of course. We are here to discuss a new collection she has created, called All Together Now, which is inspired by the 1968 Yellow Submarine film based on music by her father and his fellow Beatles. She has always been a proud bearer of her mother Linda’s vegetarian credentials, going to great lengths to avoid any use of leather and fur. But ing right into the Beatles legacy is something new.But first we need to talk about the shop itself, of which Stella is equally proud. She was really specific about the rocks, she says, after her dad agreed to liberate them. “We had to reinforce the floors, to weight-bear them and all that sort of stuff, for my rock passion. And then, you know, they weren’t quite the right colour, so now we spray them.” Stella also wanted moss on them, but the problem with keeping that going, as she explains, sadly, “is that moss doesn’t really want to live on Bond Street. In a store.”“Oh yes the Moss is here, in many ways,” the McCartney agrees. When I put it to her that her friend is now a national treasure, she says Moss would never accept such a role, “because you probably wouldn’t like her so much if she did. You’d be like, ‘Oh, bummer, she’s not as cool as we thought she was.’ But I’ll tell her,” says Stella, clearly proud of her friendship. “I’ll say, Sophie says you’re amazing.” We both know she will do no such thing, but still.The new Beatles-inspired range includes knitwear with ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE embroidered on it in various languages and Savile Row tailored jackets inspired by the marching-band suits in the film. There is a long, psychedelic Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds dress, and plenty of yellow submarine motifs throughout the collection, which is for women, men and children. “Look at that fucking Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band bag for kids, how cool is that?” she says as she shows me her inventions. The idea came to her after the film was remastered last year and her dad held a family screening. “Just a little one, but it was literally like all of the Beatles’ children and grandchildren there.” Influenced by the kids’ enjoyment of the film, she says she saw it through completely fresh eyes. “It just hit me really hard. I went far too deep into all the meanings. Even the line ‘All together now’ – I thought, that is so incredible that these four kids from Liverpool, at such a young age, came up with something so inclusive, which feels very contemporary to everything that we’re talking about today, in the now. I came away feeling really inspired, like I had to do something with it.”I tell her that I recently showed it to my fascinated seven-year-old and it reawakened childhood memories of having my mind blown at a similar age, as if you could almost get drunk on the psychedelic imagery.“I agree completely. It’s a gift. All hand-drawn with inidual gels and, you know, who today in the world of music is going to create an animated film like that? Who on earth has created a body of work like that? I can’t name anyone.”McCartney lives in west London (as well as in the countryside, where she rides horses) and is married to Alasdhair Willis, with whom she has four children. Her unwavering moral commitments have put her in an interesting position as an activist in the fashion business, which she describes as the second most harmful industry to the planet. “It’s my intention to stand shoulder to shoulder with the conventional houses and show that you can actually be respectful in your supply chain and manufacture.”To which end, she’s created alternatives not just to leather and fur, but also to all sorts of other materials, such as PVC, because its chemical production is so harmful, “and they say it’s cancerous to the people who work with it, and then the residue runs into the rivers because the factories are built on rivers”. It has taken her 10 years of innovation to make a clear shoe without using it.Is it satisfying to have to work hard on the invention side of things? “No. It’s not like I go, ‘Oh, I’m not going to use PVC because the challenge will make me more creative.’ It’s like, ‘Well, that fucking sucks, and I’ve also only got three sequins that I can use in two colourways as opposed to 5,000 that everyone else will use.’ If everyone else was sustainable, we could have a level playing field, so it does feel unfair – but it’s my choice and I believe very much in my reasons for working in that way. You know what? It’s not like I’m here for an easy life.”She says recent changes in the industry, with other designers waking up to the planet, are led by people power. “These recent changes are consumer-driven. I don’t think our industry would be doing that if the customers weren’t demanding it.”So it’s simply a capitalist response to the market? “I think so, yeah, and that’s OK, because that’s capitalism, you know, that’s what happens. But now is the time, as a consumer, to really understand. We’re going to have to push the people in power. And how fucking amazing is it that it’s 15, 16-year-olds who are doing that? Thank God for them.”Does this mean that her two daughters and two sons, who are aged between eight and 14, will take over the business one day? “I don’t know. Of course one side of me is like, ‘I want the kids to do this.’ But then it’s like, is that my ego? I don’t want to put that pressure on them. My mum and dad didn’t go, ‘Right, you’re going to be writing all the next albums.’ The kids should just do what they want to do.” Indeed, she recently watched Succession, a TV drama about a media dynasty that battles over who will inherit the family business, and “found it a bit depressing, actually”.Fashion means everything to her, though. She even wants to analyse my outfit. “Psychologically,” she says, “I find it incredibly interesting that you chose a vintage-esque, ethnic, quilted cotton coat to wear today. It’s a very feminine piece, probably women made it. It says you probably celebrate some kind of hand touch, heritage, some kind of travel.” The gold cuffs on my shirt, “also tells a lot about you, that little bit of Lurex peeping out”.She’s not so keen on my leather boots, oops, (“People don’t bring leather into me, generally…”) but, tragically, it’s my face that says most about me, which will teach me not to make such an effort next time.“And then you’ve got your red lip and… you know, you’ve got a lot of makeup on,” Stella McCartney notes, staring at my head. A pettier person than I might respond that she is wearing exactly as much makeup herself, only it’s all in neutral shades just like her outfit – but I’m not, so I won’t.The publicist tells me there is time for me to ask one last question, so I use my precious minute to ask what she thinks of dry cleaning. Do we actually need it in the world today? Stella bursts out laughing, almost barking with amusement that I would use my precious last moments on this topic.“I love you,” she says, “this is such a great, random question. OK, so I went to St Martins when I was a baby and in my free time I studied on Savile Row to be a bespoke tailor. It was a very masculine world, incredible, obsessed.”Were you the only girl in the room? “I was the only girl who had ever been in the room. I was there for three years and I barely learned how to set a sleeve head in a sleeve. It’s like architecture. It’s amazing. And the rule on a bespoke suit is you do not clean it. You do not touch it. You let the dirt dry and you brush it off. Basically, in life, rule of thumb: if you don’t absolutely have to clean anything, don’t clean it. I wouldn’t change my bra every day and I don’t just chuck stuff into a washing machine because it’s been worn. I am incredibly hygienic myself, but I’m not a fan of dry cleaning or any cleaning, really.”And then her assistant whisks me away, urged by Stella to show me around even more of the shop, because building it “killed me. I had no interior designer and no architect, we did it all in-house.” So the assistant leads me into a downstairs lavatory, naturally, because “celebrities have signed their autographs on the wall,” she explains, trying to find some names to show me but finding only that of Keith Lemon, who has written a pee joke. And then I find one myself, a message signed with a name that looks an awful lot like Alasdhair. Is this Stella’s husband, I ask?Oh yes, the assistant says!“I JUST WANT MY WIFE BACK,” it reads.

Soups and starters £5.50-£9 mains £8.50-£17 desserts £6 wines from £18Good things can come from bad. The bad thing in this case was the hopeful but inevitably hopeless trip I made a couple of weeks ago to the Holiday Inn on London’s Cromwell Road. I went for dinner, a word I’d put inside quotation marks to indicate irony, if the whole damn thing hadn’t traumatised the wryness out of me. To recap, I was invited by the executive chef and thought it would be rude to decline as it turned out, it would have been nowhere near as rude as the boiled egg they served as part of a caesar salad, which had a Shrek-green ring around the yolk through overboiling.Still, I am forever a starry-eyed optimist. Plus, I have a taste, verging on the obsessive, for a good Singapore laksa, that generous coconut milk-thickened, chilli-slicked broth, stacked with noodles, seafood, chicken and various other bits and bobs, which make life worth living. If there was the possibility of one of those in my future, Bugis Street demanded my attention.It’s the right place to seek it, though not because of the room. It is a masterful study in beige. Ceiling fans beat unnecessarily at the cool air of a London summer to summon up a tropical vibe, and there are wooden slatted screens on some of the windows. Ignore this. All the colour and drama will be on the table in front of you.It starts with their chicken satay. These are not the compressed cysts of tortured animal protein impaled on cocktail sticks and dyed yellow that fester in supermarket chiller cabinets across the land. These are smoky pieces of heavily spice-rubbed thigh, the occasional tassels of skin fired to crisp on the grill. There are singed bits and golden bits and roasted bits. With them is the requisite sauce that hits you first with the sweetness of peanut, but which keeps going with layers of spice and aromatics. At first you try to be refined, dipping the chicken in the sauce daintily. Then you take to dragging it through the bowl enthusiastically. Finally, you’re leaving the pieces of chicken on the plate and spooning the sauce over the top. There are, as there should be, cooling pieces of cucumber to settle everything down.From the list headed “Bugis Signatures” comes the classic nasi goreng, a huge plate of rust-coloured rice, mined with spiced chicken, prawns and a few peas for colour and pop, then topped with a fried egg, the yolk from which is just waiting to be pierced. With it comes a deep red sambal with huge toasted chilli notes with which to lubricate the rice and bring out the odd bead of sweat.And then, of course, there is the laksa. Oh, the laksa. If, like me, you have a mental laksa map, a geographical plotting of the best places for the dish, drop a pin for this one. The thicker rice noodles take me by surprise I’m used to thinner vermicelli, but these have a satisfying slurp. The broth is not overly sweetened. It’s a huge bash of chilli and stock and coconut. It bobs with prawns that have the bite of seafood cooked through only in the hot broth once it hit the bowl. I slurp and sip and dig about very happily.Singapore has long been a culinary crossroads, with ethnic groups being washed ashore in waves and bringing with them their food. So here is a terrifying-looking Malaysian chicken curry made with thigh served on the bone, in a bright red liquor beneath a surface puddle of orange oil perhaps half a centimetre deep. I worry it will be grim and greasy to eat, but it’s nothing of the sort. The pungent gravy seems to emulsify as it gets in your bowl. We have Nyonya pork, in a dark sauce full of cracked black pepper and sweet chilli. From a list of specials awaiting us on the table come chunks of long-braised pork belly, with jelly-like fat, served in a clay pot that’s so hot, the black sauce is still bubbling and spitting at us when it lands. It is a dish for which the words “yes please” were invented.The picture-led dessert menu offers a bunch of slightly worrying things, involving slippery bean curd or sweetened red-bean paste. We retreat to the safety of banana fritters in a palm sugar syrup. It’s unneeded and all the better for that. We drink very little, but there are beers and solid-looking wines for those who want them. Most dishes are priced from around a tenner and into the low teens, alongside set menu options for £12. It’s the sort of place where people come alone at lunchtime for a single plate of good food, and feel very comfortable doing so. If it were relevant, I might tell you it’s packed with people from South East Asia. That happens to be so. But it’s far more useful to know that its true claim on your attention goes far beyond simply being better than the Holiday Inn across the road.The Greyhound Café, the first London branch of a well-known Bangkok group, offers a sprightly, expansive take on the Thai repertoire. The dish names can be a little tiresome – there’s Salmon in Hot Pursuit, Bugs in My Salad, and Angry Pasta – but it’s all worth your time. The German style pork knuckle with a kicking tamarind curry paste is a standout, as is the Tom Yum soup with tiger prawns and prawn-stuffed dumplings.The Stockport Produce Hall, a site for various street food-style stands, has been criticised for not including enough independent traders in its repertoire, in favour of large-scale restaurant brands. Now they’ve announced that the brilliant Cambodian restaurant Angkor Soul from nearby Marple, will, have a presence there from this month.And on a similar subject Market Halls, which already operates ‘multi-vendor’ food courts in London’s Fulham and Victoria has received £20 million of backing from equity firm Bridgepoint Growth, to role the model out across the country. If the street food movement was once to the restaurant business what indie record labels once were to the majors, that moment appears to be passing.

It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

They share the sacrifice, solidarity – and ice baths – that got them to the World CupEmbarrassingly, there were tears running down my face when I stepped into the roaring stands for England’s first match of the 2019 Women’s World Cup in Nice. Football is just a game, but for women players it is hard to disengage from the sexism and stresses that accompany it. Watching Nikita Parris flowing down the wing, smashing in a penalty at the 14th minute, then Ellen White’s initial offside goal being rewarded by the real deal: I know how hard their predecessors had fought for these moments of unadulterated joy.The frenzy of press and promotion in the lead up to this year’s tournament was unprecedented. But Goal Click, a five-year-old social enterprise that sends disposable cameras to footballers around the world and then publishes the results online (alongside candid interviews), has been well ahead of the strike. Before the tournament, their cameras ended up in the hands of 18 international players, including England right-back Lucy Bronze, Jamaica defender Lauren Silver and USA midfielder Sam Mewis. All have captured the beautiful game in a singularly personal way.From the start, we have tried to represent the full ersity of the game,” says Goal Click co-founder Matthew Barrett. “Our second story was about an Indian girls football team in Mumbai.” Other projects have included the Homeless World Cup and the Single Leg Amputee Sports Association in Sierra Leone. “I have more interest in women’s football stories off the pitch because, quite frankly, they are deeper and more meaningful,” adds Barrett. The women’s game is known for its close friendships, and the photographs highlight these bonds, formed both at club and international level. “In the men’s game, I don’t think there is that same sense of camaraderie,” Barrett says. “You’re not best mates.”The photographs give an intimate view of life beyond the match-day theatrics. Chelsea players pile on to charter planes (the women’s game can’t afford private jets just yet) a Norwegian team play in the snow and Australians warm up on the beach. There are messy boot rooms, selfies and “leg-fies” by stars such as France’s Eugénie Le Sommer. Mewis’s image of USA teammates Rose Lavelle and Alex Morgan staring up at the camera as they kneel in an ice water bath is a particular highlight for Barrett: “It really stood out as a photo that could only have been taken by a teammate.”With Thailand striker Miranda Nild as one of his contributors, her team’s brutal 13-0 loss to the USA was difficult to sit through but surprisingly Barrett says he is glad it happened. “That scoreline is what used to happen in men’s football in the 1960s and 70s, before proper investment went into national sides.”Every player featured on these pages hopes to inspire a new generation, and my favourite shot from Goal Click’s project is of a teenage grassroots player – Sushanti Kumari in India, a football balanced on her nose above a wide smile. These are the girls who will have been watching these past weeks – who will feel the way I did in the stands in Nice, watching England v Scotland, surrounded by women wearing kilts and covered in facepaint: inspired.• To see more photographs from the project, visit goal-click"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68101a09fb88c1e7fb3560ff1c7ce4caa545cdc4/0_331_4384_2631/master/4384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9899ac77a190e64902d6db09055c9195","title":"usa megan rapinoe equal pay talks womens world cup","story":"• ‘We put on an incredible show. We cannot do anything more’• Equal pay chant rang around ground after World Cup finalMegan Rapinoe called for the conversation on equal pay to move forward after she helped USA to retain the World Cup.“I think everyone is ready for this conversation to move to the next step,” she said after hearing an “equal pay” chant ring round after the final and the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, being booed. “I think we’re done with: ‘Are we worth it, should we have equal pay, is the market the same?’ Yada yada.“Everyone’s done with that fans are done with that, players are done with that. In a lot of ways I think sponsors are done with that. Let’s get to the next point. What’s next? How do we support women’s federations and women’s programmes around the world? What can Fifa do to do that? What can we do to support the leagues around the world?” she said, having rocked into the press conference late, exclaiming “I just killed doping!”“We as players, every player at this World Cup, put on the most incredible show that you could ever ask for. We cannot do anything more to impress more, to be better ambassadors, to take on more, to play better or do anything. It’s time to take it forward to the next step. A little public shame never hurt anybody, right? I’m down with the boos.”The USA manager, Jill Ellis, paid tribute to her Golden Boot and Golden Ball winger and defended her outspoken ways. “Megan was built for this, built for these moments, built to be a spokesperson,” Ellis said. “She’s eloquent. She speaks well and from the heart. I never had any worries about Megan speaking out. The bigger the spotlight the more she shines.”Ellis praised the growth of the game after USA overcame tough tests against France, Spain and England on their way to the final. “I think the level overall around the world is growing exponentially,” she said. “This was incredibly difficult. I think the teams we’ve had to come through were very difficult.”There were rumblings of discontent within the camp, and with Ellis, after a disappointing exit to Sweden in the quarter-finals at the 2016 Olympics. Ellis, though, brushed off a potential ‘I told you so’ moment. “I don’t care,” she said. “I never read what people thought. I knew after 2016 we had to deconstruct and reconstruct. We just had to continue to evolve. Deepening our squad, giving more people opportunities, vetting people. I don’t have to talk about critics I don’t care. People out here know a tenth of what we do. I’m very proud of these players.”On her now signature arms-outstretched celebration Rapinoe said: “I’m generally pretty off the cuff, so I change them up a lot. This just seemed right in the moment to have me and what I stand for with a big shit-eating grin on my face. For all the women players who’ve played in this it’s iconic of what we go through but we still put this product out on the pitch. It seemed to be working in the moment.”Ellis was asked whether they would be invited to the White House. “I wouldn’t bet on that,” she replied with a grin.Trump tweeted: “Congratulations to the US Women’s Soccer Team on winning the World Cup! Great and exciting play. America is proud of you all!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/810abcf6abc6aded2e43a604c4b3f6a16fd6ba89/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b32a0f81058784f3ccba3b507469a03","title":"ifrah ahmed girl from mogadishu fgm","story":"Ifrah Ahmed refuses to let the horrific female genital mutilation she suffered at the age of eight define her. “I don’t want to be a victim. I want to be a voice,” says the 32-year-old campaigner.In the first 10 minutes it shows Aja Naomi King, who plays Ahmed as a 15-year-old girl, being violently gang-raped by Somali militants. After that, she makes the dangerous journey from Somalia to Ireland to seek asylum, too scared to question anything her male smugglers want her to do. Upon her arrival, a male gynaecologist examines her and tries to find out what has happened to her, but she has no words to explain it to the male translator, just tears. But then, about halfway through, with the help of other women, she starts to find her voice. By the end of the film, she is shouting about FGM in front of Barack Obama, making speeches at the United Nations and being praised by the president of Somalia.For Ahmed, who has devoted her life to campaigning against FGM and was instrumental in bringing about the 2012 legislation banning the practice in Ireland, the movie was an opportunity to challenge how survivors of FGM are perceived. “I don’t want people to see me as a victim. I want people to see me empowering other women. I want to show people that whatever Somali women have been through, we can be strong and overcome it.”She hopes that others who have suffered FGM will watch the film and feel less alone. “It’s hard for women to speak out about FGM. So when two young Somali women came up to me after watching the movie in Edinburgh and hugged me, and said: ‘Ifra, you are speaking for all of us,’ I felt so happy. I felt so proud.”It took courage for her to open up to the film’s director and scriptwriter, Mary McGuckian. “It’s not easy, sharing your story with the world. But if it helps women to realise that this cutting is something we should talk about it.”What happened when her grandmother held her down to be cut by her uncle in a small hut is told only in hints: a dirty razor covered in blood, the screams of a young child in intense pain. “It may be my story, but it is a story of many young women. Those are the people I am fighting for.”She is now an Irish citizen but spoke to the Observer this weekend from Somalia, where she runs her own foundation lobbying the government to make FGM illegal. Last year she made a short documentary about a 10-year-old girl who bled to death after having her genitals mutilated. It went viral, and suddenly parents started taking daughters they had cut to hospitals, where Ahmed facilitated their medical care. “In the last year we saved 20 girls from bleeding. And we lost seven.”She is determined to break the silence around FGM in Somalia, and runs community programmes to educate families. “When only women are in the room, they all agree FGM is a problem. But if there is even one man there they won’t speak out.” She hopes that by the end of the year, the Somali government will legislate to make it a criminal offence, so that families who practise FGM will face prosecution.Much depends on the outcome of the government’s consultation with influential religious leaders, which is happening at the moment. “My hope is that before the bill goes to parliament, religious leaders will understand the issue and support the legislation.”She knows how powerful her testimony can be in Somalia at such a time. “I can sit on TV, and talk about it. I can debate with the religious leaders and tell them my personal experiences.” She takes heart from the religious scholars who have seen her do this and then called her up to say: “We are behind you, and we will support you.”But she is aware that not everyone in the country feels that way, and she is risking her life by living there. “There is killing and bombing and a lot of problems here. I could escape to Ireland, but every day what keeps me going is that I’m making a difference.”She is not daunted by the scale of the problem she faces. The history of FGM in Somalia dates back over 400 years, and the film offers a little insight into the reasons women continue to cut their daughters. In a moving scene towards the end, Ahmed finally gets an opportunity to ask her beloved grandmother – who raised her from a baby – why she mutilated so many girls in their family.FGM is also viewed as a way of protecting daughters from terrible practices of their future husbands. “To keep her pure when he went away, she would be sewn up, so he would return to find her as if they were on their first night,” Ahmed’s grandmother tells her.“I want this movie to travel the world,” says Ahmed. “I want to reach the decision-makers, the leaders and the young people, who are the future.” She is full of hope. “My hope is to raise awareness. What happened to me cannot be changed. My past is my past. But what I can do is change the future.“Girls are being traumatised by FGM. Children are dying. I hope people will watch this movie and understand that this has to end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ebf5f486d676807a5eee8b04b400dc84a42b94/0_56_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a2c88d4d51bff04d15b6060e525ce3e","title":"no ticket to ride trapped without passports zimbabwe","story":"With the registry office facing a backlog of 280,000 applications, some people have waited close to a year to work or study abroadEvery morning for the past two months Eldah Makuvise, 35, has braved the cold winter mornings to queue for her passport at the local registry office in Harare, Zimbabwe. Each time she’s been sent away in despair.Makuvise’s application, like others submitted a year ago, is stuck in a huge passport backlog.Zimbabwe’s passport office has seen an influx of applications as economic woes push more people to search for work in other countries.The registry office can only process 50 passports a day. It has bemoaned the lack of foreign currency available to import paper and is now faced with a backlog of 280,000 applications.The Zimbabwe human rights commission has begun inquiries into the delay of passports and national identification documents following a public outcry.Makuvise and her friend, Moreen, 30, have resorted to taking turns sleeping in the queue to better their chances of being served the following day.Makuvise’s hopes of working in South Africa are slowly fading.Millions of Zimbabweans left the country over the past two decades of economic mismanagement by longtime leader Robert Mugabe.Things have not improved under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power in a military coup in 2017.Mnangagwa, who promised a “new dispensation”, ran into challenges in his first year in office. The possibility of getting a bailout loan from international financial institutions remains a distant dream because of human rights violations.The return of the Zimbabwean dollar is expected to worsen the economic situation as it remains weaker against other currencies, including the US dollar.Applicants in need of medical attention abroad have also borne the brunt of passport challenges in Zimbabwe.Cleopatra Arufandika, 45, is due a major operation in India in the next month, after suffering a hip dislocation.Accompanied by her son, Marlvin, she hoped her predicament would persuade the authorities to fast-track her application. But Arufandika was turned away.“I am in pain and my hospital booking is in a month. My family have already spent a lot of money on treatment. All I want is to get better,” Arufandika says.Arufandika has been pleading with the authorities and hopes for a better response at her next appointment.The passport situation has also dashed the hopes of students wishing to study abroad.Taurai Dyanda, 18, who was due to start at university in China in May, has called on the government to expedite travel documents for students.“I applied for my passport in September last year ,but almost a year later nothing has come. I have already missed the May intake and I’m forced to plead with my sponsors,” Dyanda says.“I won a scholarship to study civil engineering and I don’t think it’s fair for young people to lose opportunities like these.”Hopes are also fading for Thelma Ndebele, 22, a prospective medical student.“I should have gone to school in February and I have been turned away from the passport office for the fourth time. Now they want me to give an extra ZWD 53 to improve my chances of getting the passport, which cannot be guaranteed. I cannot continue to stay here while my friends are studying,” Ndebele says.The government this week admitted that they are facing a backlog dating back to July 2018.Home affairs minister Cain Mathema has promised to improve the process within a month. He says the Treasury has purchased new machines to print travel documents at a cost of nearly $600,000 (£480,000).“We can promise that within the next four to five weeks we’ll be able to produce 3,000 passports a day. The president had to intervene. Our ultimate goal is to produce at least 8,000 a day,” says Mathema."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62beaf9c1a5fd8c256ddb59246b9dda8f839f83b/0_297_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e227d7c5a22d04b73ad854ad3aea73","title":"were you and your partner married by a loved one in an unofficial ceremony","story":"Who did you choose to conduct your ceremony and why?

One of the most popular boys’ names of the postwar era is facing oblivion if current trends continue, as the speed with which parents tire of old names and rally around new ones appears to be accelerating.Lee, Ross and Shaun are on their way out too, according to analysis of changes in baby names between 1996 and 2017, the latest year for which official data is available for England and Wales. The writing is also on the wall for Jodie and Gemma, with only 20 of each named in 2017 compared with well over 1,000 each in 1996.The changes come as parents flock to alternative spellings and to names such as Khaleesi, an honorific title used in the TV fantasy drama Game of Thrones, in what academics have identified as a pursuit of “virtue in rarity”. For boys, the fastest-rising name is Jaxon, which is as popular now as Mark was in 1996, while for girls it is Aria, as popular as Hayley was 23 years ago.Scotland, which might be expected to be a safe haven for a name thought to be derived from the Scottish gaelic for stone, creag, produced only 23 last year. Even prominent Craigs appeared unsure about whether their fading name is worth defending.“I blame my mother,” said Craig Whittaker, MP for Calder Valley, when asked about his name. “I am conscious that very few people seem to be called Craig. Actually, I am proud of my name, despite what I just said about my mother. There you go, a U-turn on my name in 30 seconds flat.”Things look even worse for Kirsty, whose 2017 cohort of 11 would only just fill a football team, although the broadcaster Kirsty Wark, remained confident for her name’s future. “There’s loads of us – Kirstie Allsopp, Kirsty Young,” she said. “Luckily, there are a few of us around to keep the flag flying.”In any event, it turns out that Wark is a Kirsteen, but isn’t known by it because “they kept calling me Kirsty at university”.Academics at Oxford University who have analysed 170 years of UK names, including the fashion for Old Testament names like Enoch and Cephas in the 19th century and the rise in Indian names after independence in 1947, have found that name choices form “a self-correcting feedback loop, whereby rarer names become common because there are virtues perceived in their rarity, yet with these perceived virtues lost upon increasing commonality”.The search for distinctiveness has thrown up unique spellings, with Abbiegayle, Abagael, Abygayle, Abaigael and Abbygael all deployed only once each between 1998 and 2013.“Towards the present day, we can speculate that the comparatively greater range of media, freedom of movement, and ability to maintain globally distributed social networks increases the number of possible names, but also ensures they may more quickly be perceived as commonplace,” Dr Stephen Bush wrote in his analysis of name choices from 1838 to 2016.“Consequently, contemporary naming vogues are relatively short-lived, with many name choices appearing a balance struck between recognisability and rarity.”Among the fastest-rising names reflecting the growth of the UK’s Muslim population are Ameerah, Aasiyah and Imaan for girl and Musa, Dawud and Zayn for boys.“They are making a mistake,” said Lee Mallett, a writer born in 1957, who said his name had served him well, not least providing a platform for his Lee Marvin impersonation aged 13.“It was rare where I was growing up in rural Lincolnshire and somewhat glamorously American. It was always memorable, and sounded different when other people spoke it to other more popular names. Thanks, Mum and Dad.”Extinction, albeit perhaps temporary, may already have arrived for Lindsay, Lynsey or Lyndsey and Christie or Kristy – the Office for National Statistics has no record of anyone taking those names in 2017. The future is looking grave, too, for Jordan and BrittanyBritney, names borrowed perhaps from two pop culture icons: the glamour model Katie Price, who used the name Jordan, and US singer Britney Spears.But there is hope yet for Craig, said Dr Bush, who observed that its current problems may stem from it seeming like “a dad name”. “Someone is going to reappraise it in the future,” he said. “It’s rare that names disappear completely.”One that has gone is the name given to the third daughter of the Old Testament prophet, Job. His other two daughters, Kezia and Jemima, remain in use, but Keren-happuch hasn’t been used since at least 1996.

Dr Mathew White, who led the study, suggested that a sense of tranquility could be key. Starting your day with a coffee in the garden, or even near an open window, is a simple way to inspire calm. Going outside during your lunch break or spending a few minutes looking at the night sky before bed are other ideas.Leanne Manchester of the Wildlife Trusts encourages people to take a closer look at plants, trees and even weeds. “Stop to watch bees buzzing around flowers. There’s life everywhere, but it is so easy to miss it instead, slow down, stop and notice it.” Claire Francis of the charity Sensory Trust says: “Getting outdoors and connecting with nature needn’t involve a five-mile hike.” Jo Phillips, a director of the Forest School Association, suggests looking for “five beautiful things” to engage your senses. “It could be a flower, the clouds, lichen on trees, or the natural light.”Getting off the bus a stop early or going for a walk during breaks at work are simple ways to increase exposure to nature, says Manchester. If you’re walking with someone, Phillips suggests pointing out elements that have caught your eye, especially if you are with children. “Looking after the planet needs to become a priority, so we should do everything we can to ensure the parents of the future have memorable experiences in nature, so they can pass on that knowledge to their children.”With more than 62,000 urban green spaces in Great Britain, one should never be too far away. The Wildlife Trusts has a searchable online map of its nature reserves, almost all of which have free entry it also provides a list of accessible nature reserves. Greenspace, a downloadable layer in Ordnance Survey maps, is said to be Britain’s most comprehensive catalogue of green spaces for leisure and recreation.“For those who can’t get outside, bird boxes close to a window can provide interest all year round, as can growing and nurturing plants on a windowsill,” says Francis. As part of the Wildlife Trusts’ 30 Days Wild campaign, a pack has been designed to help care home residents feel closer to nature. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds holds its Big Garden Birdwatcheach year, at the end of January.This involves spending an hour observing birds – and you can even do it from a window with a good view."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e372b443c67047f8bfab73f549c880e83b3a545f/0_0_1748_1049/master/1748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbaa07fb5594b3a71d60e2bc4f762642","title":"no coventry is not basically birmingham the unwritten rules of the west midlands","story":"One local explains how to navigate Elephant City with some insider tips and tricksCoventry. A city that is unfortunately so near to Birmingham that it is often forgotten about, but also fortunately just far enough away that we don’t speak with that accent. In fact, “we speak with an accent that’s exceedingly rare!” At least that’s what the Coventry City fans sing every week, whether it’s at the Ricoh Arena or at away games up and down the country – or that season we played our home games in Northampton, but we don’t talk about that.Luckily, due to our location on one of the country’s most central rail lines, it’s incredibly easy for us to get to just about anywhere in the UK, whether it be for football, shopping, boozing, sightseeing, or … what else is there?And if you’re coming to us by rail (TIP: London Northwestern Railway has FREE wifi in every carriage), there are some unspoken things you should know about us lot, located smack bang in the middle of England.No, Coventry is not basically BirminghamThis assertion is lazy geography. We are 20 miles away from Birmingham. Sunderland is barely 15 miles away from Newcastle upon Tyne but you wouldn’t say “Newcastle is basically in Sunderland”, unless you wanted to get banished from the north-east forever. Solihull is a town that is “basically” Birmingham. We are our own city, with enough cathedrals to spare (more on that in a minute).Coventry – and its spirit – is indestructibleDue to our extremely central location – Meriden, the traditional centre of England is just 8 miles away – we’ve often found ourselves in the middle of some heated situations. The most notable of which was the Coventry blitz, which took place on the night of the 14 November 1940. It was the single most concentrated attack on a British city during the second world war. It lasted for 11 hours as the Luftwaffe essentially attempted to knock Coventry off the map, being one of the UK’s major centres for war production. The old cathedral was mostly destroyed during that raid, but its remains now serve as a phenomenal event space.We also have a rich history of cathedralsWhile the old cathedral was destroyed, as mentioned, we had an old, old cathedral that Henry VIII ordered to be destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century. What remains of it is still standing and open to the public in the Priory undercrofts, which was dug up by Tony Robinson for a Time Team special in 1999 on Channel 4. Side note: There is a Nando’s right next to the Priory gardens, so you can make a decent afternoon of history and chicken.Enjoy flying abroad? You have us to thank for thatIf we are honest, we aren’t the greatest at making a big deal about the things we’ve done in the past. For a city that was essentially the beating heart of the country’s motor industry, we should at least talk about it as much as Brummies like to talk about how they are the second city.But more impressive than that is Coventry’s very own Sir Frank Whittle. No, it’s not just the name of a school in Walsgrave – Sir Frank Whittle was the genius behind the modern jet engine, which effectively changed the world.When Sir Frank first brought forward his plans to the UK’s Air Ministry in 1929, his blueprints were called “impractical”. Just eight years later, in 1937, his Whittle Unit engine roared into life, and by 1941 jet-powered planes were heading to war. The rest, as they say, is history.If you call it the Phoenix or the Kasbah, we know you are a studentClubs change names, that’s true, but we never forget – or stop calling them by – their older names.That club on Primrose Hill Street in Hillfields is The Colly (or Colosseum for the more formal among you) not the Kasbah, despite what it says above the doors. Those who really know their history will recall a brief period in the early 90s when it was called the Tic Toc, and played host to Blur and Ocean Colour Scene amid Britpop fever. The Phoenix?

Over time this evolved into “process of baking” to “event of baking” to “the set of things baked” and eventually to a “set of things”, ie a batch. And these bread rolls would be baked in batches too.

Putting that extra money into an ISA or an investment portfolio, however, could make a real differencePutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Most investments should be considered as a medium- to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

Apart from the flop against England and the near stumble against Afghanistan, India are in fine fettle. A postmortem followed the peculiar run chase against England and when they next chased, against Sri Lanka at Headingley, they clocked off with six overs to spare. The last-minute change of semi-final has caused havoc for thousands of India fans who flocked to resale ticket sites, but India now have the easiest task against an off-colour and downhearted New Zealand.Any injury worries? They lost Vijay Shankar with a broken toe and Shikhar Dhawan to a fractured thumb earlier in the tournament. Jasprit Bumrah has recovered from an injury scare against Afghanistan.Who is their key man? Virat Kohli. India’s fire and ice. He has made five fifties holding the middle order together, without yet going on to get a hundred. He is due. Also an arch manipulator of his bowling attack.Batting health check Rohit Sharma has been eating runs for breakfast, his century against Sri Lanka was his record-breaking fifth of the tournament and he is the competition’s leading run scorer with 647. KL Rahul has also chipped in with 359 runs but, Kohli apart, the middle order have not quite fired. Rishabh Pant adds fire MS Dhoni’s powers seem to be waning.Bowling health check The power is with Bumrah, the awkward clockwork marionette, the ace at the start of the innings, and at the death, with 17 wickets. Mohammed Shami is also a threat.What shape are they in? They were first to qualify for the knockout stages but have lost twice: against India, badly, then unexpectedly against South Africa in the final game of the round robin, which knocked them off top spot. They walked off the pitch at Old Trafford down at mouth and carry into the semi-final against England a hint of vulnerability – injury-hit and now destined for a must-win game at Edgbaston, a venue they have not yet played at in this tournament.Any injury worries? Walking wounded. Usman Khawaja is out of the tournament after pulling his left hamstring against South Africa, leading to the call-up of Matthew Wade from the Australia A squad. Mitch Marsh has been drafted in as cover from there after Marcus Stoinis suffered a reoccurrence of his side strain in the same game. Starc was also seen clutching his knee. Shaun Marsh’s World Cup is over, after fracturing an arm in the nets. The only advantage of the Edgbaston semi-final is two days more recovery time.Who is their key man? David Warner, back to his belligerent, brilliant best, with three hundreds and 600 runs in the group stage, nine runs behind Sharma. Booing? What booing.Batting health check Warner apart, Alex Carey hit the ball superbly against South Africa and Aaron Finch has also crashed more than 500 runs.Bowling health check Starc, player of the tournament in 2015, is well on the way to winning his second consecutive award. He has 26 wickets, equalling Glenn McGrath’s World Cup record, though he was oddly off‑colour against South Africa.What shape are they in? After hobbling through the early stages, losing against Pakistan and Sri Lanka as well as Australia, they laughed in the face of pressure in their two must-win games, easing to victory against India and thrashing New Zealand. They have re-embraced their favourite no-fear brand: Jonny Bairstow has fired himself up courtesy of Michael Vaughan, Jason Roy’s return is a calming influence, and the Liam Plunkett for Moeen Ali swap gives Morgan peace of mind in the middle overs. A semi‑final against Australia at England’s favourite ground – Edgbaston – is far preferable to the chance of meeting them in the final at Lord’s, where they rampaged in the group stages.Any injury worries? Roy’s torn hamstring seems to be holding together after he missed three games as does Mark Wood’s dodgy ankle and Adil Rashid’s shoulder.Who is their key man? Morgan – England’s inner calm in a group of hot heads. He also needs to win the toss. But, after being bounced out by Mohammed Shami, he can expect Starc to be licking his lips.Batting health check Good. England have scored seven centuries from five men, plus the ever-reliable Ben Stokes is averaging 55, so they are not as overly reliant on a batting talisman as the other semi-finalists. Jos Buttler has been quiet since his 75-ball hundred against Pakistan.Bowling health check Just in time, they have stumbled on their best attack. Wood, Jofra Archer, Plunkett and Chris Woakes pose a near and present danger. Only Rashid has not fully fired yet.What shape are they in? Limping. They qualified with the lowest number of wins of any of the semi-finalists, on the back of three successive defeats, the last a whipping by England by 119 runs at Chester-le-Street. Finishing equal with Pakistan on points, they scraped through on run rate. The phlegmatic Kane Williamson has talked of “learning curves” and wiping the slate clean. But, even if they have lost the pizzazz that got them to the final in 2015 under Brendan McCullum, this is their fourth consecutive World Cup semi‑final – they know what they are doing. Their secret weapon against India on Tuesday may be the weather: rain is forecast.Any injury worries? Lockie Ferguson, NZ’s Errol Flynn and the team’s leading wicket-taker, missed the thrashing by England because of a hamstring niggle. His absence reduced Williamson’s ability to shuffle his bowlers. New Zealand expect him to be fit to face India.Batting health check Worrying. The top five have not found a way to fire together. Martin Guptill – three single-figure scores in the past four innings – and Ross Taylor, with a propensity for being run out, need runs.Bowling health check Trent Boult with his knuckle balls and last‑overs reverse swing and Ferguson’s pace – up at about 93mph – give New Zealand a chance of a surprise if their batsmen can get enough runs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d7b200e0aa5e209d1bd57fb80cdec69ca597c50/67_358_4505_2704/master/4505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d5b402ff89d84f24ee6e9f47c70277","title":"bose frames review smart audio sunglasses are a blast","story":"Music without earbuds looks and sounds surprisingly good, making these smart glasses the antithesis of Google GlassThe Bose Frames are the answer to the question: what if your sunglasses were also a set of smart, hidden headphones with no earbuds or no bone-conduction system, just a set of personal speakers?As a wearer of true wireless earbuds, that’s not a question I ever thought I would ask. But the Bose Frames are delightful and leaving your ears free of buds or headphoneshas a clear and obvious case.The term “smart glasses”’ might conjure up visions of Google’s ill-fated Glass, but the Bose Frames are not in the same league. There’s no screen, camera or any visible signs of “smart” from the front. Instead they have built-in sensors and a pair of hidden speakers, which pipe music to your ears.Bose has nailed the design of the Frames. They look like regular unisex sunglasses. Granted, the arms are a bit thicker and wider near the ears, where traditional sunglasses would taper, and there’s a small gold button for turning them on and controlling music. But I was happy wearing them when not listening to music.There’s a choice of two frames: the larger, squarer Alto (as tested) and the smaller, rounder Rondo. Both are made from black nylon, come with black lenses and look fairly generic.They’re comfortable to wear for extended periods without pinching on the nose or ears, and fold up just like any regular set. They weigh 45g, which is about the weight of a thicker set of premium sunglasses.If I was to nitpick I would say that the black frames look a little cheap and almost too generic. But the fact that’s even worth mentioning is testament to how not like other smart glasses the Frames are.In terms of raw sound quality, the Frames sound like a very open set of quality earbuds. They lack deep bass, but give them something complex and they shine with energy and warmth, with excellent separation and clarity.The one thing the Frames can’t do that earbuds can is protect you from the loud din of a city. You can forget hearing music on a screeching train or while walking by a working jackhammer. In this regard they are very much like Apple’s popular AirPods.The Frames support standard Bluetooth audio (SBC) as well as the higher quality AAC audio, and had rock-solid connectivity with both Android phones and the iPhone. No noticeable lipsync issues were present either, which made the Frames great for watching video.The microphone was surprisingly good, picking up my voice clearly for the other end of the call (or Google AssistantSiri). Be warned though: with no earbuds visible people think you’re talking to yourself.Turning on the Frames is as easy as pressing the single discreet button under the right arm. The button also serves for pauseplay or accepting a call. Double press to skip forward, triple for back. Anyone who has used wireless earbuds before will be familiar with this.To switch them off just turn them upside down for a second or so. It all works great. The one thing they’re missing is volume control, so you’ll be reaching for your phone for that, which is a shame.You get just over three hours of continuous listening out of the Frames before the battery runs dry, which is normally enough. Charging is fairly slow and needs a proprietary magnetic USB cable that snaps on to the inside of the right arm.The Frames come with a traditional sunglasses case, which is a missed opportunity. Most true wireless earbuds last about three hours, but are charged multiple times by their case. The Frames could really do with a battery in the case. It’s too easy to forget to charge them, turning them into standard sunglasses.The smart bit of the Frames is support for the firm’s audio augmented reality platform, Bose AR, which is also available on the Bose’s popular QC35 II headphones, and on the upcoming Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.The Frames know which way you’re facing and your location from the GPS on your phone, so you can use audio to feed information about the real world into your ears.But the platform only supports iOS at the moment and lacks a killer app. The best of the bunch are some 3D audio experiences, a golf app that can tell you where the hole is and some walking directions. None of them were interesting enough to use beyond novelty, but Bose AR has potential.For comparison, the Oakley Radar Pace, which has in-ear buds attached to the sunglasses, costs £400 while various bone conduction sunglasses cost from about £100.Clearly this is a massive advantage for cyclists or pedestrians, but it also means you’re subjected to the noise of the world around you. For anyone who always walks around with earbuds in, as I do, this can be quite overwhelming when you first start out.They look good enough that I ended up wearing them even when not listening to music. And when you do switch them on they sound surprisingly good, with rich audio that sparkles with the right track. There’s simply no comparison with bone conduction or similar other non-earbud personal audio technologies.Listening to your tunes while still being able to hear the great outdoors while sitting in the garden or park in brilliant sunshine is thoroughly enjoyable. Trying to listen to a podcast while travelling on London’s noisy Piccadilly line, not so much.So the Frames will never be the only set of headphones you need, and they could do with a battery in the case, volume controls and a few more styles, not to mention prescription lenses and some killer Bose AR apps.But even at £200 the Bose Frames are the most interesting piece of wearable technology I have donned since the original Google Glass.Pros: music without blocking your ears or making a racket for others, look good, choice of lenses and frames, comfortable, sound good, solid Bluetooth connection, excellent call qualityCons: no battery in the case and only 3.5 hours between charges, will never be your only set of earphones, can’t protect from noise of the outside world, AR potential unrealised This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Bathers should rinse their bodies before getting in the bath. And remain naked at all times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58ef5cc956bde4ed6b3598245336f903cdb9aad/0_76_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90e99468e2be959e36d0ac155e0113e3","title":"pride in london parade in pictures","story":"Huge crowds gather on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3949479.1562520381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 600 000 in vacant site levies paid in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe contentious Kilmainham site is on the corner of Old Kilmainham Road and the South Circular Road.

It had 30 years ago intended to use the land to build a youth detention facility but the project proceeded. In 2015 it was agreed to transfer the site to the council for social housing. The council nominated Novas Indicatives, a voluntary housing body, to develop the site with apartments for homeless women.Novas secured planning permission for the apartments in 2016, but no development has taken place and the site remains vacant.The transfer has yet to occur because the council had told the prison service Novas required freehold title and the site was a leasehold property with 750 years yet to run. The prison service said it remained “fully committed” to transferring the property and had been waiting to hear back from the council as to whether a leasehold title would be acceptable.The council told the board the land fell within the definition of a vacant site and remained in the Minister’s ownership. It said it would welcome development of the site and once construction starts it could consider removing it from the register. But unless and until that happens the levy was owed.Department ‘not unfairly targeted’The board said the levy had been correctly calculated and the council’s demand should be met.The council’s head of planning, Richard Shakespeare, said the department had not been unfairly targeted and the council was seeking payment for all 68 sites on the register.“It is important that we do not show favour to the State or to ourselves. We are fining ourselves, on our own vacant sites, and these are not just circular payments. The money is used for regeneration purposes in the area where it is raised.”Mr Shakespeare said he was happy with the rate of payments received so far, with €627,450 paid. But the real success of the levy was in the number of sites that had been brought into use to avoid its payment.“We issued 121 notices of entry on the site. There are currently 68 sites on the register and the majority of the others that came off are now being developed. We expect that rate to increase with the levy rising to 7 per cent next year.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3949995.1562566604!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government to ramp up no deal brexit preparations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government will this week launch another wave of no-deal Brexit preparations. Photograph: Pavel GolovkinAPThe Government will this week launch another wave of no-deal Brexit preparations.It will urge State agencies, Government departments, businesses and the public to prepare for the likelihood of the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union on October 31st.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will bring three memos to Cabinet on Tuesday dealing with various aspects of no-deal preparations. Sources briefed on their contents say there is a need to shift preparations for a British crash-out into a new gear, as officials increasingly view a no-deal exit as a likely outcome.Effectively, officials will begin a countdown to a no-deal exit, which will take place – in the absence of agreement between the UK and the EU, or another extension – in 115 days from today.Sources concede the Government will be faced with questions about how it reconciles the twin objectives of maintaining no Border infrastructure while protecting the single market, though it is not expected that the memos this week will offer definitive answers to this vexed question.It is expected that Ministers will be briefed at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting on the threats to the all-Ireland economy and especially to small businesses in the North, in the event of no-deal.One of the biggest dangers Ireland faces, he adds, is “the boy who cried wolf effect . . . whereby people and business assume that because a disorderly Brexit was averted in March and April the same will happen in October.”“To assume this would be a serious error,” says Mr Coveney.He reiterates that the Government will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and strongly defends the backstop. This is the mechanism that was designed to ensure a seamless Border on the island of Ireland after the UK’s departure from the EU.However, Mr Coveney also concedes that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the backstop will disappear in which case the all-Ireland economy will be in particular danger.The Dáil is due to debate the Government’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit on Thursday, before the summer recess.Meanwhile, Conservative leadership contenders Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have made clear that they would leave without a deal on October 31st if there is no renegotiation of the agreement and the Northern Ireland backstop in particular.With little prospect of meaningful exchanges between London and Brussels in August, sources on all sides acknowledge that a no-deal countdown will be well under way by September.MPs at Westminster could use a Northern Ireland Bill on Monday to block Mr Johnson from suspending parliament to force through a no-deal exit in October – something which he has threatened to do.What will happen to the North?Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve said the Bill, which would delay Stormont elections while powersharing talks continue, is a legitimate mechanism to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal.“Northern Ireland and Brexit go rather closely together. The chances are, if Brexit goes through – a no-deal Brexit – it is going to be the end of Northern Ireland’s union with the United Kingdom, with serious political consequences flowing from it,” he told the BBC. “That’s a Bill that is a perfectly legitimate place to start looking at how one might make sure no-deal Brexits are fully debated before they take place.”The Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill would delay the need to hold an Assembly election until October 21st, with the option of a further extension until January 2020. It would also give civil servants more clarity about what decisions they can make in the absence of an Executive.With parliament due to go into recess on July 25th and the current extension expiring on August 25th, the government hopes to pass all stages of the Bill on Monday.Armagh-born Labour MP Conor McGinn has tabled an amendment that would oblige the British government to introduce same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland if the Stormont institutions have not been restored within three months. Mr McGinn’s amendment has cross-party support and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said last week that the government would allow a free vote on the issue.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

She had been forced to marry him at 16.Shakila Zareen’s fingernails are painted in alternate colours of rose pink and glittery blue. She’s wearing a vividly embroidered red dress and gold pumps, pink lipstick and bronze eyeshadow. She’s 24, and sitting on a sofa overlooking the Vancouver waterfront she flashes a beautiful but lopsided smile.On one side of her face there is no eye socket and a scar that tells the story of the day her life changed forever. Tomorrow morning she will have her 11th round of reconstructive surgery.Half of Shakila’s face was blown away when her husband shot her in her home country of Afghanistan. She had been forced to marry him at the age of 16.“He hit me and abused me on a daily basis. He and his family members sexually assaulted me. One day I reported him to the police. When he found out, he shot me in the face. I lost the child I was carrying.”Even though speaking up cost Shakila her face and her country, she has chosen to speak out again to try to help others caught up in early or forced marriages. At the launch of a global call to end child marriage at this month’s Women Deliver conference on gender equality in Vancouver, she had a clear and emphatic message.“This attack did not make me weak, it made me stronger. I want to be a voice for all the girls who don’t have a voice.”More than 700 million women alive today were married before the age of 18.It’s estimated that one in five were married before the age of 15. Almost half of all “child brides” live in south Asia and 17 per cent in Africa.The global partnership to end child marriage, Girls Not Brides, says child marriage often ends girls’ education, reduces their lifelong income and, as in Shakila’s case, exposes them to the risk of domestic violence. Early pregnancy also puts girls’ lives and health at risk the leading cause of death among girls age 15-19 in developing countries is childbirth.According to Unicef, nine out of the 10 countries with the highest child marriage rates are fragile or extremely fragile states, with girls more vulnerable to child marriages during and after conflict, displacement, and natural disasters. Girls are also at risk of abduction involving child marriage, such as the Yazidi girls captured by Islamic State, and Nigerian girls captured by Boko Haram.In some countries such as Afghanistan, a culture of gender inequality and violence against women is deeply ingrained. After Shakila was shot, her mother took to her hospital in Kabul. The Indian government brought her to Delhi for treatment and, facing threats from her husband, she was granted asylum in the US.But under the Trump administration this was revoked. She eventually made her way to Canada with her mother. Her husband was arrested but was released on bail and never prosecuted.Speaking up“When I was a kid I always noticed women don’t speak up against violence,” she says. “The law is made by men, for men. The first thing I would like to see is that domestic violence is made a crime and that the law is enforced.”“Shakila’s story is the story of many girls, who are not as visible but whose cases are just as heart-breaking,” says Dana Buzbucea, World Vision’s advocacy leader.“Norms create such a pressure, that standing up for your own rights is amazingly inspiring. She was extremely brave.”Now settled in Canada, Shakila cannot imagine going back to Afghanistan. However, she is in contact with other young women there via social media, and believes coverage of what happened to her has made a difference.“Other people, when they heard my story, decided not to be silent anymore. I cannot support others girls financially but I can introduce them to other people, tell them how to get out of an abusive relationship, where to get help”.While global NGOs campaign against early and child marriage at a governmental and international level, they recognise that one of the most effective way to change attitudes and behaviour is within communities.In countries that don’t have proper child-protection systems or legal enforcement of marriage age, agencies such as World Vision often work with faith leaders. The Vancouver call to action asks them to speak out against child marriage and refuse to perform marriage ceremonies.Meryem Yusuf was married at the age of 12 to a much older man. She came to Vancouver from Ethiopia to share her story and inspire other advocates. “I was in grade five. I loved school, but my family decided, without my knowledge, to give me into a marriage. They wanted the financial gain. When I tried to keep going to school, my mother threw stones at me.”Meryem had five children, and ensured they all got an education. Later she decided she wanted to do something to help other girls. As a leader of a women’s Muslim association she trained with World Vision, and started working with her neighbours to dissuade them from marrying off their daughters. She says she has directly prevented 10 child marriages and now works with other women’s groups, teachers and health workers at a local level.Direct action“Sometimes I hear what is happening from children at school and then I go to talk to the parents. I tell them my life experience. I tell them I still blame my parents and that their children will blame them in future.”One of the noticeable features of the Women Deliver conference was the number of young women from developing countries advocating directly, and rejecting the concept of their needs being decided by NGOs, donors or governments.“Nothing for us without us. We are not going to be ‘beneficiaries’ anymore. It’s 2019,” said 18-year-old Natasha Mwansa from Zambia, who received a standing ovation while sharing a stage with the prime minister of Canada and the presidents of Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana.“This is about female empowerment. I hate when we call it child marriage. It’s paedophilia, it’s inhumane. We can’t have girls being married off, we can’t have girls missing out on their education.”Natasha, who is a student at the University of Zambia, said young women needed capacity building and literacy to be able to express their needs. “If you don’t know healthcare is a right not a privilege, how can you demand it?”For Girls Not Brides, the next step is to break the taboo around sexuality in the discussion of child marriage. A new report, Tackling the Taboo, states that control of adolescent girls’ sexuality is one of the main drivers of child marriage. Programmes addressing sexual and reproductive rights and health are beginning in even the most conservative societies, and in some countries child marriage rates have started to fall.Sexual health“We need to get sexual health information out into communities, and to ensure that contraceptives are available,” says Mabel van Oranje of Girls not Brides. “Otherwise young people who want to have fun for a night or a week will end up in a child marriage.”Oranje points out that young boys are also at risk of child marriage. Fundamentally, addressing the issue of child marriage means making sure that young women and men have the right to decide if, whom and when they marry and have children.For Shakila, the next challenge on the agenda is another round of surgery to reconstruct her nose. After that, surgeons will move on to her eye socket. When she came to Canada she stopped wearing an eye patch and faces the world on her own terms.“My face and looks are getting better,” she says. “But to do that they always have to take a bit of flesh from my body, like my chin or my thigh. So I will always carry the scars.”She remains open to the possibility of marrying again, but this time it would be her choice. “Why not, if it is a man who respects women, who does not see women as below him. Beauty and looks should not be important, if we love each other.”Despite what she has been through, Shakila retains hope, strength and a determination to define the terrain she campaigns on. “I want people to remember that we are not victims. We are the survivors. We are warriors.”World Vision and Girls Not Brides: six-point call to action to combat child marriage 1. Adopt or enforce legislation with 18 as the legal age for marriage.2. Listen to girls and empower and support them.3. Invest in education systems that guarantee girls access.4. Invest in changing harmful traditional norms and practices that condone child marriage by scaling up national awareness-raising campaigns.5. Recognise the heightened risk of child marriage in emergencies and fragile contexts.6. Invest in services to rehabilitate victims of child marriage."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

Mr Isaac was speaking at the launch of a report by the think-tank Theos about faith on campus.“We are living in an age of hypersensitivity where it is increasingly easier for people to feel offended - or others to be worried about protecting minority groups,” he said.  Last year, a pro-life student group was refused permission to set up stalls at three different university freshers’ fairs.The charity, called Life, wrote to the independent regulator of higher education in England to express concern about discriminatory behaviour and freedom of expression violations… by a number of university student unions. In 2017, an Oxford College banned the Christian Union from its freshers’ fair on the grounds that it would be “alienating” for students of other religions, and constitute a “micro-aggression”.The organiser of Balliol’s fair argued Christianity’s historic use as “an excuse for homophobia and certain forms of neo-colonialism” meant that students might feel “unwelcome” in their new college if the Christian Union had a stall.At the time,  the vice-president of Balliol’s Junior Common Room (JCR) committee, said that if a representative from the Christian Union attended the fair, it could cause potential harm to freshers.  NHS pensions: waiting lists soaring as consultants refuse to work overtimeBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullComment: Labour is now a racist party, and the only honourable course of action for members who care is to leave Air pollution could shorten a child\u0026#39s life by up to seven monthsComment: Phil Neville is right: a good effort isn\u0026#39t the same thing as a triumph London commuters urged to turn off Wi-Fi on their phones to avoid having their every move trackedJeremy Hunt challenges Boris Johnson to rule out handing Nicola Sturgeon more tax powersSouth Korean man \u0026#39politely\u0026#39 holds up bank - but it wasn\u0026#39t money or valuables he wantedAmnesty identifies new \u0026#39killing field\u0026#39 in Philippines drugs war ahead of key UN voteChris Grayling accused of trying to \u0026#39silence\u0026#39 road hauliers over no-deal BrexitComment: We must help the young overcome the poverty of hope hanging over their generationMussel shortage warning as study shows noise stunts their growth More than two thirds of millennials believe their generation will be \u0026#39worse off\u0026#39 than their parents’Almost 3,000 suspected child sex offenders released without any conditions to stop them approaching victimsNo major UK politician trusted by public on immigration, poll showsJeremy Hunt champions Christians facing persecution as he pledges \u0026#39religious literacy\u0026#39 training for Foreign Office staff Dog owners told to feed pet before post arrives and lock them in room for ten minutes after postman has left, under Royal Mail guidanceDonald Trump blasts UK ambassador over leaked memos as aides call for Sir Kim Darroch to be sackedContactless collection plates used in York Minster for the first timeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"geeks become new jocks british universities now have gaming","story":"E-sports have now overtaken football as the sport with the highest number of teams at British universitiesGetting a place on a university sports team used to be a ticket to social prestige. But it appears that geeks have become the new jocks, as British universities now have more competitive gaming teams than any other sport.For the first time there are more students taking part in “e-sports” than football, according to figures compiled and British Universities and College Sport (BUCS) and  National Student E-sports (NSE).E-sports have now overtaken football as the sport with the highest number of teams at British universities. There are 685 e-sports teams spread across 73 universities in the UK, compared to 662 football teams.The next most popular sport is hockey with 546 teams, followed by netball with 432 teams and then Rugby Union with 425 teams.Jon Tilbury, director at NSE which organises inter-university gaming tournaments, said that while university gaming societies have been around for 15 to 20 years, it is only in the past five years or so that they rapidly increased in popularity.Some societies now have hundreds of members, he said, and certain universities have separate societies for particular games.For the first time there are more students taking part in “e-sports” than footballMr Tilbury said that the surge in interest from university students echoes the growth in the gaming industry more generally. “Interest in e-sports has been there for a long time,” Mr Tilbury said. “The wider e-sports community has grown massively, with professional teams paid big salaries and flown around the world to be in tournaments . “What we see is a lot of university students with technical skills getting involved, we have students who have developed their own custom software.”Some universities, which have a particular enthusiasm for gaming, have different societies for particular types of games, for example, Warwick University has a Nintendo Society as well as an E-sports Society. The average university e-sports team consists of 6.5 players, according to data from NSE. Around 90 per cent of players are male, 70 per cent of them are studying courses in STEM subjects.Mr Tilbury explained that inter-university games can be played by students from the comfort of their own bedrooms, but players would meet up in person for the final of a tournament.The NSE co-ordinates with BUCS, the umbrella organisation that organises sports matches, to ensure that gaming matches to do deter students from playing other sports, he added.   The most popular reason students cited for competing in gaming championships was making and maintaining friendships, and improving and becoming a better player, according to a survey by the NSE.NHS pensions: waiting lists soaring as consultants refuse to work overtimeBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullComment: Labour is now a racist party, and the only honourable course of action for members who care is to leave Air pollution could shorten a child\u0026#39s life by up to seven monthsComment: Phil Neville is right: a good effort isn\u0026#39t the same thing as a triumph London commuters urged to turn off Wi-Fi on their phones to avoid having their every move trackedJeremy Hunt challenges Boris Johnson to rule out handing Nicola Sturgeon more tax powersSouth Korean man \u0026#39politely\u0026#39 holds up bank - but it wasn\u0026#39t money or valuables he wantedAmnesty identifies new \u0026#39killing field\u0026#39 in Philippines drugs war ahead of key UN voteChris Grayling accused of trying to \u0026#39silence\u0026#39 road hauliers over no-deal BrexitComment: We must help the young overcome the poverty of hope hanging over their generationMussel shortage warning as study shows noise stunts their growth More than two thirds of millennials believe their generation will be \u0026#39worse off\u0026#39 than their parents’Almost 3,000 suspected child sex offenders released without any conditions to stop them approaching victimsNo major UK politician trusted by public on immigration, poll showsJeremy Hunt champions Christians facing persecution as he pledges \u0026#39religious literacy\u0026#39 training for Foreign Office staff Dog owners told to feed pet before post arrives and lock them in room for ten minutes after postman has left, under Royal Mail guidanceDonald Trump blasts UK ambassador over leaked memos as aides call for Sir Kim Darroch to be sackedContactless collection plates used in York Minster for the first timeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hope prix pictet 2019 photographic competition shortlist selection","story":"The Prix Pictet competition carries a prize of 100,000 Swiss Francs (about £80,700).

There is absolutely a perception among students, echoed by teachers, that getting top grades in languages is difficult and is more difficult than other subjects.”Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, says the status quo is \u0026#34unacceptable\u0026#34He said this is not an unreasonable calculation to make, adding that parents also advise their children against languages on this basis. They are making the same sort of calculation: What is going to enable my child to as successful as possible?What will be the best passport to the next stage?Entries for GCSEs in both French and German have dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent, according to figures compiled by the British Council for its annual language trends report. The report, published earlier this week, showed that in 2014, there were 166,167 entries for French GCSE and 60,362 for German but by 2018, this had dropped to 117,046 and 42,296 respectively.Mr Buchanan said that the status quo is “unacceptable”, adding: “Whether its Ofqual or someone else - unless we do something, languages will die. There won’t be students who want to take them, and over time there won’t be enough teachers to teach them”.This summer is the second year that students have taken revamped GCSE exams in modern foreign languages (MFL).The new courses were part of a package of reforms by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, designed to toughen up syllabuses, make courses more linear, and cut down on the number of students getting A*s.Ofqual, the exam regulator, is currently undertaking a review of the reformed GCSE MFL subjects, which is due to conclude this autumn.It said it is “aware of statistical evidence” that suggests that GCSE MFL subjects may be “more severely graded than many others”.However, the watchdog said that this alone is not necessarily enough to “justify a change to grading standards”.An Ofqual spokesperson said that their research so far suggests that the new GCSEs are “functioning well”, but added that it takes concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects “seriously” and it “continues to look at this issue in detail”.They added: “We are currently conducting a comprehensive review of grading standards in GCSE French, German and Spanish, looking at statistical evidence, contextual data including trends in the numbers taking these subjects and the quality of students’ work, to see if there is compelling case for an adjustment to grading standards in these subjects.”NHS pensions: waiting lists soaring as consultants refuse to work overtimeBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullComment: Labour is now a racist party, and the only honourable course of action for members who care is to leave Air pollution could shorten a child\u0026#39s life by up to seven monthsComment: Phil Neville is right: a good effort isn\u0026#39t the same thing as a triumph London commuters urged to turn off Wi-Fi on their phones to avoid having their every move trackedJeremy Hunt challenges Boris Johnson to rule out handing Nicola Sturgeon more tax powersSouth Korean man \u0026#39politely\u0026#39 holds up bank - but it wasn\u0026#39t money or valuables he wantedAmnesty identifies new \u0026#39killing field\u0026#39 in Philippines drugs war ahead of key UN voteChris Grayling accused of trying to \u0026#39silence\u0026#39 road hauliers over no-deal BrexitMussel shortage warning as study shows noise stunts their growth No major UK politician trusted by public on immigration, poll showsComment: We must help the young overcome the poverty of hope hanging over their generationAlmost 3,000 suspected child sex offenders released without any conditions to stop them approaching victimsJeremy Hunt champions Christians facing persecution as he pledges \u0026#39religious literacy\u0026#39 training for Foreign Office staff More than two thirds of millennials believe their generation will be \u0026#39worse off\u0026#39 than their parents’Dog owners told to feed pet before post arrives and lock them in room for ten minutes after postman has left, under Royal Mail guidanceDonald Trump blasts UK ambassador over leaked memos as aides call for Sir Kim Darroch to be sackedContactless collection plates used in York Minster for the first timeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 8 july 2019","story":"One of the eagles catching a fish.

But the South Korean later admitted he wasn\u0027t interested in plundering the institution\u0027s vaults. Instead, the 40-year-old man has said he faked the heist with the intention of being arrested in order to get medical treatment in prison. The confession meant his plan backfired as police in Daejeon, 90 miles south of Seoul, have only charged him with intimidation. The charge means he is unlikely to be given the custodial sentence that he was seeking. According to police, the man entered a bank in late June wielding a plastic knife and pointed the “weapon” at an employee. Staff have told investigators that they were taken aback when the man, who has not been named, made no demands, stood completely still and merely asked them to call the police. Authorities responding to the call detained the suspect within four minutes. The employees said the suspect’s “police speech and actions” were “strange”, The Korea Herald reported. They added that he made no effort to resist arrest.Police have now confirmed that the man, who is unemployed and lives with his mother, has admitted that he carried out the “robbery” with the intention of being arrested and sent to prison. He has told authorities that he suffers from chronic back pain but does not have enough money to pay for the treatment that he requires. Unemployment has risen sharply in South Korea over the last two years, with the number of people out of work up more than 30 percent since May 2017. The increase has been even more pronounced in the statistics for the nation’s winter months, surging more than 43 percent to 909,000 people unemployed in November 2018 to 1.3 million in February 2019, according to government figures. South Koreans are reimbursed an average of 67 percent of their medical costs by the government, with the elderly and the young exempt from paying medical bills. The South Korean government has announced plans to provide health insurance for every citizen from 2022. However, there are concerns about funding full healthcare as the economy contracts, the population shrinks and fewer young people are entering the workforce at the same time as a growing number of older people require pensions and healthcare. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house.

Not so much to the left as towards the liberal viewpoint on all things.We saw this during the Brexit negotiations, when one civil servant broke cover and told The Sunday Times that the entire civil service was against Brexit and did its best to undermine it.We need a clear out of these time servers, cocooned in their middle-class bubble.HERE’S Alex Morgan, scorer of the goal which knocked our Lionesses out of the World Cup.She annoyed people by miming the act of drinking tea.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games. Do you like whack-a-mole or are you more of an apple bobber, plunging your head into a barrel of cold water to try to bite an elusive Granny Smith Bouncy castles, face-painting, white-elephant stalls, the suggestive-carrots display, guess-the--of-the-sausage-dog or the dreaded bric-a-brac stall: These are the daft indulgences of the British summer. Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop. It’s not a bad definition of Britishness: Have you ever been to a fête Certain rules apply.RULE ONE: At least one lady on the organising committee shall be called Peggy or Alison.RULE TWO: The trestle tables at the tea stall shall wobble alarmingly, but never quite collapse.RULE THREE: The home-made chocolate eclairs shall start to melt in the cakes tent.RULE FOUR: The PA system operated by the master of ceremoniesshall be prey to random bursts of deafening feedback.RULE FIVE: Evenit rains, everyone will totter home happy.Foreigners often find us hard to understand. At present they are baffled that our Government may soon be led by crumpled, grunting Boris Johnson, and that his opponent will be rambling revolutionary Jeremy Corbyn, an OAP who likes shell-suits and municipal manhole covers.Global diplomats and analysts pore over the socio-economic data, the pollsters’ pie charts, the tax statistics and more, and they puzzle.Likewise, they behold the weekly argy-bargy of Prime Minister’s Questions, or the sight of Nigel Farage and his merry MEPs turning their backs on the EU anthem at the opening of the European Parliament, and they are flummoxed. Brexit bamboozles them — “But why do you wish to leave our European Union ” They really don’t get it.My advice to our foreign friends is this: Follow the bunting and get yourself to a neighbourhood summer beano.Visit a fête and you will soon understand the British character. Bloody-minded,  quirky, unassuming, unfazed about politically-correct crazes.Fêtes are a telling combination of romantic tradition and anarchy. No one wants them to be slickly modern.We want our fêtes to be small-c conservative: The canvas marquee to smell as it did  years ago, the skittles lane to be surrounded by no more health and safety paraphernalia than a few straw bales, and at least one of the domestic-produce judges to become squfy after sampling the home-made sloe gins.At our village in Herefordshire it is always my job to supervise the dog show. In the parade ring things iniably unravel. We have had fights and attempted matings .One year a lad aged  about six entered the ring with a Great Dane twice his size. The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps they feel aggrieved by the bad publicity and have decided to pull up the drawbridge to keep us all out today.It doesn’t work like that.Diana, who knew all about public perception and how to deal with the media, would have advised them to counteract the criticism by making sure that Archie’s christening was an event the whole country could enjoy.There would have been no question of the names of godparents being kept secret, or photos of such a big occasion only being released on Harry and Meghan’s carefully controlled Instagram account.Diana would have known that images of a cute baby and his doting parents, with guests all done up to the nines, would take the heat off the negative stories surrounding the Frogmore building work.I’m sure Meghan has been bruised by some of the, frankly, racist and utterly vile comments on social media, as well as the upsetting and ongoing feud with her family — apart from her mum, Doria.Not even Diana would have been able to silence those hideous trolls, but her wise counsel would have stopped the Markle clan from being a thorn in Meghan’s side.Even before the engagement announcement, Diana would have flown over to the USA and entranced Thomas Markle.I have no doubt Diana would have given him a masterclass in dealing with the media.There would have been no clumsy staged paparazzi shots and Thomas Markle would have proudly walked his daughter down the aisle.Diana, would have been on hand with advice about the announcement of baby Archie’s arrival, which was all a bit messy.She would have been a staunch ally to Meghan and helped her navigate the choppy waters of royal protocol, and been a terric sounding board for any worries the new mum might encounter.Diana would have been a cheerleader for Harry and Meghan’s plans to make a dference both here and in Africa and supported their plans to spend half the year in Botswana with baby Archie, albeit with assurances that “Granny Di” could pop over for regular visits.I understand Harry and Meghan want to protect their little boy and allow him to grow up leading as “normal” a le as possible, but they really can’t have it both ways.Either they are private citizens and pay for their own loft extension, or they are royals and have to share the big events in their lives with the rest of the world. Diana would have helped them achieve that balance.It’s a crying shame she isn’t here, but I truly hope Harry and Meghan have a joyful time today and maybe even change their minds and give us all a peek at the celebrations.FIFTY years ago, Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon and the world was in awe.As a ten-year-old watching this “giant leap for mankind” I genuinely believed that we had taken the first small step into the unknown and were boldly going “where no one had gone before”.I did a primary school project on the first manned voyage to Mars, which we reckoned would take place in  –  nothing seemed impossible.In the years before the Moon landing, we watched Star Trek and thought we’d be living that TV series for real.There was to have been a lunar base, and from there we would explore the solar system and eventually the rest of the universe.Of course none of this came to pass, except in our imaginations and sci-fi films.Scientists had the curiosity and the imagination but, sadly, the general public lost interest.After the space shuttle disasters in  and  that killed  crew members, politicians got cold feet and the manned missions were shelved.This loss of le was tragic but, ever since we started exploring space, astronauts have always paid the ultimate price.Even the Apollo  Moon landing came close to disaster.This week sees the release of Armstrong, an astonishing documentary about the first man on the Moon.Watching the footage, you will gain a new-found respect for this rare breed of human beings.Hopefully it will ignite a new passion among this current generation to once again travel into space.If we don’t seek out “new le and new civilisations”, then what are we actually here for THE biggest kid of all in the le of Coleen Rooney would appear to be her husband.She’s ed home with her four boys and left Wayne in the US with a list of strict instructions most mums would leave for their stroppy teenage sons.Wayne has been warned that there is to be no boozing, no wild parties and he has to phone Coleen every day to check in with her so she can be reassured he really is behaving himself.No wonder the poor lass has to have so many holidays.Looking after FIVE boisterous boys must be utterly exhausting.I AM more than a little bit in love with Suranne Jones as “Gentleman Jack”.This cracking drama based on the real-le th century lesbian Anne Lister is witty, wicked and, at times, impossibly sad.Anne was a bold pioneer trying to find her place in le.At a time when women were kept firmly in their place and either treated like imbeciles or fragile pieces of bone china, she was a sharp businesswoman who owned her own land and took no s**t.When it came to matters of the heart, however, Anne was achingly vulnerable and badly let down by the women she loved.It’s the last episode tomorrow but,you have missed out, you can catch up on BBC iPlayer and a second series has already been commissioned.CAROL Vorderman has the sort of figure that would make Jessica Rabbit turn pea green with envy – proper gorgeous, voluptuous curves.She told me it’s all down to doing thousands of squats, walking for miles in the countryside and the side-effects of the menopause.Under that regime, most of us would end up with rock-hard flat buttocks, sore feet and horric night sweats.GAIL Porter famously once had her derrière beamed on to the Houses of Parliament.It actually made a refreshing change to see a backside on the outside of the building, instead of the usual arses who inhabit the interior.Back then, Gail was at the height of her fame as a TV presenter and lads’ mag favourite.It looked as though she was living the dream, but the poor girl was suffering horribly inside.She’s had well documented mental health issues including being diagnosed as bipolar, and suffering with anorexia and anxiety.At one point, in deep despair, she even tried to take her own le.Possibly due to all the stress, Gail’s hair fell out and never grew back.It’s not been an easy road, but I am delighted this irrepressible and beautul woman has bounced back.She’s now in a good place and keen to help others who have been through similar experiences.Gail has teamed up with The Samaritans, an organisation that has helped her in the past, to ask us all to take part in a marathon.The good news is you can take the whole of July to reach  miles.That’s under a mile a day and you can run, jog or walk.Build up your miles in your nearest park, going to work on foot or just out for a stroll.For more information on the Samarathon, see Samaritans.org. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, really.Christine Lagarde, replacing Mario Draghi as European Central Bank president, was a proud cheerleader for Project Fear in her role as head of the International Monetary Fund, predicting the UK’s collapsewe dared vote for Brexit.And Charles Michel, the lame duck Belgium Prime Minister replacing Donald Tusk as EU Council President, has consistently dismissed Brexit as a contemptible little “soap opera”.Come back, Jean-Claude Drunker — all is forgiven!I have seen these appointments described as a “huge headache” for the next British Prime Minister.On the contrary, having an elite of Brexit-bashing, Brit-loathing Eurocrats spitting their federalist poison at us makes leaving the EU inevitable.Nothing is more likely to finally get us out of the European Union than having a sneering, bossy rabble of democracy-denying nonentities wagging their fingers in our faces.I wouldn’t trust the EU Ayatollahs to run a whelk stall.Charles Michel’s major claim to fame is that he became Belgium’s youngest ever PM in , despite his party coming third in the elections.Christine Lagarde was convicted of criminal negligence in  over a financial scandal in France but spared jail time and allowed to keep her job.She is the first female head of the European Central Bank and also the first who has no background in economics.Despite her eight years as head of the IMF, Lagarde is a lawyer and a politician. So best of luck saving the Euro, Christine.Ursula von der Leyen’s nomination as EU Commission President has provoked outrage in her native Germany, where it is perceived as an undeserved reward for miserable failure.Frau von der Leyen’s six years as defence minister earned her the reputation as “the worst minister in Germany” and being promoted to President of the EU Commission is seen as getting “kicked upstairs” by her friend, Chancellor Angela Merkel.Certainly there is nothing on Ursula’s CV to warrant such a promotion.As defence minister, Frau von der Leyen prioritised creches and flexible working hours for Germany’s armed forces.Funding shortages became so dire on her watch that on a Nato training exercise in Norway, German troops were obliged to use broomsticks painted black instead of guns.I don’t fancy her EU army’s chances against the Russians.But I would bet they have childcare facilities to die for.Unelected by the people, unaccountable to the people and contemptuous of the people, this next generation of Eurocrats remind us why the British have no future inside this arrogant empire.Yes, Brexit has been an agony.But the appointment of the EU’s new Ayatollahs prove that remaining is unthinkable.BRIAN JONES, the original Rolling Stone, died  years ago this week.“No Jones, no Stones,” said Bill Wyman. “He formed the band.

Create a separate veterans department for the first time to coordinate their needs across Whitehall, run by a minister who attends Cabinet,. Enshrine the Military Covenant into law to allow vets and bereaved families a way to hold the Government to accountthey suffer disadvantage,. Pass new legislation to end unfair and repeated investigations into historical allegations before the next General Election.The call for the two wannabe Prime Ministers to sign up to the pledge is also backed by ex-Army senior Tory MPs from each of the two men’s campaigns.Writing in The Sun today, ex-Royal Artillery officer Johnny Mercer – a prominent Boris backer – brands it Britain’s “GI Bill moment”, named after the time when America finally decided to do good by its Vietnam War veterans.Mr Mercer adds: “It would be political madness for Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to fail to sign up.”Hunt supporter Richard Benyon, a former Green Jackets officer, said: “The change of leadership is a very important opportunity for us to reboot what Government should be doing to protect our veterans.“The Veterans Pledge is the right way forward.”Previous Governments have, to their credit, taken steps in the right direction.But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to Armed Forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases.They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.Help for Heroes CEO Melanie Waters said: “We have supported over , wounded military personnel and their families so far and the need is growing, which is why we are calling on the leadership candidates to sign up to the Veterans’ Pledge.“Many wounded veterans feel let down by the system and we know more needs to be done by the Government to ensure our heroes get the fair deal they deserve.”Eighteen years of almost constant war fighting since the   terror attacks in areas such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have taken a huge toll on troops.Last year alone, there were , medical discharges from the UK’s Armed Forces,  of them for mental health conditions.It emerged yesterday that almost  vets a day are now seeking help for mental health issues.A recent King’s College London study revealed , former servicemen and women are still suffering from their physical or mental injuries from the modern wars of the past  years.The pledge’s unveiling comes as outgoing PM Theresa May today makes the final speech of her Premiership to the forces to thank them.On a visit to Permanent Joint headquarters, Mrs May will say: “There is no greater responsibility as Prime Minister than ensuring the safety and security of our people.“And doing so is not something any Prime Minister can achieve without you.“You are not just a part of British le – you are the guarantors of British le. The foundation of our freedom. The protectors of our democracy. And for that, we owe you a debt of gratitude.”I have no ties to any particular charity, no agenda in this field — except a point-blank refusal to accept poor care of vet­erans and their families.Make no mistake — Help for Heroes, the Legion, The Soldiers Charity, SSAFA and more deliver world-class services.But there is no doubt they need help. The pathways are still too unclear.Not all charities spend their money in the most effective way.Access to service records remains a nightmare.The Veteran’s transition from military service to a civilian GP is still entirely postcode-driven.The Military Covenant is not applied equally. If a local authority does not believe in it, then it does not apply.Similarly, hundreds dragged through the historical allegations process have no clear support.The new PM must seize the nettle and create a small, dedicated unit in the Cabinet Office.This is our GI Bill moment, a chance to emulate the US treatment of its veterans.Our Government has not led in this sector for too long. In this change of administration, I want a change of attitude. Enough of the warm words and intentions.The Sun and our major care-givers today demand a tangible commitment to do by our veterans our duty we should have done some years ago.It would be political madness for Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to fail to sign up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This week, Justice minister Robert Buckland admitted the government had spent £.m so far on the tendering process. And he added that costs were projected to hit £.m before the process was finished. The bulk of the costs are for the staff and outside advice on how to ‘develop and run’ the competition.And Labour ’s shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said the spending a ‘complete waste of money.’ Mr Burgon said: “The millions wasted on this private prison ‘competition’ should be being put to much better use by investing in crime prevention and on rehabilitation to keep us all safer. “This is a complete waste of money, especially at a time of record cuts to the Ministry of Justice budget. “It really is time to break the hold that the private sector has on the Ministry of Justice. “The government should pull its plans for yet more private prisons. “Labour will put an end to them and to the wheelbarrows of cash being handed over from the Ministry of Justice to failing private sector companies.” The cash will be used to decide who gets to run the new planned private prisons including HMP Glen Parva in Leicestershire and HMP Wellingborough. The public sector is banned from bidding to run any of the new prisons. But experts point to the poor track record of the private sector in running Britain’s jails.

It is far from any car parks - nowhere near any toilets or cafes - and there are no sign posts advertising that it even exists. In a little cove tucked away in the clf-side is a feature unique in Cornwall, and perhaps the world.These stunning images from Cornwall Live offer a glimpse inside the th century en-suite Georgian bathroom, carved into a rock face.Strangely, for such an exceptional feature that is over  years old, it does not seem to have been documented until the end of the  century, and very little has been written about it since.    This is, perhaps, fitting for such a personal space, hidden in a cave on a secluded beach to offer privacy to a Cornish gentleman and his we when they wished to take a bath by the sea. Four metres back into the solid rock of the clf, a narrow tunnel opens out into a small chamber in which there sits a rock-cut bath, roughly one metre deep and always full. It was built at the end of the s for the botanist John Stackhouse, who owned nearby Acton Castle. By the end of the  century, the benefits of bathing in sea water and in spring water were widely recognised by the aristocracy, and as a botanist spending time in the spa town of Bath with a special interest in marine algae, this growing health obsession did not escape the attention of Stackhouse.    After he married Susanna Acton in , John Stackhouse had Acton Castle built above the remote Cornish cove where he found himself spending most of his time, studying seaweed and marine algae.  At some point between  and Stackhouse had two rock-cut baths carved out for him down at the cove. Some say it was because he was suffering from rheumatism, others say that they were for his we, Susanna.   The first bath was a tidal seawater pool, cut into the rock on the beach with steps and a drain to keep the water at a constant level. These outdoor baths cut into rock at beaches can be found where in Cornwall, such as at Portreath, where there are seven of them.    However, the second bath, inside a cave that had been carved out of the clf, with its own constant flow of natural spring water, was unlike anything . Roughly two metres above the beach, the entrance to this peculiar bath resembles an adit to a mine shaft- clearly manmade in appearance, but with bright green moss and algae cascading out of it and down the rocks to the ground. Originally, there were steps cut into the rock, leading up to the entrance, but these have been worn away by the sea over time.   The small tunnel, which is about cm wide and .m high, leads back into total darkness. The only clue of what is at the end is the dripping of the natural bath tap that has been left on for two centuries. Venturing into the tunnel, as daylight fades, the rich greens and reds of the algal biofilms on the rock begin to glow. The floor of the tunnel is carpeted in a wet green moss.     Four metres in, the tunnel opens out into the chamber which is almost entirely taken up by the bath, and has very little light, apart from that coming through the tunnel, and down from a man-made vertical shaft designed to feed the natural spring down into the bath.  The first detailed documentation of Stackhouse’s cave bath is considered to be by Michael Tangye, when he wrote about ‘Rock-cut baths in Cornwall’ in the Cornwall Archaeological Society’s  booklet. In it, he writes: “This remarkable and unique feature lies within the rock clf face at the centre of the cove. Here, several feet above the beach level is a tunnel which at first glance resembles a mine adit outlet.    It appears to have been originally approached by rock-cut steps ascending from the beach on the south side, of which only one, at the top, has survived sea erosion.” Writing about the tunnel into the bath chamber, Tangye continues: “Pick marks can be seen on its walls. This leads into a rock-cut chamber ftsquare and fthigh. In its floor a rectangular bath has been sunk ftlong, ft inswide, and ftdeep.  The vertical shaft that feeds the bath with slightly alkaline spring water is a sophisticated part of the design, and is described by Tangye as such: “In the north-west corner of the roof, a rectangular chimney-like shaft, again cut from the solid rock, ascends some ftto the clf top. Fresh water, from a small stream, drains into this, falls down the shaft, then through a hole in the stone roof of the chamber, ft insby ft ins , and into the bath beneath. The constant overflow drains along the approach tunnel to the exterior.    This fresh water bath, situated within its dark, cold and secluded chamber must have been again created for John Stackhouse and Susanna, his we.”  There have been suggestions that for such a sophisticated natural spring-fed bath system to be built, John Stackhouse would have employed experts from Bath, where he also chose his architect for Acton Castle. However, the local knowledge and skill of tunnelling into clfs in that area was unmatched at the time.  Stackhouse had appointed local man John Carter as caretaker and key holder of Acton Castle, and entrusted him with the property for the long periods when he was not there. But along with his brother, Harry, John Carter was a notorious smuggler, calling himself the ‘King of Prussia’ and creating a maze of smuggler’s tunnels on the south coast.

Gasping at the sight of the ocean, the four-year-old squealed in delight, then sprinted excitedly to the waves. It was the first time Mia had been to the seaside. Like many struggling families in Britain, a holiday by the sea was beyond the reach of her grandmother Linda Cole, who has cared for her since she was a toddler. And despite hearing Mia’s pleas to go to the beach like her nursery friends had, Linda feared she would never be able to afford the gt she most wanted to give her.   But she got to see Mia’s dream come true thanks to the Family Holiday Association , which helps hardworking families give their children the British beach experience that has become an unaffordable luxury for many.Linda, , from Birmingham, said being able to take Mia for a four-night break at Haven’s Devon Clfs Holiday Park in Devon, where they stayed in a caravan, was “unforgettable”. She says: “A lot of her friends had come back from holidays by the sea and she kept asking mewe could go too. I felt sad for her that I wasn’t able to take her. I’ve never seen her so excited, from the moment she found out she was going, to the moment we walked to the beach for the first time. She screamed and said, ‘Wow!’ “Every day she would get up first, eager to go back to the beach. She’d build sandcastles, find shells, play in the waves. “Later we’d go to the arcades and she also loved throwing bread to the seagulls. It was so great to see her enjoying herself and for both of us to create memories together.” Mia says: “It was amazing. What I liked most was jumping in the sea. I want to go back.” Linda took Mia and her three brothers in to live with her when Mia was  months old, as their mother struggled with a heroin problem. The boys later went to live with their father.  Trying to help her wayward daughter while doing what she could to protect and provide for her granddaughter took its toll on the single grandmum. Linda had a heart attack in , which she puts down to the pressure she was under. But she says things are now improving and her daughter has been off drugs for a year. Dedicated to bringing up Mia as well as she can, as well as providing for her other grandchildren, she struggles to get by on £ a week. She said: “I don’t bother about myself and when I need clothes I go to the charity shops. You’re only going to be a child once, so I want to give them the best upbringing they can have. But the budget is really tight and I feel bad when I can’t give them the things they want.    “When Mia askedshe could go to the seaside it broke my heart. I knew it was one of those things I’d never be able to afford for her.” Staff from Mia’s creche, Grendon and Billesley Nursery and Family Centre, put Linda in touch with the Family Holiday Association. As well as providing the free four-night break at the holiday park, the organisation gave the family £ spending money for their trip. Linda said: “It was a lovely caravan. The beach was just a few minutes away and we could hear the waves as we slept. “It was so tranquil and I noticed how Mia became calmer and less agitated while she was there. It was such a restful time for me too, I was able to relax and recharge my batteries, which I really needed. “I’m so grateful for the­ experience.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bid solve mystery childhood allergy","story":"NewsBid to solve mystery of childhood allergy timebomb after HUGE riseNHS Digital statistics show  under tens were admitted to hospital with anaphylactic shock in -, up from  in -ShareCommentsByAmy-Clare Martin:,  JUL NewsNatasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died of an allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe number of children experiencing potentially le-threatening allergic reactions has soared by % in five years, figures reveal.

At Windsor Castle on Saturday everything looked rosy between the Sussexes and Cambridges as the “fab four” got together at the christening of Harry and Meghan’s two-month-old son. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex came under fire for keeping the event private and refusing to name Archie’s godparents.

He would complete four paper rounds a day just to save up the money he needed to buy the cars before fixing them and selling them on.What was once a hobby for the boy born in Thornhill is now the career of a letime. Now Joseph Sullivan is all grown up and the chief executive of Hemmels, in Cardf , a firm that specialises in the restoration of classic post-war Mercedes-Benz sports cars for clients across the globe, reports Wales Online . The cheapest car available costs £, while the most expensive costs an eye-watering £.m.Joseph, , was born in Thornhill and went to Llanishen High School in Cardf, reports Wales Online .At  he won the opportunity to train with the Ministry of Defence as an aeronautical technician. He said he “absolutely hated it” but it taught him discipline and perfection. “I was always into cars and knew it was what I wanted to go into,” he said. “I hated the apprenticeship I had, to be honest, but it taught me a lot about process, which is important, but at that age I just wanted to get back to cars. “I was always helping my dad fix cars and we’d be tearing down motorcycle engines on the kitchen table.”  Joseph’s father is a mechanic by trade and it was through this that he developed a love for fixing cars at a young age. He pulls up in an Aston Martin DB to South Wales Vehicle Solutions in Caerphilly – the garage he opened when he was  with just £,. “The garage was a bit of everything. I did MOTs, car fixing, but I also did a bit of restoration work,” he said. “As time went on I started doing more and more of them and continued to build on my clients. There’s no one moment where I felt like it was le-changing but I knewI wanted to build my brand globally, I needed to move my operations to Cardf. “The garage was so busy and still is but I needed to rebrand.”  Now Joseph runs a state-of-the-art showroom in Penarth Road which he opened five years ago. Here, wealthy clients purchase classic cars in the colours of their choice along with a selection of bespoke options. The popular classic car favourites include the Mercedes SL, SL and SL. The cars are extremely rare and, as a result, highly desirable. Each car is fully dismantled and rebuilt from its bare metal with every little detail done in house. Hemmels even design the carpets of the cars with Joseph’s watchful eye ensuring every detail is checked.  Now they deal with clients as close as Penarth and as far afield as Australia and Hong Kong. He said: “We deal with clients from all across the world – it’s amazing and putting Cardf on the map. It’s amazing when you’re delivering cars to countries like Australia. “One of the craziest things I saw was a client in Hong Kong who had around  to  extremely rare classic cars. He wasn’t flashy – he was a reserved older man who loved his cars, that’s all. “I oversee each part of the process and it does take a while but it has to be perfection. That’s the dference – when someone looks at our cars they can say it’s a Hemmels car. “My working week is something like  to  hours. I’m up at four or five in the morning in the gym and then working till late hours in the evening.

By the time the retired engineer takes his final breath there will be a group of people who will be at his bedside, ready to whirr into action. His family will be by his side, and, depending on the circumstances and location, a nurse or doctor will be nearby. When the Welshman dies, a team of volunteers from all around the UK will descend with haste on his final resting place.If it all goes to plan, they will have been there for days before he dies, swapping work shts and skipping holidays to ensure they don’t miss the pivotal moment, reports Wales Online .   That’s because, for them, the first minutes after death are vital. As soon as the father-of-two is officially declared dead the group will waste no time in putting his body on le support. To the untrained eye it might seem as though the group are trying to revive the Cardf man. Their aim, after all, is to make sure oxygen continues to flow, preventing any irreversible brain damage from taking place. In reality it is the first step in a journey which will continue for dozens,not hundreds, of years – endingand when technology becomes available to reanimate his body once more. Until that time Mike will stay in a cylinder of -C liquid nitrogen thousands of miles away. Welcome to the fascinating world of cryonics – and those willing to take a chance on it. I just googled cryogenics and then eventually came across the term cryonics. Then I found Cryonics UK, Mike explains, absently stroking the ear of the south Asian rescue dog at his side.    I went to a couple of meetings, got in touch with one of cryonics providers in the US, and eventually I thought: aposI don’t think it will work but what have I got to lose apos Ten years ago I would say to you it’s a heck of a long shot. I think now I would say it’s a bit of a long shot. So much has happened in the meantime I think you never know – there’s a chance. For the last  years or so Mike has been a key member of Cryonics UK. A registered charity since , their number is made of up of members of all vocations, ages, and walks of le. Congregating in Yorkshire four times a year, they will meet to refresh their training and prepare for the call-out once someone wishing to be cryonically preserved becomes seriously ill. Mike believes there are about  members but he canapost open the encrypted list of memberships he has been sent to check. While no-one knows what is going to happen in years to come they are all united in their ability to hope.    Cryonics people are as ied as anyone  in society but it’s the only thing you see with them all – they all like le and want more of it and want to see what will happen in the future,” Mike explains. We have people older than me, people in their s. I was an engineer, we have one or two in IT which tends to attract them for some reason...we had a dentist but he is now in Detroit in liquid nitrogen. Sitting in his Thornhill home with his two dogs at his side and a cup of tea in hand, Mike’s tone is conversational and light. His house is comfortable, but not extravagant, and the garden outside is blooming with flowers. In other words, an ordinary place to discuss an extraordinary subject. I think that excites me. If I lived this le and came back and live a similar le again and again I think by about the third time you’d think you’ve seen it, done it.    I don’t think humans as we know them will be around in  years because we’ve got the point where it’s not natural selection anymore – we will be able to select what we want. It will start off, I think, with resistance to disease and then go on to maybe improve intelligence. I wouldn’t mind coming back as something completely dferent that would be able to go out and explore the moons of Jupiter. He breaks off with a self-deprecating laugh: “I know it sounds a bit weird.” Unsurprisingly, attitudes towards cryogenics are mixed. While Mike says he has never had an adverse reaction to telling someone about his plans he is understandably wary before he sits down to talk. Generally he will receive two types of media requests – those seeking to get their head around the concept and those determined to “poke fun” at Cryonics UK and their aims.    Indeed, back in  scrutiny in the press reached a peak when a -year-old terminally ill teenageraposs decision to be cryogenically preserved went to court. Eventually, in the High Court, it was ruled the teenager’s mother, who supported the girl’s decision, should be the only person allowed to make the final call after her father originally contested her wishes. In his judgement Mr Justice Peter Jackson described the organisation that prepared the girl’s body for freezing as “under-equipped” and disorganised. Not that disorganised is a word that I would use to describe Mike. So far the -year-old has taken part in three of the  “real le” cases Cryonics UK have carried out since their inception to prepare the body for long-term storage. On his dining table there is a minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour guidebook detailing the process needed to cool a body down after death and fill it with a type of antreeze to stop crystals forming. Next to it there is a slideshow printout of diagrams and images of the equipment they use from a presentation he once gave to a group of embalmers.    He explains: We want to be there at the bedside when the person actually dies. The big thing is you want to get someone to pronounce or confirm death who is acceptable to the doctor. Every single case it changes. Legally almost any competent adult in the UK can confirm death, particularlyit is a relative. Once we feel confident that they are dead we will put them on the chest compression machine and lung ventilator and start cooling them down.    [Then] we can start to put the medications in to stabilise, to stop blood clotting, stop capillaries from collapsing.” Once a body is stable the volunteers will rush in their second-hand ambulance to a rented mortuary in the area. With no qualied medical staff in their midst, once there they will be joined by an on-call embalmer. It will be their job to cut the veins and arteries in the neck and insert cannulas – allowing the group to perfuse the head with the specialist antreeze. Mike continues: The antreeze penetrates all the cells, all the blood vessels, everything, so at that point we can freeze the person below freezing point.    We actually put them in a specially-insulated box and put dry ice around, solid carbon dioxide, and that actually sublimates at around -C. We take the body down then to -,-C and that takes about three days. At that stage the body will be transported in a cargo plane surrounded by kg of dry ice to the person’s storage facility of choice. On arrival the person is put in what Mike describes as a “Thermos flask” full of liquid nitrogen – head down in case the top begins to boil away. For Mike, like many others, that place is the Alcor Le Extension Foundation in Arizona – after deciding to switch over from another provider.    He said: “Because I had already got a provider and [Alcor] was more expensive I wanted to go there first to seethey were worth the extra. “They won’t take you to the actual storage room for security reasons but because I am involved actively with Cryonics UK and knew the guy who does the visits to people when they are dying...he said aposDon’t worry about the tour, I’ll take you aroundapos. “My we came with me. The rationale was that I was going over for half a day, all the way there, so why don’t we make a holiday out of it  “I might change my mind again. I know someone who has changed their minds two or three times and switched back and for. As of May  Alcoraposs website states that it has  patients stored within its walls. Around the world it has a further , members who will make their journey to be preserved once the time comes. In suggested there were  people cryogenically preserved in America,  in Russia, and a few thousand prospective candidates signed up.    In the wealth of information available on Alcoraposs website they confirm arrangements can also be made to cryopreserve pets while others can make use of the storage available for personal items which will be ed “upon revival”. For Mike the only thing he hasnapost worked out yet is quite how he will fund histo le. While heaposs not bothered about a funeral or memorial service after he dies – I couldnapost care less – the practicalities of leaving money for his future self are proving more tricky. It’s extremely dficult to do, he says. You can’t arrange it in Britain because you can’t really leave money indefinitely. You can apparently leave money for yourself in trust but only for  years or something like that, which might be long enough but it might not, so we’ll say it’s a working process. You could be reanimated and destitute – who knows  It turns out the subject of money is one the members of Cryonics UK are keen to discuss. Mike tells me one of the biggest misconceptions is that cryonics is only available for the super-rich or famous – Simon Cowell is said to be on the list to be preservedhe dies.    On the other end of the scale, however, members of Cryonics UK often turn to le insurance made over to the storage provider to afford the sums needed. Not that itaposs particularly cheap though. There are arrangements ranging from , and , for full body storage. There is also an option to store your head only for , – something Mike considers a little ghoulish. Over in the Cryonics Institute in Michigan prices range between , and ,. But thereaposs a dference – while Alcor will pay Cryonics UK for preparing, freezing and transporting the body on their behalf,youaposre registered with the Cryonics Institute the £, bill will be added on top. If you are not already a member of Cryonics UK, which costs £ a month, then that will cost a further £, in late membership fees. Mike, who would rather not reveal how he has paid for his storage, explains: In Cryonics UK there isn’t one person you would call rich. There are a few people who are like I am here, comfortably off, but there are people who are not quite comfortably off even. It costs quite a bit of money but people take it out with le insurance so you are talking about something that is affordable for quite a lot of people.    Take fellow Cryonics UK member Tim Gibson for example. His involvement with cryonics started aged  although his interest in the field dates even further back. By the time he was in college he was paying his £. a month le insurance to make his ambitions possible. Now he pays £ a month after swapping his policy for a better deal. Speaking in a spare half hour between jobs he said: When you are young and you realise that people die that’s terrying. Maybe some people don’t think that but I certainly did. It went from there. I went through a lot of stupid ideas that were impossible...but that set me up. I latched on to [cryonics] – I just fancied the idea and it was easy from there. From speaking to Tim you get the sense that it is those still living that present the real complications compared to those already frozen. Most of all you are reliant on the person themselves being organised. Getting a spot at a storage facility takes a lot of paperwork, as does organising the le insurance to pay for it. Then family members must be made aware of their wishes , or a solicitor or charity member appointed next of kin to allow the process to happen. After all Tim estimates that while there are roughly  members of Cryonics UK there may be up to three times that amount of people in the UK signed up to a storage facility – some possibly with no idea how they will get there. Before our arrival Mike had printed out two A pages explaining his thinking and rationale behind joining the world of cryonics. Here is just some of what he wrote. From the age of about  I decided that, despite what was drummed into me at school, there was no evidence for either a god or an immortal soul. My conclusion was therefore that, from an inidual perspective, death was followed by oblivion. I found this deeply upsetting and could only take consolation at that time that at least death would probably be quite some time in the future. Nevertheless I did wonder, over the years, whether it might be possible to preserve my body in some way, probably by freezing it until such a time that technology would have progressed to the point where it could be brought back to le and rejuvenated, with my memories and personality intact. Will all this be for better or worse  Who knows, and many people fear the unknown but for me there is no reason to fear. When I was a young man I did not know what le would serve for me and that was exciting. As I got older options steadily closed so future possibilities, whilst still uncertain, were much more restrained. This, to me, is somewhat sad, so the idea of a future of inconceivable changes gives me a compelling reason to want to experience the future, whatever it is and whatever form I might take.   Tim explains: A lot of people sign up for the storage element but that’s it. The more domestic equivalent is buying a plane ticket but not having the money to get to the airport. The other thing you have to worry about is the place of death for someone wishing to be preserved. I am told care homes are better than hospitals, due to the privacy afforded and facilities in place, and that attitudes of hospitals can y. He adds: In some hospitals you can come and sit in the waiting room and bring the kit in. Others say they will bring people to the back door – it just depends. They would prefer you not [to prepare the body] there because of their insurance risk and it depends on the time of day. One hospital gave us quite strict requirements but when the person was facing their last hour it was four in the morning. The hospital just said to bring everything in. Finally you have the procedure itself. While doctors benefit from hundreds of past medical notes and historic cases on the operations they attempt Cryonics UK do not have the same luxury. Most members can count on one hand the number of procedures they have carried out – often with dferent combinations of volunteers and at dferent times. Not that they allow that to daunt them.    One of the insecurities that hospitals have is that we don’t have all the safeguards and the fact we don’t have a plan for in case this or that happens, Tim says. Hospitals are supported by decades of patients – how are we supposed to have a complete database of scenarios  We have an idea of what can go wrong and what we are entitled to and not entitled to do. I was told once one of the best volunteers was not a medic but a professional golfer because she was able to make decisions, work independently, and just do it. You come up with a solution. Unlike Mike, Tim is a little less private about his personal le. A student landlord in Sheffield, he is  years old – but stresses that he doesnapost want to give the impression that cryonics is just for the middle-aged. When asked what his family think about his planshe asks his daughter sat in the car with him. Her reaction is that itaposs pretty cool. My we just doesn’t care, she’s not bothered, he continues. The most resistance I got was from my dad who would say it’s immoral, he would say it’s against nature. I think I managed to get him to cooperate by saying: ‘Don’t I at least get to have my own choice about what I want to do apos That was the key.

MPs joined the call for terms to be staggered as a Mirror probe revealed the cost of a holiday can rocket by over £, in August. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: “It’s not right that kids’ education is being used to exploit hard-working parents.” A government shake-up of the school holiday system is being demanded with families paying up to % more for sunshine breaks once kids are on leave. The Mirror found the great summer holiday rip-off will yet again burn a massive hole in family budgets as prices can rise by more than £, in August, compared with early July when children are still in class.    Cross party politicians and family organisations want an end to the sky high prices that hammer millions of hard working Brits who save up for their only sunshine break of the year with the family. The travel industry yesterday defended the rocketing costs of the foreign package breaks and also called for the Government to re-draw the school timetable and stagger holidays. Teaching unions said school attendance is vital for children and instead said the Government should focus on the travel companies. Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner criticised so - cal led “dynamic pricing” for penalising parents.    She told the Mirror: “Eye-watering, rip off holiday prices mean many families choose to take their kids out of school or simply don’t get a break at all. “It’s not right that children’s education is being used to exploit hard-working parents in this way.” Conservative MP Steve Double is campaigning on the issue and fighting the Government’s strict policy that fines parents who take children out of school for a sunshine trip abroad as it is the only affordable option. Department for Education figures show the number of penalty notices for pupil absence has rocketed by % year-on-year with unauthorised family holiday absence accounting for .% of the cases. Between -, parents were fined £ million for taking kids out of school without permission with fines ranging from £ to £ for those not coughing up within  days. His stand comes as Mirror research found a family of two adults and two children aged  and seven can expect to pay £, for a self catering holiday to Marmaris, Turkey heading out of Gatwick on July  for two weeks.    By comparison, the same apartment at Club Anastasia in the same location from the same airport with the same holiday company Thomas Cook costs a whopping £, when flying out on August  - a rise of %. And a family of four planning a two week self catering trip to Zante, Greece faces the temptation of taking the break in term time as a fortnight at Alykes Garden Village, Alykes costs £,. from July - compared with a % hike to £,. from August - when flying out of Liverpool John Lennon Airport with Tui. A spokesperson for industry body ABTA said: “If school holiday dates were staggered, this would help to alleviate sharp peaks and spread demand over a longer period of time.” Travel firm Thomas Cook added: “We have suggested and are supportive of staggered school holiday dates by region to help reduce the pressures of peak holiday demand.” Single parents’ group Gingerbread said solo mums and dads were hit with a double whammy of soaring prices and missing out on family deals aimed at two adults with kids.    Head of membership Anita Naik called for holidays to be tailored to meet the needs of dferent family groups and said: “We all know that the price of holidays shoots up when the school term ends, meaning many families simply can’t afford to go away. “This is compounded for single parents, as not only is there a price hike but any deals offered by holiday companies typically apply to a family with two adults. “One in four families in the UK is headed by a single parent and excluding them from holiday deals simply isn’t fair. Not only does this penalise single parents and their children but it’s also short sighted on the part of holiday companies. “Holiday companies need to wake up, catch up and offer deals that are available to all types of families.” Mr Double said the number of parents fined in his St Austell and Newquay constituency has soared from just four in - to  in - and he slated the fines. He said: “We have a situation where parents who, for perfectly legitimate reasons, are unable to take a family holiday during the school holiday period are subject to an arbitrary tax imposed by the local authority for taking their children out of school.” COMPARE THE MARKET     Thomas Cook AIRPORT: London Gatwick Destination: Club Anastasia , Marmaris, Turkey, self-catering Dates: July - Cost: £, Dates: August - Cost: £, DIFFERENCE: £, Thomas Cook Airport: Newcastle International Destination: Sunwing Resort Fanabe with Siam Park , Costa Adeje, Tenere, all inclusive Dates: July - Cost: £, Dates: August - Cost: £, DIFFERENCE: £ Thomas Cook Airport: London Gatwick Destination: Oasis Park , Costa Dorada, Spain, all inclusive Dates: July - Cost: £, Dates: August - Cost: £, DIFFERENCE: £ TUI Airport: Liverpool John Lennon Destination: Alykes Garden Village , Alykes, Zante, Greece, self-catering Dates: July - Cost: £,.

Christine Noddings and Shirley-Anne Gray had both booked rooms at Central House, Cheltenham, to attend the funeral of a friend. However the pair of -year-olds were both shocked when they were told on the night they arrived from Essex they had to go where.Upon arrival they were told the upgrade was a three-bedroom house just aposten minutes down the roadapos, reports Gloucestershire Live.   Mrs Noddings said: We went inside and found that it was not the kind of place we wanted to stay, particularly since it only had one bathroom. Ms Gray and Mrs Noddings have to have their own bathrooms for ious reasons. God knows what the rooms at the Central Hotel were likewe had been ‘upgraded’, added Ms Gray. After the pair complained they said they were sent to another address - which turned out to be a house with people in. Ms Gray added: At this point we felt that we had been conned - not a good feeling I can tell you at  o’clock at night.      Mrs Noddings said: By this time, we were crying.  It was very dark, very wet and we had been on the road a long time and just wanted to go to bed. We were tired, we were worried and we were fed up. They ed to Central Hotel to demand their actual rooms, a refund and an explanation.    The hotel staff admitted to getting the address wrong. The women were reportedly told again that they had received an aposupgradeapos and that there was nothing that could be done. So, the pair set off again, now to another house in Gloucester Road. When they finally got to the accommodation it was pm, a full two hours after arriving at the hotel and six-and-a-half hours after setting off from home. The two women discovered that the apartment was up three flights of stairs and that they would have to heave all their luggage up there.    The next day, the exhausted women were late to the funeral by  minutes. The two women had worked together with their late friend  years ago in admin, so this was an emotional time for them, they said Central Hotel were dismissive of the womenaposs complaints by email, said the pair.  A manager emailed them: I am sorry to hear you were unhappy with your upgrade however we had upgraded you as a good will gesture and the reason behind this is because usually when we upgrade our guests we have outstanding reviews because of this. Unfortunately in these circumstances, I would like to apologise that you were unsatisfied with your upgrade. The manager added thatthe women had rung the -hour help line their query would have been answered and they would have found the correct address. Their request of a refund was refused. Booking initially offered the pair £ in compensation but later changed its stance. Mrs Noddings said: The £ was an insult to be honest.

Prince Edward gets a new title Now this is an unexpected development.  Prince Edward, aka the Earl of Wessex, is one of the more low-key royals and he was not given a dukedom when he got married to Sophie. The couple also decided against their kids being styled His or Her Royal Highness, but instead had them styled as the children of an Earl.However, Edward not getting a ducal title wasnapost a snub - itaposs because itaposs believed heaposll be created Duke of Edinburgh after both Charles’s accession and Prince Philip’s death, PopSugar reports.. What on earth will Camilla be called  Will Camilla be Queen Consort  A lot of the British public donapost feel positively about that.    Interestingly, Charles wonapost be the first monarch to have to solve the conundrum about what to title their spouse. Back at the start of the Queenaposs reign, the Duke of Edinburgh went through a period of not actually having a title. He was an HRH, but not a Prince. Heaposs been the Duke of Edinburgh since , but heaposs not a Prince Consort like Prince Albert was. Keeping up  No, us neither.  With Camilla and Charlesapos complex romantic history, the question of what sheaposll be titled remains unanswered. Technically she is the Princess of Wales at the moment, but has never used that title . So would she go with the title of Queen Consort  Watch this space... Essentially, what all of this demonstrates is how bizarre and complicated being a royal is. . Thereaposs a new Prince of Wales Another downside of being royal is,you want a promotion, someone has to pop their clogs first. This is not an HR problem the rest of us have .  So, the Queen dies, Charles becomes king and that means thereaposs a job opening for the position of the Prince of Wales. As Charlesapos heir to the throne, this goes to William, who will also become the Duke of Cornwall, the Duke of Rothesay and heir apparent. .  Kate can finally be called a Princess This is a funny one, because for so many of us Diana is absolutely synonymous with the title of Princess of Wales - hence Camilla not using it.

The other gore victims were described as a -year-old Calornian, who suffered a superficial neck wound, and a -year-old from the northern Spanish province of La Rioja also gored in the left leg. An -year-old from the Basque city of San Sebastian and a -year-old from Barcelona were also taken to hospital with head wounds. Although their condition is not said to be serious, hospital staff said one was rushed from the scene unconscious and only awoke in the ambulance.

Another became separated from the rest of the pack towards the end and was last to be ushered into pens after completing the run, in two minutes  seconds and around half a minute after the other animals. A spokesman for Pamplona’s Hospital Complex initially said they had received only one man who had been gored, in his left leg, confirming another two patients had been brought to the hospital with head injuries.

Raising money for charity is one of the things my company does as a way of giving something back to the community.“This isn’t the first long distance bike ride I have completed.“I have previously cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats with the money I raised going to a charity in Edinburgh named The Yard which raises cash for adventure playgrounds for disabled children.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car -

region are being encouraged to recognise some of the great work going on in their schools by sharing their experiences and photos using the #ilovemyschool hashtag.Speaking to the Evening Express, Portlethen Academy pupil Abbie Johnson said her history teacher Mrs Ferguson went “above and beyond” for her.The -year-old said: “My history teacher Mrs Ferguson really changed how I saw school because I was bullied physically, verbally and on social media.“I’ve always had severe anxiety and that started with coming to school and getting on the bus.“She really helped my confidence in my school work because I’m not at all confident and she went above and beyond.“She spent her own money on little things to help like stress toys and took me out of class to talk and she just completely put herself into helping me as a person and not just as a pupil.“She made learning interesting, fun and a relaxed environment.“And for me getting as anxious as I do, it was important that I was comfortable. If you cried she was there with a shoulder to cry on. She was more of a friend than a teacher and she is just such an amazing person.”And Abbie Noon, , from Mearns Academy, also had a teacher who supported her when she was bullied.She said she found it dficult to deal with some children at the school.She said: “There was an RME teacher Mrs McGillivray. She always made me feel better. She was very inclusive of everybody.“It was always hard because my bullies were in my religious class and she saw how I felt.“She always made me feel like I had somebody to speak toI needed to.”The campaign has been set up by the council to remind teachers and those looking for employment in the education sector just how important the role is.Parents, teachers, staff and members of the public can all take part by telling their story about an inspirational teacher.Fth year Westhill Academy pupil Chloe Davidson said her biology teacher Miss Docherty helped support her through anxiety.She said: “She was so helpful. If there were things I couldn’t do, like group talks, she would make sure nobody  knew that I was struggling.“She would give me something  to do and make it look like it was a totally normal thing.“So now that I’m in fth year, she still looks out for me and makes sure that we’re all feeling particularly comfortable in our class.“She’s so positive and so enthusiastic about the things she teaches, it’s not just like she’s reading from a slide.“She’s very interested in the things she’s teaching.”Laurence Findlay, director of children’s services at Aberdeenshire Council, is keen to recognise the dference each and every good teacher can make.He said: “At the end of another challenging year, I can’t thank all of our teachers and support staff across Aberdeenshire enough.“Most of us can recall at least one teacher or important person in our lives who inspired us, one whom we felt really believed in us or one who gave us that nudge we needed at the time we needed it.“Teachers and the schools that support them really do change lives.“All too often we’re caught up in what we don’t get right but there’s so much that we do.“This is about sharing that and marking the importance of such a worthwhile profession.”Councillor Gillian Owen, chairwoman of the education and children’s services committee, lives in Ellon and enjoys visiting local schools to see how they are getting on.She said: “It’s always an absolute pleasure to visit my local schools.“It’s one thing reading about the theory through committee papers and another to see for myself just how much is being achieved within each and every school setting.“I’m absolutely an advocate for this #ilovemyschool campaign and I hope that every teacher, whether they voice it or not this week, takes the time to reflect on what they’ve achieved just being there for these young people.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/5d01e87f59b296.55403871.jpg ","title":"revealed aberdeens favourite most visited oor wullie sculptures","story":"A sculpture honouring one of the north-east’s greatest sporting heroes is proving to be one the most popular attraction in a charity art trail.Oor Wullie Miller, one of the statues created as part of Oor Wullie’s BIG Bucket Trail in support of children’s hospital charities around Scotland including the ARCHIE Foundation, has been voted the best in Aberdeen.The sculpture was created in recognition of Aberdeen FC hero Willie Miller, .Thousands of people using the accompanying smartphone app to track their progress have had their say, voting for their favourite sculptures as they go.The statue honouring the European Cup Winners’ Cup-winning Dons skipper, which was created by artist Sarah Mauchline, sits outside the Bon Accord shopping centre and is currently out in front with a total of  votes.Map: Here are the locations of all  Oor Wullie sculptures in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local map-here-are-the-locations-of-all--oor-wullie-sculptures-in-aberdeen-and-aberdeenshire embed # secretECzCuK\" data-secret\"ECzCuK\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Willie, who played  times for the Pittodrie side, said: “I am glad people are taking to the statue, but the most important thing is the charities do well.“I’ve seen quite a lot of the statues throughout Scotland and I think the job they are doing is the important thing.“I am delighted the people passing mine have taken to it.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Training up more drone pilots means the Mountain Rescue service now has greater capacity to assist in rescues all over Scotland.Drones are increasingly used in searches for people missing in the mountains but the service is also looking at innovations, such as using them as communication hubs in areas where therersquos poor or no signals.Dave Wright, Team Leader at Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue, said: ldquoAs a volunteer service the Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue team are totally reliant on the support of both the iniduals who give up their time but also to companies like Openreach who support volunteering.ldquoWithout the dedication of our volunteers and the backing of their employers we would not be able to provide this vital emergency service in our community.Openreach is one of the UKrsquos biggest employers of veterans and reservists, with around , in total and more than , ex-service personnel recruited since .It has nearly  active reservists, around  of whom are also part of the British Armyrsquos  Signal Squadron."},{"url":null,"title":"wake-me-up-before-you-go-go-to-hawick","story":"FANS of George Michael and Wham! are in for a treat next week.The George Michael Story is coming to Hawick Town Hall.With a live band and video screens supporting the show, including video footage of George and interviews with the man himself, The George Michael Story starts with George in the Wham! days in the early s and moves onto the Grammy Award-winning Faith -

on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

Finally, it cuts the lettuce from the rest of the plant without crushing it so that it is ldquosupermarket-ready.Co-author Josie Hughes said: ldquoFor a human, the entire process takes a couple of seconds, but itrsquos a really challenging problem for a robot.The Vegebot has two main components: a computer vision system and a cutting system.The overhead camera on the Vegebot takes an image of the lettuce field and first identies all the lettuces in the image, and then, for each lettuce, classies whether it should be harvested or not.--The Vegebot has two main components: a computer vision system and a cutting system --A lettuce might be rejected because it is not yet mature, or it might have a disease that could spread to other lettuces in the harvest.The researchers developed and trained a machine-learning algorithm on example images of lettuces.Once the Vegebot could recognise healthy lettuces in the lab, it was then trained in the field, in a iety of weather conditions, on thousands of real lettuces.A second camera on the Vegebot is positioned near the cutting blade, and helps ensure a smooth cut.The researchers were also able to adjust the pressure in the robotrsquos gripping arm so that it held the lettuce firmly enough not to drop it, but not so firm as to crush it.The force of the grip can be adjusted for other crops.ldquoWersquove still got to speed our Vegebot up to the point where it could compete with a human, but we think robots have lots of potential in agri-tech, said Ms Hughes.Co-author Julia Cai said: ldquoAt the moment, harvesting is the only part of the lettuce le cycle that is done manually, and itrsquos very physically demanding.In future, robotic harvesters could help address problems with labour shortages in agriculture, and could also help reduce food waste by being trained to pick only ripe vegetables..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Tip of the iceberg  New Vegebot could help plug

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt.

It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll.

It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Women are in line for an average payment of pound,.However, the disputed pay structure is still in place and the GMB, which represents many of the staff, is helping female workers put in a new wave of claims.Smithrsquos GMB union was criticised in previous years for not doing enough to help the female workers, but his appointment in  led to a rethink and his colleagues have since vigorously represented the women.Speaking to the Herald on Sunday, Smith said the poundm may only be the beginning for the council:ldquoThe women are still being discriminated against in Glasgow because there is not a new pay and grading structure in place. For every second these women are at work they are losing out.ldquoAs new people are employed by the council, as soon as they start, many of them are going to have claims against the council as well. The council is paying out pound-plus million, and it is immediately racking up the credit card bill again.He put a figure on what the new bill may come to: ldquoBy  the city council will need to find at least another pound million to fully settle its historic sex discrimination against its employees and it will need to implement a new job evaluation system to address that discrimination once and for all.Smith is worried that Glasgow may fail to pay its bills: ldquoI donrsquot know, in real terms,cities can go bankrupt in the UK, but to all intents and purposes Glasgow is going to run out of money. If you want to call that bankruptcy, fine.\"At some point, the Scottish Government is going to have to step in. You cannot keep remortgaging all the buildings in Glasgow. You canrsquot keep cutting services.\"ldquoThere is a precedent for cities going bust where in the world. I donrsquot think you can let Scotlandrsquos biggest city go bankrupt, but something has got to be done to reverse the decline of Glasgow and, once and for all, sort out the debts.The SNP currently runs the council, but Smith says the political blame predates Nationalist control: ldquoYou have got an administration now that is dealing with generations of mismanagement. You cannot heap all the blame on the current political administration, but there is no easy way out of this.However, he is angry that council officials who he regards as responsible for past mistakes are still in post.ldquoOn the face of it, it feels like the people who were there when we got into this mess are still there now. And that is pretty staggering, he said.Aitken added: ldquoUntil we implement a new pay scheme, there will be further equal pay claims to settle. Everybody knows that ndash it was in the paper we took to committee. We are factoring this into our funding strategy. However, the claims will be smaller in number and they will also cover a far shorter period."},{"url":null,"title":"science-fiction-become-science-fact","story":"Itrsquos the th anniversary of George Orwellrsquos Nineteen Eighty-Four ndash a book which predicted so much of the darker side of modern le. Here Writer at Large Neil Mackay looks at how science fiction has often become science factBIG Brother, thoughtcrime, Newspeak, the two minutes hate. When George Orwellrsquos Nineteen Eighty-Four was published  years ago this summer his terrying fictional vision of a totalitarian future was just that ndash fiction. Today, though, the book, which Orwell wrote in the last months of his le on the Isle of Jura, has become frighteningly true.Orwell was able to predict with chilling prescience the future in which we now live ndash just as so many writers and film-makers have, from EM Forster foretelling the internet to Star Trek envisioning mobile phones. Once a writer imagines the future, itrsquos not long before scientists, politicians or society at large turns it into a reality.Big Brother and ... the telescreenOrwellrsquos most chillingly accurate prophesy was the telescreen ndash a combined TV, security camera and listening device in the home of every citizen. From CCTV and facial recognition technology to the Alexa Amazon device and big data, modern society has accepted almost unquestioningly the right of the state to observe us and companies to harvest information about us. Itrsquos hardly surprising that one of the most popular reality TV shows called itself Big Brother ndash and pandered to our voyeuristic desire to watch and control others.Big Brother was, of course, the dictator who ran the Britain of Nineteen Eighty-Four ndash where poster warned ldquoBig Brother is Watching You.The two minutes hate and thoughtcrimeEvery day, citizens in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four gather to unleash two minutes of hate against perceived enemies of the state who have committed the offence of thoughtcrime ndash of thinking ideas they should not have been thinking. Offenders are rounded up by the thought police.It sounds very like a social media storm where unlucky victims are pilloried for daring to say something deemed offensive. Think of the actor Matt Damon who said this during the height of the MeToo movement: ldquoTherersquos a dference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldnrsquot be conflated. His words, though true, were subject to outrage.NewspeakIn , language is twisted and manipulated by the state to control the people. So a concentration camp becomes a ldquojoycamp, the Ministry of Truth is really the Ministry of Propaganda. Politicians today use their own form of Newspeak to befuddle the people and twist reality ndash think of phrases like ldquocollateral damage to describe civilian casualties of war.The Machine Stops and ... the internetThe Machine Stops was written by EM Forster in . In the tale, obese humans live underground dependent on ldquothe machine ndash which provides for all needs and entertainment. Humans speak to each other via a kind of text messaging and internet service within the machine.Humans barely move or interact ndash no-one cares about the natural world. In the end, the machine stops and what passes for ldquocivilisation stops with it.Minority Report and ... personalised advertsYou know how creepy it is when yoursquove browsed some book online and then adverts for the same product pop up everywhere you look on the web  Welcome to Minority Report.In the  film, inspired by a Philip K Dick story, technology has advanced so far that it can predict crimes yet to be committed. Businesses can scan a personrsquos mind and display bespoke adverts on billboards just for them. Today, General Motors has already created billboards that change according to the car you are driving.Minority Report also saw Tom Cruise using touch screens ndash pinching, pulling and swiping ndash long before such technology was a reality.Star Trek and ... pretty much everythingldquoEnterprise, this is Captain Kirk, come in Enterprise.On Star Trek, crew members have a communicator ndash a clever little gizmo that fits snuggly in your hand and lets you talk to anyone, anywhere. Itrsquos also a GPS device. Pretty much your prototype mobile phone in the s. Star Trek also had a ldquoreplicator ndash technology that could build anything you wanted. In effect, creator Gene Roddenberry was predicting the D printer.If thatrsquos not enough future predictions, Star Trek also imagined the iPad. Programme-makers even called it a PADD or personal access display device. Creepily prescient. Other predictions in Star Trek include Bluetooth ndash remember Uhurursquos big earpiece  ndash Google Glasses and virtual medical diagnoses.Blade Runner and ... the rise of ChinaThe Los Angeles of the future seen in Ridley Scottrsquos  movie looks like a Chinese supercity of today ndash ironically, the film was set in the year . In the movie, Chinese and Asian culture is on the rise. Adverts feature Chinese goods and celebrities . LA residents speak a mix of English and Asian languages. Today, Mandarin is predicted by many linguists to overtake English as the international language one day.Blade Runner, like a number of other movies including Total Recall, also envisions a future where space has been privatised. Companies like Elon Muskrsquos SpaceX are currently trying to carve up the cosmos for corporations ndash something which would have horried Philip K Dick, who wrote the short story Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep  which inspired the movie.AI and ... robotsSteven Spielbergrsquos  futuristic fairytale AI delves into a world populated by androids, almost indistinguishable from humans. In AI, robots are used to serve humanityrsquos baser instincts. They are killed for sport, and exploited for sex. Current inventions such as the sex robot took Spielbergrsquos dark fictional vision and turned it into fact.Robots first appeared in the acclaimed Czech play Rossumrsquos Universal Robots by Karel Capek. The play captures all the concerns we still have today about robotics and AI. At first, Capekrsquos robots are happy slaves, but they rebel and destroy the human race. Today, scientists debate the threat of the ldquosingularity ndash when robot intelligence surpasses human intelligence and humanity risks being sidelined or even eliminated, as Stephen Hawking warned. Think Arnold Schwarzenegger and Terminator and you get the picture.The Handmaidrsquos Tale and ... womenrsquos rightsWe once thought of Margaret Atwoodrsquos acclaimed  dystopian novel as a warning of a future that may come to pass, not a prophesy of a future that would come to pass. However, the assaults on womenrsquos rights around the world feel more like The Handmaidrsquos Tale every day.Just a week ago, an Alabama woman faced criminal charges after being shot and losing her baby. Ohio wants to effectively ban nearly all abortions. In The Handmaidrsquos Tale, religious extremists run rampant across America, calling the shots. Today, fundamentalists in the USA have never before had so much clout.Brave New World and ... medicineIn Aldous Huxleyrsquos  novel Brave New World, the drug Soma is used to keep the population calm and happy. Today, some four million people in the UK are long-term users of anti-depressants.Huxley also imagined a future where embryos are cloned and genetically modied ndash a prophecy of our ethical concerns today, including the danger of ldquodesigner babies following the decoding of the human genome. When the clone Dolly the Sheep was ldquoinvented in Scotland many spoke of the coming of a ldquoBrave New World.The book also envisions a world where movies have become ldquofeelies ndash with the audience physically immersed in the film. With the coming of virtual reality, ldquogoing to the feelies may soon be a common phrase.The Running Man and ... reality TVBased on a Stephen King story, the film The Running Man sees Arnie forced to compete in a reality TV show where he is hunted and faced with being killed for the entertainment of viewers. We havenrsquot quite got there yet, but the excesses of reality TV where unimaginable back in .Today, wersquove got reality shows such as Naked and Afraid which sees contestants stranded stark naked in the rainforest, surrounded by predators, and left to survive with nothing but a kne and a fire-starter. The extreme emotional and mental humiliation heaped on contestants in other shows like Big Brother is also, self-evidently, a cruel sport meant to entertain us.The Six Million Dollar Man and ... bionicsldquoSteve Austin, astronaut.

Austin was horribly injured and given a robotic eye and arm, and bionic legs.Today, prosthetic, robotised limbs are no longer the stuff of science fiction and have changed the lives of those who have suffered le-altering injuries.Snow Crash and ...

From the movie The Martian to the docu-drama series Mars, it seems the human imagination has never been so fixated on the idea of stepping foot on to the Red Planet.There are plans for a US mission to Mars sometime around  ndash so within  years we could see yet another idea which first began with a prediction on the page or on the screen becoming a reality.Star Wars and ... the hologramldquoHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

The primary focus was on the impacts on staffing and the specic impacts depending on timing.The secret codename was first mentioned in the Parliamentrsquos online papers in  when LG agreed to set up a ldquoresilience board for ldquodisruptive incidents.Parliament proposed that the ldquosignicant incidents should include Holyroods role in London Bridge and Unicorn, without specying what the latter meant.It is understood thatthe Queen dies in Scotland - she spends around three months a year at Balmoral - the Parliament, the neighbouring Palace of Holyroodhouse, and St Gilesrsquo Cathedral will be the main focal points.If the Monarch dies when the Parliament is sitting, chamber and committee business will be suspended and the funeral will take place around ten days after her death.It is believed that up to six parliamentary days could be lost, but there will be thirty six hours to prepare for a motion of condolence in the chamber.One of the major challenges facing the Parliament is coping with the huge number of people who are expected to want to sign a condolence book at Holyrood.If the Queen passes away in Scotland, her body will rest at Holyroodhouse, following which her coffin will be carried to the cathedral on the Royal Mile.At this point, her body will be placed on the Royal Train at Waverley station for a journey down the east coast mainline.Passing references have been made to Operation Unicorn in NHS board papers, but with no explanation for what it is.Transport for Edinburgh , which manages the Capitalrsquos bus and tram network, is expected to have an important role in the days after the Queenrsquos death.According to a TfL report, the transport body was last year given delegated authority for the coordination of the Edinburgh council side of Unicorn and other sensitive operations.It noted that TfL had secured ldquolong term resources for these tasks, including police and army personnel, as well as ldquopro bono support from a firm called Inverroy Crisis Management.A newspaper reported last year that civic leaders in Scotland had taken part in a summit on Operation London Bridge.ldquoIt was a provostrsquos association meeting, one participant was quoted saying. ldquoWe were getting briefed on a very sensitive issue that we canrsquot say anything about.

An equal pay dispute, which pre-dates the years of austerity, also placed additional burdens on budgets, and thoroughfares such as Sauchiehall Street and Argyll Street are regarded as eyesores.It was also reported that , rat infestation complaints had been made and last week it emerged that Glasgowrsquos homes had been visited more than , times by pest control staff over the past  months.However, the councilrsquos defenders say that the cityrsquos educational outcomes are healthy and that many of the local authoritys outcomes are positive.Smith, whose union represents thousands of council staff, is a critic of the way the city has been run over the years.Labour, to which his trade union is affiliated, ran the local authority for decades, but was dumped from office by the Nationalists in .The union leader, who moved back to Scotland after living and working in the south of England, lashed out at what he regards as Glasgowrsquos crumbling public sphere.He said: ldquoIt feels like a city that is in decline. Wersquove got public buildings in a state of decay - the Mitchell Library, the problems with the Peoplersquos Palace - the streets are absolutely filthy and wersquove got an epidemic of rats in large parts of the city.ldquoToo often the politicians are happy to hide behind this bluff and bluster about lsquopeople make Glasgowrsquo. The people of Glasgow deserve better than they are getting.Smith blasted a combination of public spending cuts and ldquobackdoor privatisation, saying: ldquoAll of this leaves the city in a state that feels unkempt, unloved and, in a lot of areas, actually really filthy.Askedhe believed Glasgow is going backwards, he said: ldquoYes, definitely. It is a city that is in economic and political decline. It feels as though the power and wealth is increasingly centred in Edinburgh, which is like a mini-London.The Herald on Sunday last month reported Scotlandrsquos changing demographics, which are expected to see families leaving areas such as Inverclyde and Ayrshire for locations such as Edinburgh and the wider Lothians. The capital is in line to enjoy a , population boom, more than Glasgow.Smith said the creation of the Parliament was supposed to help Glasgow, but claimed the reality had been dferent:ldquoOne of the fundamental reasons why devolution is not delivering is that it was supposed to rebalance the economy. I donrsquot see any evidence that that is happening, particularly in the west coast of Scotland.He added: ldquoThere is no way the Scottish Government can keep burying its head in the sand with the state and the decline of Glasgow.Scottish Tory MSP Annie Wells said: ldquoTherersquos no doubt that this SNP council administration is badly letting down Glasgow. Under them we have seen problems across the city go unaddressed, especially concerning the growth of rats and uncollected waste. Meanwhile SNP councillors would prefer to spend their time talking about independence rather than tackling these serious issues.Susan Aitken, the SNP leader of Glasgow council, said: ldquoContrary to what Mr Smith says, GMB members are doing a great job for Glasgow.

But it completely goes against the ethos.\"The person who made these comments has actually nothing to do with the Citizens Assembly. Shes not involved in organising it, shes not involved in any of the advisory boards. Shes just someone who has advocated for Citizens Assemblies because shes been inspired by the Irish example.\"Professor David Farrell of University College Dublin, research director on the first Irish assembly, also told the paper that perceived bias was ldquoa serious risk to the new project.He said: ldquoI think theres a serious riskthere isnt some buy-in from most of the parties that it could undermine it. Thats a serious risk.\"In both of the Irish processes, pretty much all of the parties were able to buy in - and in some cases quite reluctantly in the beginning. But I think that was so important.ldquoYou can see it with social media commentary already that there are people who are seeing this as a stitchup which is what you get early on. The best way to reduce that criticism is to say Look, we have some buy-in from all parties.\"We had much the same when we were talking about abortion because that would have been similarly an extremely controversial topic.\"So whats really important is that its seen to be independent, objective, fully transparent.\":Citizens Assembly hit by recruitment delay amid Unionist calls for boycottDr Escobar told the Herald: ldquoWhat I really want to highlight is that there is a distinction, and itrsquos an important distinction, between public leaders like Joanna, who are advocates and supporters for this kind of methodology for involving the public, versus those who are actually impartial organisers who will have the responsibility to deliver this important process, and shersquos not part of that.\"I donrsquot think that thatrsquos a distinction that has been made properly.ldquoItrsquos all coming out as an attack on Joanna. To be honest, you know, these things very rarely get visibility, these kind of alternative forums of democractic engagement.ldquoTherefore it is important that leaders like Joanna and others come into that space and speak to their own supporters, which I think is what Joanna was saying when she said she was hopeful this is going to help the path to independence.ldquoBut the problem is that there is a public perception that this is just an SNP thing. But actually the Assembly is going to be independent from government.ldquoItrsquos important we are not mixing those who are advocates and public leaders who are calling for this, because they hope itrsquos going to help in their own cause, but that is not necessarily the agenda of the assembly, and certainly the organisers are a dferent sort of group.He went on: ldquoI do think that comments like that, because there is no public perception of the distinction between Joanna and the people actually involved in developing the Assembly, I think itrsquos true that these comments at this stage can make things much harder for people to really find some legitimate ground the Assembly to do its work properlywith public trust.ldquoBut, Joanna, you know, in that sense I donrsquot regret saying that. It does make it harder, until it will begin to distinguish between those who are speaking about the Assembly and calling for it, and those who are actually going to deliver an impartial process.Askedhe was concerned he had been misquoted, he said: \"Speaking to the Scotsman I never mentioned Joannarsquos name, but obviously it was between the lines.\"I did say last week there were unhelpful comments that are making things ten times harder because we are not yet at the stage [of]a mature public conversation about what the Assembly could accomplishgiven the chance.ldquoIt just comes across as very personal, but then again Irsquom not that naive not to understand how things come out.ldquoUnless the Assembly has the trust of everyone across the ideological spectrum then itrsquos not going to work. Itrsquos important that people like Joanne speak up, but itrsquos just about understanding that shersquos not speaking up for ious assemblies, shersquos speaking up from her elected politician position and public leader position rather than anything to do with the actual delivery of the Assembly.\"I welcome contributions from politicians, but itrsquos just about how they choose to frame it.In a series of tweets this morning, Ms Cherry said she stood by her comment, and said it was part of the ldquojoy of democracy that others might disagree.However she also called for people to approach the Assembly with an ldquoopen mind.A short positive thread on #CitizensAssemblies #She told the Herald: \"Of course Irsquom always interested in independence. Thatrsquos hardly a revelation. But the Citizens Assembly is about looking at policy issues which interest everyone regardless of their stance on Independence. The remit at present is wide.\"There are all sorts of future challenges the assembly could look at. Having pioneered this exciting initiative it would be surprisingI wanted to undermine it and I donrsquot.\"If there is a threat to the integrity of the CitizensAssembly it comes from those boycotting it andmisrepresenting its purpose.

These are not bugs that glow in the dark.Using a mix of biotechniques and genetic breeding, the start-up develops high-performance strains of black soldier fly and selects traits such as protein content, growth rate, fat composition and temperature tolerance depending on clientsrsquo needs.The animal feed is then made from the highly-optimised fly maggots, helping to avoid environmentally damaging soy which has been blamed for deforestation and high carbon footprint.The black soldier fly larvae are particularly effective, thanks to an apparently insatiable appetite and astonishing ability to turn almost any kind of organic waste ndash from agricultural leftovers to faeces ndash into high-quality protein, helping to solve two environmental issues at once.While the fly larvae are currently on the agricultural menu, the start-up could also move into developing more efficient ieties of mealworms and crickets for human consumption, making the protein source more affordable.In the case of mealworms, laboratory adaption could help provide an alternative to environmentally devastating palm oil production ndash mealworms have been found to have healthy fatty acid properties similar to palm oil, but with the potential for faster and more efficient production.According to Farrugia, a key benefit of super insect-based animal feeds and fishmeal is that it has the potential to be produced in Scotland ndash avoiding the need to important soy-based feeds mainly from America.Meanwhile, there could also be spin-off benefits for healthier farmed products. ldquoFor example, more salmon are being farmed, and therersquos a need for more fishmeal, he adds. ldquoBut the limit for fishmeal is capped so each fish gets less, which means it takes in less Omega .ldquoWe now need to eat twice the amount of salmon now as we did  years ago to get the same Omega . So, wersquore looking at ways of adding Omega  to the insect product.The start-up, based at Edinburgh Universityrsquos Roslin Innovation Centre, is one of  businesses which was last year selected as part of the Scottish Governmentrsquos poundm challenge fund, Unlocking Ambition.Half were established businesses which have spent the past year being guided by mentors linked to Scottish Enterprise, while the remaining  young start-ups, including Beta Bugs, were introduced to the Royal Society of Edinburghrsquos Unlocking Ambition Enterprise Fellowship programme.:Mad cow disease confirmed on Scottish farmAmong them is a revolutionary robotic lawnmower business, which has introduced ground-breaking mapping technology to enable machines to work across large areas of land, such as golf courses and parks.Joan Kangro, the founder of Kingdom Technologies Ltd., says the robotic lawnmowers have been designed with multiple sensors and cameras to enable them to operate safely in public spaces.ldquoOther robot lawnmowers use reactive safety measures, sothey bump into an obstruction they will go in a new direction. But studies have shown thatrsquos not safe around children and pets, he says.ldquoOur robot sees when someone comes into close proximity and stops before it hits the object.The large terrain robotic lawnmowers are also designed to cut the lawnrsquos edges and close to obstacles ndash removing the need to trim edges of flower beds ndash and to operate using mapping technology, removing the need for boundary cables.Other businesses included in the RSE Fellowship include CogniCare, which uses machine learning to offer personalised support to people affected by dementia, Fodilicious which provides premium, lsquofree-fromrsquo convenience foods including low FODMAP, gluten-free and vegan, and ALICAS which gts bespoke clothing parcels to women in clothing crisis.Professor Dame Anne Glover, RSE President said: ldquoScotland has a global reputation for innovation, and we need to maintain that entrepreneurial spirit.

This is close to where the heart gives out. .But then a Loganair plane passes noisily overhead, and real le intrudes, as it must: on board are two policemen, come to investigate the disappearance of Ivan, a withdrawn local man who has done some work for Dr Alexander. Ivan is later found dead, from natural causes.Dr Alexander had given up his Glasgow practice for ious reasons and, together with his we Maggie, a former anaesthetist, their four boysand their gaggle of pets , had made the long journey to Eday, where he had been appointed as the local GP. The island lies off the Orkney mainland, watched over by Westray, Sanday, Stronsay and Rousay.He wasnrsquot bowled over by the GPrsquos house and surgery when he first encountered them, however. The house was largely dilapidated, with a grubby bathroom the surgery was equally desolate, with a torn examination couch and a computer and keyboard covered in dust.It says much for him that he didnrsquot have an immediate change of heart andto Glasgow and their ldquobeautul west end home. But remain he did.One of the very first patient files he opened was a poignant one: an elderly lady, Agnes ndash Nessie, who was born in , and who lived almost her entire le on Eday, moving only briefly to mainland Orkney, after the Great War. Her medical history and, indeed, her le history were contained in that file.Amidst descriptions of island le, andof the islanders themselves, a key moment in the book occurs when Maggie, newly pregnant, has to be rushed to hospital in Aberdeen after serious complications arise, forcing Dr Alexander to look after their four sons while continuing to see to his many patients.These and other events happened exactly  years ago. The good doctor retired in  and now, aged , lives on another island, Bute. But in this -page book, which details his first year as Edayrsquos GP, they are as fresh asthey happened yesterday.ldquoI suppose it did surprise me, that I could remember so many details, he says. ldquoWhen I started out on the book, the heart of the story was Maggie having to go away. Irsquod been having an email exchange with my agent Laura [Macdougall, of United Agents], who had been looking for somebody who had done the kind of job that I had done. She asked me, what could I write ldquoI thought the best place to start was the really emotional aspects, and then seeI can build from there. It was remarkable what I could remember once you put yourself back into the place.ldquoIt was quite an emotional experience, a powerful one, to write about Eday after a gap of  years, to unwrap things you hadnrsquot thought of.ldquoOne of the boys said it was fascinating to read about their le from somebody rsquos perspective. They think, lsquooh, thatrsquos how dad saw us at that timersquo, and it made me think about how I responded to them as kids.ldquoObviously, in the book there are regrets and there are achievements, nice things as well, but it was quite testing at times, just to write some of the simplest things.Dr Alexander and his family remained on Eday until . They went to Stromness, where he served as one of the GPs, and eventually, on Kirkwall, he became the medical director at Orkney Health Board after that, he was Associate Medical Director at NHS  before going full circle and working at his local GP practice on Bute.His book certainly has a strong sense of place. ldquoThatrsquos what struck me most particularly about the physical location, because you can just see so many things on it. One thing I didnrsquot mention in the book was the Stone of Setter, which is right in the middle of Eday and is one of the tallest standing stones in Orkney. These things are all over the place. You canrsquot escape the fact that there was a Neolithic presence. You canrsquot escape the geology, because it keeps erupting in front of you. It really is quite a remarkable place.ldquoIrsquove gone back regularly to Orkney, managing almost annually, but have only once been back to Eday since we left. When Maggie and I last went, we had a look-round and tried to find folks, and chat to them. That was probably the hardest part, not being able to find them, because obviously a lot of them have died, or moved off the island.ldquoWe subsequently tracked down a couple of people, though. Some of the kids are still there: we were able to meet the ones who had been at school with our kids, but most of the folk who created that environment, which almost had a s feel to it, most of them have moved on.Had Eday changed much from the time when he was the sole local GP  ldquoPhysically, it doesnrsquot look as though it has changed much, he says. ldquoMaybe therersquos a little less obvious crofting, with its stacks, its stacks of hay and barley and peat ... that seemed to have disappeared a bit, from what I could see.Can he envisage having been Edayrsquos GP for the last  years  ldquoThe challenge, he says, ldquowould have been keeping up to date. That would have been the real issue, Whereas now, [no GP] really stays in the one place exclusively, so they can get as wide a training as possible.For a first-time writer, he has done an excellent job with his account. In reference to that passage where he is enjoying nature just before he sees the Loganair plane coming in to land, he says: ldquoI wanted to try to capture the feel of the peace,you like, of the place, but also the speed which with reality can intrude.ldquoYou had to get used to that. If you couldnrsquot live with that, then you had to move on, you had to go back to at least a town environment, where somebody  could take over and be on call.ldquoI loved it, but I was brought up with it ndash we were used to being on our own we were used to seeing the road blocked with snow, and not fussing.Close to Where the Heart Gives Out: A Year in the Le of an Orkney Doctorhardback , Michael OrsquoMara Books."},{"url":null,"title":"mussels-stressed-sea-noise-scottish-research-suggests","story":"Scientists said that while this was not ldquoimmediately dangerous for the creatures, it could impact on growth and may even help explain a decline in mussel banks in some areas of the UK.Previous studies have looked at how noise affects larger marine creatures, such as whales and dolphins.Now a team of marine scientists from Napier University and Heriot Watt University, both in Edinburgh, have looked at the impact on mussels.Despite the molluscs not having ears, the researchers found they can detect changing sound levels in their environment.The scientists collected mussels from the shore at Musselburgh, outside Edinburgh, and tested their response to noise in a lab at the St Abbs Marine Station near Eyemouth ndash a charity dedicated to marine science, conservation and education.Karen Diele, from Edinburgh Napier University, the co-director of research at the marine station, said: ldquoThe blue mussel is an extremely important invertebrate in the UK: it is commercially valuable and it plays an essential ecological role as a reef builder and a filter-feeder that keeps the water clean.Read more:New plea for Scotlands at-risk pearl mussel as bid to stop illegal fishing faltersShe added: ldquoMussels donrsquot have ears but they can detect changing sound levels in their environment.ldquoWe recorded and played the sound of a shiprsquos motor to a sample of blue mussels in a controlled setting, and measured biochemical and behavioural changes in the mussels.ldquoFor the first time in a marine species, we detected noise-induced changes in DNA integrity, indicating an underlying source of stress.Matt Wale, also from Edinburgh Napier University, told how the mussels that had been exposed to noise consumed % less oxygen ndash adding this would lead to increased energy use and potentially slower growth.He continued: ldquoThe filtration rate, or how much algae they consume, decreased by over % and there was a % increase in valve gape, which means the mussels are spending more time vulnerable to predators.Another member of the team, Mark Hartl from Heriot-Watt University, stated: ldquoGiven the wide distribution of mussels in areas where they may be exposed to noise, the impact of noise does not appear to be fatal or immediately dangerous for mussels.Read more:Climate change: Scottish shellfish threatened by Japanese invadersldquoHowever, this doesnrsquot mean it isnrsquot having a long-term effect on mussel populations in high noise areas, it could be affecting their growth, reproductivity and may help explain the decline of mussel banks in some areas of the UK.He added: ldquoItrsquos important that we understand how noise is stressing mussels in environmental risk assessments so that we can ensure environmental policy and regulation is effective.The research was supported with funding from the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology for Scotland.The team is also looking at how Norway lobsters, squid and native oysters respond to underwater noise."},{"url":null,"title":"may-acknowledge-debt-gratitude-military-farewell-defence-speech","story":"Three Chinook transport helicopters and their crews have been based in the African country since July last year in support of French operations against extremists.The Prime Minister will announce a six-month extension to the operation as she delivers her final military speech before leaving office later this month.She will visit the UKrsquos Permanent Joint Headquartersand Natorsquos maritime headquarters in Northwood, north-west London, to thank the military for their efforts under her premiership.Mrs May is expected to say: ldquoThere is no greater responsibility as Prime Minister than ensuring the safety and security of our people.ldquoAnd doing so is not something any Prime Minister can achieve without you ndash the brave men and women of our armed forces.ldquoYou are not just a part of British le ndash you are the guarantors of British le.

There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amBronze medallist last time round, Taylah Spence begins her quest to recapture silverware today at the NatWest International Island Games.

The workshop will look at three charitable, grant-giving trusts funded by players of People’s Postcode Lottery — People’s Postcode Trust, Postcode Community Trust and Postcode Local Trust.Together these trusts fund a range of projects which promote human rights, combat discrimination and poverty, improve community health and well-being, tackle isolation, support arts and physical recreation and increase access to outdoor and green space and much more. Last year, over £ million was awarded through the three community programme trusts, benefitting thousands of local charities and good causes in every part of the UK.Good causes to have been awarded funding in Orkney include £, for the Papay Development Trust’s kelp store crafts and heritage centre and £, for Orkney Blide Trust to help support those living with mental health problems.Speaking ahead of the event, Mr Carmichael said: “I am very much looking forward to hosting this event for local organisations supported by the People’s Postcode Lottery in Orkney.#Many local projects have been made possible thanks to funds raised by their players, and I am keen to see many more successful applications in future.”Calum Munro, senior community programmes officer at People’s Postcode Lottery added: “We want to do all we can to help local charities and good causes successfully apply for funding from three community programmes trusts.#It is fantastic that funds raised by players of People’s Postcode Lottery are making a huge dference in their own communities.

A week does not seem to pass without someone appealing for a gentler, kinder style of politics. Well,my own experience this week is anything to go by it will be a long time coming. Indeed it is probably a forlorn hope. I am just back from attending the first meeting of the ninth session of the European Parliament held in Strasbourg. It was an eventful experience and one that, unlike my colleagues, I am able to contrast and compare against the eight years I served in the Scottish Parliament. While the parliaments are dferent in a iety of waysthere was enough in my first week to give me a taste of what to expect. Sadly I can testy the nature of political discourse has deteriorated signicantly. Thus far it is not the behaviour of the parliamentarians that is especially dferent, but the relationship between politicians and the public that has changed. Politicians the world over and from all political colours can be pompous, ignorant, isive and rude – and courteous, inspiring, witty and magnanimous – or a combination of both – but that has always been the case. What I found this week was that in my  years away from professional politics as an elected servant of the people, the mood of the public appears to have changed dramatically for the worse.• : Outrage after new MEP Anne Widdecombe compares Brexit to emancipation of slavesIn my past le as a Tory MSP, I witnessed all sorts of stunts by opponents and colleagues, and took part intentionally or inadvertently in a few myself, but I cannot recall anything other than a handful of letters of complaint, never mind abusive language, in that time. Now there is an instant reaction that, courtesy of the internet, reaches elected members in a wide iety of forms – from text messages, emails,tweets and presumably Facebook posts . Some of it is vile, and the quantity surprised even an old dog like me.One particular example was the opening of the European Parliament itself, where the -plus members were told to stand for its “national anthem” before proceedings officially began. The Brexit Party MEPs had been sitting down at that point but had agreed amongst ourselves thatasked to stand we would do so with our backs to the dais.For us it was a quiet and dignied way of showing our rejection of the idea of a European superstate with its own flag, embassies, diplomatic corps, army – and an anthem that had already been rejected by prime minister TonyBlair and in referendums on the proposed EU constitution by the French and Dutch.As a statement, it did not require brightly coloured T-shirts with offensive slogans rejecting the UK’s democratic choice, or placards for MEPs to hold up in chamber– or causing a commotion or storming out in protest. It was just a silent rejection of an example of empire-building that has caused Europeans of all nations, but especially the British, to say we’ve had enough. After this short moment we then turned, sat down and participated in the remaining proceedings.Within minutes the messages were pinging into our phones, the emails were arriving and the media, receiving and witnessing the same, only wanted to talk about that one “disrespectful” event. For all but a few exceptions the Liberal Democrats’ “Bollocks to Brexit” t-shirts were ignored unless we made a point of asking why. • : MPs step up plans to block no-deal Brexit amid leadership contestEmails calling me a iety of epithets that would peel the nish of my mother’s front door soon reached my inbox. A suspicious swarm of similarly worded emails then flew in – berating me in emotional terms that would make those of a gentler disposition wish to seek solitude in a dark room.Former BBC politics journalist Gavin Esler tweeted we “shamelessly copied” the Nazi Party in s Germany who turned their backs on a Jewish speaker in the Reichstag – insinuating we share some political DNA them. This was somewhat ironic given the anthem, Beethoven’s Ode to Joy was one of Hitler’s favourites and played to him on his birthday. More importantly Esler’s reaction completely ignored the lineage that turning one’s back is a form of political protest and signalled the double standards of so many of those criticising it on this occasion.As City lawyer Alex Deane pointed out, British POWs turned their backs on Japan’s Emperor Akihito in  as he passed down the Mall with Her Majesty the Queen. In  and  members of the public – co-ordinated by campaign groups including Hope Not Hate and Prayers for Peace – turned their backs on English Democratic League rallies held in Bradford city centre. In  some members of the public turned their backs on the funeral cortege of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher as it passed on its way to St Paul’s Cathedral. Likewise, later that same year hundreds of NYPD officers turned their backs on a speech by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at a funeral of two officers killed on duty. More recently women turned their backs on Canadian premier Justin Trudeau protesting against his “fake feminism” and the same protest has been used against President Trump. Were those people borrowing their form of protest from the Nazis, did those protests receive condemnation from our liberal intelligentsia or be ridiculed by BBC staff, past and present, as my colleagues and I were  As the week moved on so did the media attention – but not the faux-outrage of social media victims. Quite correctly the media wanted to know what we thought of the EU’s backroom dealing to agree the candidates for ious positions including the parliament’s own president, president of the European Commission, the president of the Council of Ministers and president of the European Central Bank. While we pointed to the democratic shortcomings of that process, that is just one symptom of the EUs centralised and secretive government, the communications parading the personal upset over our back-turning just kept coming – without any reference to the EU elite’s disrespect to their own people.A gentler, kinder style of politics  If it ever existed I don’t think it’s ing soon.

Come on. We’ve got to show a bit more gumption about this.”His campaign received the support of Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who said Mr Johnson was “better placed” than Jeremy Hunt to “deliver what we need to do at this critical time”.Mr Javid, who is widely believed to have his sights set on becoming chancellor under the new prime minister, called for an emergency budget for a no-deal Brexit.“Trust in our democracy will be at stakewe don’t make October  a ‘deal or no deal’ deadline,” he said.“To prepare that, we are agreed on the need for ramped-up no-deal preparations, including  a budget.”Mr Hunt also insisted he was not bluffing about being willing to walk away without a deal, although he told the Sundayit was “not the most secure way of guaranteeing Brexit” because MPs would try to block it.Former Tory leadership hopeful Sam Gyimah said more than  of the party’s own MPs could vote against a no-deal Brexit.Speaking to Sky News, the former education minister said there are a “signicant number” of Tory MPs who are looking at legislative options to block a no-deal Brexit.He added: “I think it is about , -plus. But what they will be looking to do is stop a prime minister from proroguing Parliament in order to deliver no deal, and tocreate options for the new prime minister so that no deal is not the only option we face on October .”Mr Gyimah warned no-deal was “the most successful way to have a second Scottish independence referendum [and] break up the UK”.He said he was not prepared to vote for a motion of no-confidence in the government over Brexit, but Mr Grieve confirmed he would do so “with great reluctance”.Speaking on the BBC’s Pienaar’s Politics programme, he said: “We are going to have in the course of the next hours an important bill on Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland and Brexit go very closely together.“The chances are thatBrexit goes through as No Deal it’s going to be the end of the Northern Ireland Union with the UK, with serious political consequences flowing from it.“So that’s a bill which is a perfectly legitimate place to start looking at how one might make sure how a Brexit deal is fully debated.”Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, the Justice Secretary, David Gauke, said he would resign rather than serve under a prime minister who took the UK out of the EU without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia.

Calum McAuley, an apprentice with Braid Electrical Services, won ‘Apprentice of the Year’.And Jordan Haggan, apprentice electrician with Alexander Bonar  Co, was highly commended in the same category. They were nominated for the accolade alongside another three of their College colleagues. The Northern Ireland Electrical Awards, which represent the pinnacle achievement for the electrical industry in Northern Ireland, recognise and reward the achievements of those working in the province’s erse electrical sector. Organised by the Electrical Magazine and judged by an independent  of respected industry experts, the awards collectively recognise the achievements of both companies and iniduals. Sean McAleese, Training Manager at Northern Regional College, said they are thrilled that the hard work and talent of so many of their apprentices are being recognised at these awards.“We have worked closely with local employers over many years to ensure we are equipping our students with industry-level skills, and these invaluable relationships help us to ensure our students receive training at the very highest level,” he said.Apprentice of the Year Calum, who is currently enrolled on a Level  electrical installation programme, said he always wanted to be an electrician.“I’ve always tried, both in College and on-site, to achieve the very highest standards, in everything I do,” said Calum. “It’s great to have all that hard work and effort recognised with an award like this one.”Jordan Haggan, , said from the outset of his career he spent a lot of time working alongside electricians.“But it took me a while to make the leap of faith and pursue it as a career myself. I thought it was too late to start but the apprenticeship has opened new doors for me, and I really enjoy the work I do and am proud of the new skills I’ve developed,” he said.“This award is really just the icing on the cake for me and it means a lot to be recognised for my hard work.”The  Electrical Awards took place recently at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, in Belfast.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.th Lisburn Coca-Cola HBC Half Marathon, K Road Race and Fun RunUniversal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"balmoral master chef provides boost for guide dogs ni","story":"WITH entries for the Balmoral Hotel’s Master*Chef compet-ition drawing to a close on Friday, the competition to find Ireland’s next top chef could also have a positive lasting impact on the work of its charity partner, Guide Dogs NI.Through their efforts, Guide Dogs NI help change the way sight loss affects people’s lives by ensuring that they can get out and about on their own terms. This involves tireless campaigning, fundraising, and, of course, as Guide Dogs NI Engagement Officer, Hannah Lyons explains, the support of iniduals and businesses such as the Balmoral Hotel on the Blacks Road.“It’s wonderful that the Balmoral Hotel have chosen us as their charity partners,” she says.“We are really excited for the upcoming Master*Chef. Fundraising is integral to all of the work that we do. It costs around £, to support a guide dog from birth to retirement. We cover their whole working le as a guide dog including the cost of their food and ongoing training. “Guide dogs are le changing, but there is a lot of work involved in it, so it is essential to have the support from iniduals or organisations like the Balmoral.”As well as raising funds, the Master*Chef competition will also help raise awareness of the work Guide Dogs NI do and inform people of some of struggles faced by the visually impaired.“Our ambition is for a future where everybody with sight loss has the confidence and support to live their lives to the full,” Hannah explains. “A big part of it is access to and experience of services such as shops, bars, hotels and restaurants. We talk about the ‘purple pound’, which is the spending power of anybody living with a disability. We always say that it shouldn’t be underestimated. If someone living with sight loss has a positive experience when they are out and about with any service provider then they are going towith their loyalty and spending power.“We’re quite fortunate here in Northern Irelandthat businesses are supportive on the whole, but we just need to keep that message current and keep it at the forefront of people’s mind. Businesses need to be actively welcoming visitors with disabilities because it isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.”While there is still plenty of work to be done in making the North of Ireland disability friendly, Guide Dogs NI have helped drive through some vital changes. “We’re somewhat dferent to our counterparts across the water because they’re still campaigning on some of the things that we already have such as audiovisual on buses and disability awareness training for taxi drivers here,” Hannah says.“We have those things in place, so we are lucky in that respect. One of the big things we’re working on at the minute is our pavement parking campaign. Parking is a problem throughout the country but because of rising congestion levels it’s getting worse. It can really negatively impact on somebody’s day when someone un-thoughtfully abandons their car and that visually impaired person then has to turn back or make the decisionthey should walk into the road to complete their journey. That’s a level of stress and anxiety that nobody should have to deal with.”Training guide dogs is, of course, a key part of the charity’s work, but they are now asking for volunteers to become sighted guides for people with visual impairment. “A guide dog sometimes isn’t for everyone and that’s why My Guide is our free service that enables people with a vision impairment to get out of their homes and into the community,” Hannah explains.“With a volunteer as their sighted guide, they can overcome challenges presented by unfamiliar places or crowded areas, enjoy exploring and becoming involved in their local communities and ultimately become more independent. “We provide all the volunteer trainingand ask for a commitment of a few hours once a week to help someone with a visual impairment to get out and about. There are people located across the whole of Northern Ireland currently waiting for a volunteer and it is truly such a rewarding role to take on.”If anyone is interested becoming a sited guide or wants to find out more, they can get in touch with the Guide Dogs NI team at Belfast@guidedogs.org.ukThe Master*Chef grand finale will take place as part of Féile an Phobail at the Balmoral Hotel on Wednesday th of August .For more information, see: balmoralhotelbelfast pro-masterchef"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-02-at-11.22.45.png","title":"meet aaron flanagan","story":"In , Aaron Flanagan and his brother quit their ‘proper jobs’ to open Comic Book Guys, Northern Ireland#s largest independent comic book store and the first-ever authorised CGC dealer.The one-stop shop located on Great VIctoria Street has been serving Belfast’s thriving comic book scene through golden, silver age, bronze to modern comics, movie memorabilia, toys, collectables and even comics made by local creators .In this week’s conversation, we chat all about serving a small market, the impact superhero movies have had on the industry, what it’s like to set up your own business and why a vintage medium like comic books are still thriving today.Check it out.

There can and must be no  choice between honouring the solemn commitments of the Belfast Agreement and delivering on the decision of the British people in the EU referendum.\"We must do both.\"The PM, who finishes her term in Downing Street in just over two weeks, also urged the parties to work together to restore Stormont.\"The devolution settlement brought about by the Belfast Agreement was an example for the world in uniting people behind a shared future,\" she said.\"And as the parties in Northern Ireland continue in talks to restore that devolution, the hope and history surrounding it should be a powerful reminder of the imperative of not letting that progress slip away.\"While both Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt have said they would take the UK out of the European Union without a dealnecessary, Mrs May cautioned against that, saying it \"would have undoubted consequences for our economy and for the Union\".Instead, the outgoing Prime Minister insisted securing a \"good\" Brexit deal was vital to the future of the UK."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38291208.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/speed.jpg","title":"112 motorists caught speeding every day in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Everyone should stop and think about this figure for a moment. \"Every time you hear about a fatal or serious collision on the news, there is a family, a circle of friends, a community plunged into mourning. \"There are many other people across the country who are having to learn how to cope with le-changing injuries after being involved in serious collisions.\"This is why it is critically important to remind all drivers that there are consequences to breaking the speed limit and driving in a manner that does not consider the safety of all road users. \"Police will continue to enforce the law and are determined to make Northern Irelands roads safer.\"If everyone slowed down, did not drive after drinking or taking drugs, wore a seatbelt and drove with greater care and attention then together we can save lives on our roads.\""},{"url":null,"title":"belfast leisure centre closed after group of men intimidate staff","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EU’s top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker.

The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia.

Although praised by Western allies, the deal angered many Greeks, who consider use of the term harbours expansionist aims on the Greek province of the same name.Mr Mitsotakis, son of a former prime minister and brother of a former foreign minister, was pledging to make Greece more business-friendly, attract foreign investment, modernise the country’s notorious bureaucracy and cut taxes.We underestimated the scale of the opposition toward SyrizaEuclid Tsakalotos, Greek finance ministerSpeaking after the exit polls, Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said: “This is a big win for New Democracy.

You offered it generously. From today, a dficult but beautul fight beginsKyriakos MitsotakisThe results indicated that Greek voters were bucking a recent trend in Europe of citizens rejecting the political mainstream and turning to populist and eurosceptic parties.“I asked for a strong mandate to change Greece. You offered it generously,” Mr Mitsotakis said in his victory speech. “From today, a dficult but beautul fight begins.”Mr Mitsotakis, , vowed to abide by his campaign pledges to cut taxes, attract investment and improve the job market.

We fully respect the popular vote,” Mr Tsipras said in a speech from central Athens.He said his party would work to protect the rights of working Greeks as “a responsible but dynamic opposition” to the government.Mr Tsipras said he hoped New Democracy’sto government “will not lead to vengeance… particularly toward the signicant achievements to protect the social majority and the workers”.The election was the first held since Greece emerged from three international bailouts that were dependent on successive governments implementing strict austerity measures, including major tax hikes and spending cuts.The financial crisis saw unemployment and poverty levels skyrocket and the economy shrink by a quarter.Mr Mitsotakis, the son of a former prime minister, brother of a former foreign minister and uncle to a newly elected mayor of Athens, fought during the campaign to shed the image of family privilege.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Kyriakos Mitsotakis celebrates with supporters He pledged to make Greece more business-friendly, attract foreign investment, to modernise the country’s notorious bureaucracy and to cut taxes.Mr Tsipras, , called the election three months ahead of schedule after Syriza suffered a severe defeat in European Union and local elections in May and early June.He had led his small Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, party to power in  on promises to repeal the austerity of Greece’s first two bailouts.But after months of tumultuous negotiations with international creditors that saw Greece nearly crash out of the European Union’s joint currency, he was forced to change tack, signing up to a third bailout and imposing the accompanying spending cuts and tax hikes.He also cemented a deal with neighbouring North Macedonia under which that country changed its name from plain Macedonia. Although praised by Western allies, the deal angered many Greeks, who consider use of the term harbours expansionist aims on the Greek province of the same name."},{"url":null,"title":"279329","story":"A -year-old man is due to appear at court in Derry this morningcharged with a series of offences relating to disorder in Creggan last Thursday .He will face charges of riotous behaviour, attempted criminal damage and intentionally encouraging or assisting in riotous behaviour.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"house commons told derrys city deal dependent restoration stormont","story":"The implementation of Derry’s City Deal is dependent on the re-establishment of government in Northern Ireland, the House of Commons was told yesterday.During questions to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, MPs sought more detail around a timeline for delivering City Deal projects.Labour MP Mike Amesbury, Shadow Minister for Employment, asked what comparative assessment she has made of the scope of city deals in Northern Ireland His question was answered by John Penrose MP, Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, who said: “In line with our  manesto commitment, we have already announced two city deals in Northern Ireland, £m for Belfast and a combined package of £m for Derry and Strabane.“Early stage discussions have also begun with other councils in the mid-south and west and Causeway Coast and Glens.”Addressing the House, Mr Amesbury recalled a recent visit to the “wonderful city of Derry” where he spoke with those shaping the education offer, adding, “they told me that a central aspect of the City Deal is the establishment of a riverfront university, medical centre and innovation hub.“Could the minister update the house on the timeline of progress of this much-needed facility ”He was told that the timeline of that is “the same as the timeline in the rest of the City Deal, which is that business cases have to be worked up, as business cases clearly for all the projects in it have to work well.“There are incidentally for any business cases that don’t shape up, many, many other ideas which can also be brought through and they will then get approved and will then proceed.”Before he got an opportunity to finish answering the question, The Speaker called Belfast MP Emma Little Pengelly forward who pressed him about progress on the Belfast City Deal.The DUP MP asked for detail around discussions with the head of the civil service and city council about getting those projects to implementation and when he anticipated the first project will be rolled out.“The dficulty here is that City Deals are a local initiative, we can only lay foundations but they need to be taken forward both by the local partners and local councils, but also ultimately, as soon as we get the Stormont Executive re-established they have to have a central role in this.“So, while we are making progress as fast as we decently can, and so are the local councils, we are ultimately also dependent on the progress of the talks,” Mr Penrose concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"psni carry search derry relation new ira activity","story":"Police in Derry have said they have carried out a search of a building site in the city this morning in connection to the activities of the New IRA.The PSNI say that detectives from the Terrorism Investigation Unit conducted the search at Clon Dara in the Skeoge district as part of an ongoing investigation into violent dissident republicanism.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshDetective Chief Inspector Stuart Grfin said: “Today’s search operation was carefully planned to cause the least disruption to the local community and was carried out by officers investigating the activities of the New IRA.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

Both batsmen set about the task in a positive manner with Campbell especially hitting out.Lindsay was eventually bowled for  runs and that brought Conor Moag to the wicket, scoring a quick seven, getting out to a good catch.

That is why we have arranged tonightrsquos meeting and I hope it will be well supported by the people of Downpatrick, across the district and further afield.Mr Morgan claimed many people he has spoken to want change and have an appetite for a new Assembly comprising independent members, not established political party representatives.He continued: ldquoTonightrsquos meeting is the next stage in the campaign and we are approaching this on a county by county basis.

He also pointed out that gold was more common in Ireland during the Bronze Age than in most other parts of Europe.The jury concluded that the fastener had been intentionally hidden or concealed and therefore declared it treasure trove.Although young Elizabeth is likely to receive compensation for discovering the fastener, the coroner ruled that it becomes the property of the Queen and will be handed over to the Treasury.ARDGLASS mdash A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded on a  year-old man whose body was found washed up at Ardglass in February this year after the boat on which he was fishing sank.An inquest jury at Downpatrick on Thursday heard how James Edward Greer, of Elmfield Park, Donaghadee, had been held up in the water for about  minutes by his skipper, who eventually had to let go of him.The badly decomposed body of Mr Greer, who could not swim, was washed up at Sheepland Begg on February .The skipper of the boat said he held the deceased for about five minutes after their vessel was hit by a big wave off Peel in the Isle of Man.He tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but Mr Greer was unconscious and after another ten minutes he had to get him go because he himself was in danger.

The marking and selling activities of the company will be unaffected and customers will continue to be supplied.The company spokesman said he regretted that it had become necessary to cease the manufacture of rope and twine products and carpet fibre at the local factory.ldquoThe cost of production at Ballygowan has consistently exceeded what the market can bear, while the remoteness of the factory from its principal market in Great Britain imposes a further burden in respect of prohibitive transport costs, particularly for finished goods, he added.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick Young Farmers had a very successful day at the th annual Young Farmersrsquo county rally on Saturday.

It is thought that a chain of such buoys could one day be one of our main sources of power..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street open again after three month delay  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS Irish Street finally reopened to two-way traffic last weekend after a protracted environmental improvement scheme took twice as long to complete than originally planned.Contractors removed barriers to allow the flow of two-way traffic on Friday evening but traffic lights at the Market Street junction mdash which were permanently on red during work on the pound, public realm project mdash were not adjusted.Motorists arriving at the bottom of the street were left confused and had to carefully ease across the busy junction and while the traffic lights remained stuck on red the following morning, they were finally adjusted.The street is scheduled to be closed to all traffic this weekend as the final touches are put to the environmental scheme which will see the road between the Market Street and John Street junctions resurfaced.The Department for Infrastructure, which managed the scheme on behalf of the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council, has admitted that the delayed public realm scheme had a ldquonegative impact on trading across the town.In addition, government officials also conceded that more should have been done to keep the business community affected by the overrunning project better informed.In May, business owners and traders took part in a protest at the delay in completing the environmental revamp to provide new granite paving, street lighting and furniture. The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated. Lessons have surely been learned and keeping people better informed must be the priority.ldquoThe Collinsrsquo Corner upgrade is vital and I hope that once this scheme has been completed a lsquoserious lookrsquo will be taken at addressing the congestion problem in nearby Edward Street which is a major health and safety issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Lynch excels at Spelga race  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ACrsquos Seamus Lynch won race seven of the NIMRA Championship, which took place at Spelga Dam on Saturday,, the aptly named Spelga Skyline.Typical Mourne weather of passing showers and fog did not deter the  entries.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a shamrock, suggesting that they could perhaps be offered the chance of being awarded this or a poppy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New civic amenity centre set to open in Downpatrick  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new civic amenity centre is scheduled to open later this month.The new site at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town will replace the nearby Cloonagh Road facility which has been struggling for some time to keep pace with increasing demand.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is building the new centre which is larger than the current facility and will be able to handle considerably more waste.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Finally, it cuts the lettuce from the rest of the plant without crushing it so that it is ldquosupermarket-ready.Co-author Josie Hughes said: ldquoFor a human, the entire process takes a couple of seconds, but itrsquos a really challenging problem for a robot.The Vegebot has two main components: a computer vision system and a cutting system.The overhead camera on the Vegebot takes an image of the lettuce field and first identies all the lettuces in the image, and then, for each lettuce, classies whether it should be harvested or not. --The Vegebot has two main components: a computer vision system and a cutting system  --A lettuce might be rejected because it is not yet mature, or it might have a disease that could spread to other lettuces in the harvest.The researchers developed and trained a machine-learning algorithm on example images of lettuces.Once the Vegebot could recognise healthy lettuces in the lab, it was then trained in the field, in a iety of weather conditions, on thousands of real lettuces.A second camera on the Vegebot is positioned near the cutting blade, and helps ensure a smooth cut.The researchers were also able to adjust the pressure in the robotrsquos gripping arm so that it held the lettuce firmly enough not to drop it, but not so firm as to crush it.The force of the grip can be adjusted for other crops.ldquoWersquove still got to speed our Vegebot up to the point where it could compete with a human, but we think robots have lots of potential in agri-tech, said Ms Hughes.Co-author Julia Cai said: ldquoAt the moment, harvesting is the only part of the lettuce le cycle that is done manually, and itrsquos very physically demanding.In future, robotic harvesters could help address problems with labour shortages in agriculture, and could also help reduce food waste by being trained to pick only ripe vegetables..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Tip of the iceberg  New Vegebot could help plug agriculture labour gaps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
