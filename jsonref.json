Meanwhile, the big supermarkets benefited from their essential retailer status, as consumers spent more money on groceries instead of in restaurants, cafes and pubs.Morrisons said online sales had tripled, and it also benefited from its deal with Amazon to supply wholesale products to convenience stores.The supermarket was the only one of the four largest chains in the UK to gain market share over the Christmas period, according to analysis from research group Kantar, thanks to price cuts and an increase in home deliveries.However, the retailer expects its profits to be in line with expectations, less than half the £420m to £440m it had once anticipated, after it agreed to pay back £230m received from the government’s business rates relief.The chain, which supplies everything from tinned goods and pet food to wallpaper and garden sheds, has benefited from its essential retailer status. In addition, many of its stores are located on retail parks, which wary shoppers have tended to favour instead of high streets. B\u0026ampM’s owners, the billionaire Arora brothers, awarded themselves a £30m payout following soaring Christmas sales, pushing their total idends received over the last 12 months to almost £100m.As a result of the lockdown sales boom, B\u0026ampM intends to open up to 45 new stores by March, a third more than it had previously planned.JD Sports, Britain’s biggest sportswear group, has been able to shrug off many of the problems faced by retailers during the pandemic, and hiked its profit forecasts following robust trading.JD said that its customers had “readily switched between physical and digital channels” but warned that Covid restrictions were likely to keep its UK stores closed until Easter.The casual wear group, which also owns brands Size?, Blacks Leisure, Millets and Go Outdoors, said earlier in the pandemic that its athleisure products had proved popular with customers stuck at home.The sportswear chain had been in rescue talks to buy beleaguered department store chain Debenhams, but pulled out when Topshop-owner Arcadia went into administration at the end of November.Christmas trading was a mixed picture at high street stalwart Marks \u0026amp Spencer, as store closures knocked its sales of clothing and homeware, while its food halls fared better during the key period.Sales of clothing and homeware dropped by a quarter during the 13 weeks to 26 December, as consumers turned to pyjamas rather than party outfits, with a near halving of in-store sales only partly balanced out by a rise in online sales.M\u0026ampS warned that the trading outlook “remains very challenging” because the latest lockdown and store closures could last until Easter.Covid heralded a reversal in fortunes for Greggs bakery chain, famous for its steak bakes and vegan sausage rolls, which predicted it will slump to its first-ever annual loss as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.The Newcastle-based chain’s sales dropped by more than £300m year on year in 2020, leading it to forecast a £15m annual loss, its first since listing on the stock market in 1984, after Covid restrictions closed its stores and consumers made lunch at home rather than buying a sandwich while out and about.Greggs, which has more than 2,000 outlets in the UK, does not expect profits to recover to pre-Covid levels until 2022. However, the retailer’s expansion plans remain on track and it plans to open a further 100 stores this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b1ac3660f6a7d242d416b7e1a6b2978808cadd5/0_113_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=45d5798ff6208fa48041f9e3b07a532d","title":"teachers and parents in england tell us about returning to school coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers about their experiences during the pandemic, especially those working in SEN schools and nurseriesAccording to a survey, teachers in England are being forced to prioritise class places among vulnerable students and the children of key workers because of a huge increase in demand.In SEN (special education needs) schools some children are missing out due to problems with infection control, timetables and transport.

Five people explain why they made their home into the perfect replica of an earlier eraWill future generations look at the interior design of the early 21st century in appreciation? Possibly not. We do not appear to have crafted many design classics, unless slab-like corner sofas in mud-grey velvet are Eames chairs in the making. Our feature walls are gaudy our furniture cheaply made. Scarcely anything seems to be built to last, which is just as well, as the next Instagram-led interior design trend will be along soon enough.But there are those who retreat from modern trends into the interiors of the past, drawn by the allure of original designs. We speak to five people whose homes are portals into the past.My mum says that I was always into the 30s, ever since she can remember. I’d go around to my aunt and uncle’s house and play old dance band records. At weekends, I’d rummage in Patrick’s Saleroom, a sort of junk shop that’s still around today. I’d go there every weekend from the age of seven or eight and buy all sorts of weird things: gramophones, gas mantles, electric toasters, Bakelite hairdryers. I have an obsession with 30s vacuums. They’re the best! They really get all the crap out of the carpet.The music, the fashion and the style were magical. Even the food was great – everything was homegrown back then. I would go back in time now if I could, although I’d take my family with me. It probably wouldn’t live up to my expectations unless I was rich and able to do fun things such as go to the Savoy theatre and go out dancing.I grew up over the road from the house I live in. It used to belong to an old lady. She was well over 100 when I was a child. She was a real character: a former schoolteacher, very strict. Us kids used to call it the witch’s house, because if a ball hit her window you’d see an eye poke out from behind her venetian blinds. She’d come outside with a carving knife and cut the ball open. But she was a lovely lady, really. It must have been annoying for her, all these kids knocking balls into her windows.After she died, the house lay unused for nine years, until I bought it. I found her old ration book and letters from her sweetheart, who died in the first world war, under the floorboards. The letters were quite upsetting to read, knowing how he died young.Most of my furniture comes from Patrick’s Saleroom, unless it’s something rare and hard to find, in which case I use eBay. Everything is vintage, apart from my Alexa – but that’s hidden in an old speaker. I have a laptop for work and watching Netflix. But that’s it. I restored a 1951 Bush television, so I can watch old movies on it. I know it’s not from the 30s, but TVs weren’t popular back then.There’s a lot I don’t like about modern life. I find society quite greedy. Everyone’s a bit more selfish. If I live by any 30s values in my life, I suppose it’s trying to have good manners: be polite, and nice to folk, and help them as much as you can.When I come home from work, I like to shut the door and pretend I’m back in 1936. Not to the extent it’s freaky, though. I do go to work and see my friends and have a normal life. But my house is my little time capsule. The 30s stay here when I leave the house, I’m back in the real world.I forget I have a 30s house. If I don’t warn people before they come over for the first time, they walk in, stop speaking, then ask me if it’s my grandparents’ house. I had a postman come to the house once and ask me if my mum and dad were in. I get it. It looks like an old lady’s house.Everything in my house is 40s-style – or if it isn’t, it’s hidden away. I have three children, so there’s no way in the world I could get away without having modern things such as a TV and a washing machine. But the washing machine is covered with a curtain and the toaster is in a cupboard under the worktop. I have a real 40s toaster on the counter: I daren’t turn it on, even though it does have a plug fitted. My kids are always complaining about the toaster. They go: “Mum, why is the toaster in the cupboard?” I say: “Because that’s the way I like it!” But they don’t mind, really, because they know it makes me happy.I’m most proud of my living room. It’s so relaxing. I love the rocking chair and the old clock on the mantelpiece. If you don’t look at the TV, you can imagine you are in a 40s lounge. I love to sit there and read old magazines from the 40s. Sometimes, they have people’s addresses on the label. I think about them: what were they like? What lives did they lead?I get all my furniture on the island. There’s a brilliant place called ReStore that restores old furniture that people have donated: almost everything in my house is from there. There are two charity shops on the island that are also really good – I can always pick up beautiful things there and they aren’t expensive. The charity shops on the mainland know about vintage now they put up the price.I dress in 40s clothes, too. I love the style – it’s very feminine. The ladies always got dressed up to go out back then. They took care, you know? No leggings and long T-shirts! I always wear a skirt, no matter what I’m doing. You have to wear thick tights in winter, though.I love the simplicity of the era. It’s not over the top, like it is now. There’s too much stuff now. It’s all about what car you have, or what clothes you wear. Even modern cars are stressful. There’s so much that can go wrong with them. Back then, things were simple and modest. It felt like everyone was in it together. People were different – they did things for each other. I love that sense of neighbourliness and community.If I had the chance to go back to the 40s, I’d love to go. Not to stay there – I imagine it was pretty terrifying to live through the war. But maybe after the war, when it was all over, to visit a world without cars and people everywhere. That’s one of the reasons my husband and I moved to Uist – to get away from technology and crowds and to live a simpler life. There are plenty of places on the island where you can look around and it’s exactly as it would have been in the 40s. Although, sadly, technology has followed us to the island – we got 4G last year. I’m constantly looking at my phone now. Adverts pop up and I think: “Ooh, I’d love to buy that.” I wish I wasn’t looking at my phone all the time.I’d say my style is mid-century American ranch style, with a tiki influence. I’ve always loved vintage style, ever since I was a teenager. In the 80s, I was into the mod scene. I remember walking into a friend’s house when I was about 19 and everything was styled like the 50s: there was a cocktail bar and 50s magazines. I thought it was so stylish. After that, I never looked back: I’ve decorated all of my houses in a vintage way.When I started collecting in the 80s, you could pick up stuff in charity shops and flea markets for next to nothing. I still have a 50s pale-green and pink bedroom suite I got at a Manchester flea market in the early 90s. Nowadays, I get most of my things through specialist dealers, although you can also get good pieces from eBay and Etsy if you look hard enough. I’d love some Heywood-Wakefield or Paul Frankl rattan furniture and I’m desperate for an Alfred Meakin cactus teapot – I have almost the full set, but I’m missing the teapot.I have two cocktail bars. They are pretty special. One is a mid-century bar with a glitter vinyl front. My tiki bamboo bar I got from a friend who was selling it. I’ve owned several bamboo bars over the years. At one point, I had about four bars in my house at the same time. I had to get rid of them, though – you can’t keep them all.I do have modern bits in the house. My kitchen isn’t original. It’s styled on a Youngstown kitchen from the US it would be difficult and expensive to ship one over, so I created the look using chevron cupboard pulls and aluminium trim on a modern kitchen. I had really positive comments on my Instagram account from people in the US, which was nice.The only thing in my house that I really hate is the TV, because it doesn’t fit with the decor. We have a modern TV – my husband, Nigel, insisted. It is nice to watch old movies on a decent screen, though. William Morris said that you should have nothing in your house that you don’t know to be useful or believe to be beautiful. Everything in my house is beautiful to me, apart from my telly – which is useful!I don’t wish I lived in the 50s. I love vintage style, not vintage values. When I’m reading magazines from that period, some of the adverts are so archaic. It’s all about buying the woman in your life a vacuum cleaner for Christmas. But I couldn’t live in modern surroundings, either. This trend for grey at the moment – I can’t bear it. Everything is grey. People are even painting the exterior of their houses grey! I need colour in my life.I’ve felt so fortunate to have this beautiful home during Covid. I get so much pleasure from every item in my home. It’s so lovely to sit at my bar and have a mai tai while I put some lounge music on. I feel so grateful to live here, look at everything and feel wowed by it – which I still do, every day.I didn’t have a fantastic childhood. My mum died when I was six, of a brain tumour. TV was my escape. Every Saturday evening, I lost myself in classic American shows like The Dukes of Hazzard, The A Team, Knight Rider. Those 80s shows often visually referenced the 60s and Americana. There’s definitely a bit of nostalgia there.My interest in the 60s started with cars. I’ve always driven classic cars. I have a ’57 Chevy – it’s black with a red roof. I love that culture of hot rodding and classic cars. It’s linked together, my love of cars and interiors.Living in Scotland, you need a bit of colour, especially at this time of the year. I looked at Chevrolet paint charts from the 60s. The dining room is painted in a turquoise colour that came from those charts. The dining chairs are Panton and the side tables are Bauhaus.I wouldn’t want to live in the 60s. I’ve always believed that things tend to get better, although the last few years have stretched that for me. I guess I’m a traditional person in that I like to work hard and live quietly. But, beyond that, I don’t really relate to 60s values. My wife and I, we’re equals.I like to combine modern conveniences with 60s styling. I’ve incorporated automation into the house, so all our lighting themes come on automatically at different times of the day. We have sound systems in every room. I love gadgets. But I make sure they’re all invisible. I don’t want them to change the look of the house, just make it easier to live in.I love things with a history. We put in double doors that I got from a salvage yard between the dining room and the kitchen. They were from a cruise liner built in 1959. They add layers of history to the house. When you touch them, it feels like there’s a story behind them. Being able to keep things going and give them a new life, instead of throwing them in landfill, feels right to me.My dad was an antiques dealer and cabinet maker, so I grew up with mahogany furniture – lots of Edwardian pieces and William Morris. I used to go to auctions with my dad from the age of three or four. I’ve always hunted for stuff – when I was a student, I’d go around picking furniture out of skips. I’m such a Womble! Back then, people would toss out G Plan – no one wanted it.Everyone says to me: why the 70s? And I say: why not? It’s the colour, the shapes, the style. There’s some nostalgia there, too, because I’m just about old enough to remember the 70s. My grandparents kept all their 70s furniture well into the 80s. Back then, people bought quality and kept it for a long time, whereas now it feels as if everyone decorates their home at lightning speed to keep up with the latest Instagram trend. People treat their houses like fast fashion, whereas, 30 or 40 years ago, people had a style and stuck with it for 50 years.I have a Decca TV from the 70s that I found on Facebook Marketplace, three miles down the road. It’s ridiculous. The same model is on display in the Science Museum. It does turn on, but unfortunately the analogue signal was switched off in 2012, so I’m sending it to someone who specialises in making old appliances work on new systems. He’s going to make it compatible with Netflix and digital TV.I’m really tight. Everything is from Facebook Marketplace, car boot sales or eBay. I could go to specialist dealers, but I refuse to pay £300 for something I can find for £20 if I magpie about and keep looking. Sometimes, I’ll spend years looking for a specific piece. If I told you my search terms, I’d have to kill you. What I will say is that, if you want bargains, search broad. Type “coffee table” or “lamp”. It will take hours, but you’ll find gold for cheap.We have modern mattresses – I draw the line on that. And we have a modern TV. Oh, and a Dyson. Old vacuum cleaners are awful. My prized possession is a Marcel Breuer long chair. My dad had one when I was a kid, but he had to sell it in the 80s because he was short on money. Mine came up on eBay and the starting bid was £500. I had only £500 in my bank account, so I sat there shaking, waiting for the auction to run down. Then, with three seconds to go, I bid and won it. I felt sick. I cried and then called my dad.I wear 70s clothes, but not all the time. I’m a mum and I can’t swan around in a Jean Varon maxidress if there’s a four-year-old trying to smear yoghurt on me. Do I have vintage values? Absolutely not. I don’t sit about waiting for my partner to come home. I think a lot of things about the 70s were really bad. Thatcherism was shit, especially if you lived up north. If you watch Love Thy Neighbour, it’s so racist. If I had a time machine, I wouldn’t go back to the 70s. Actually – that’s a lie. I’d go back, stockpile a load of furniture and bring it back. But that’s about it.What I like the most about the 70s is the mindset. The roots of sustainable living started in the 70s. The quality of build and design is that much better. Nothing looks like it will fall apart in the next 10 minutes. There’s years of use left in this furniture. I’m so glad to be able to save it from landfill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fabd0e6c49a748b99617adc008548b1affbad85/0_85_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bc1248540ccca0c4c170e3cc4a1bb8a4","title":"from yemen to the uk noors story child marriage womens rights podcast","story":"A women’s rights activist tells the extraordinary story of how she fled Yemen after her life was threatened, and her devastation at having to leave her four children behind.

Noor was forced into marriage at the age of 14, but later managed to orce her husband.  She travelled alone with only smugglers and other desperate migrants for company on a terrifying eight-month journey to Britain.

She describes the devastating impact of leaving them behind. Her oldest daughter is at risk of child marriage in Yemen, and she says time is running out to bring her children to safety. Anushka also talks to the ’s Turkey and Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan, who examines why Yemen has been described as one of the worst places in the world to be a woman and how unusual and brave it is for a woman from such a country to embark on this kind of journey unaccompanied.

So we’re in this extraordinary situation … at least as serious, if not a more serious position than in March of last year, we’ve got less restrictions in place.”“I think we are going to have to look in the next 24 hours or so, what are the other measures that could be put in place, and hear from the scientists as to which of those that they think are more effective, and then all pull together and support those measures if they’re needed because the numbers are still, as everybody knows, heading in the wrong direction on.”In his first major policy speech, the Labour leader called for the government to give employers the right to put workers on “flexible furlough” to allow them to look after children while schools are closed, as well as extending support to the “excluded” 3 million workers who have no support.Starmer said the government was doing little to support working families who had to work full-time and homeschool their children during the national lockdown.He said Labour in power would pledge the creation of 400,000 jobs in low-carbon sectors – “because this recovery has to be a green recovery”. He also said a Labour government would create a “high streets fightback fund” to protect local shops and retail, saying “Britain can’t reopen if our towns and our high streets are closed”.Starmer said the government had not honoured its contract with the British people by failing to get the virus under control after many months of restrictions.“It makes no sense to me at all that when we’re asking so much of the British people, the government is doing so little to support families,” he said, calling for “a legal, enforceable and immediate right for parents to request paid, flexible furlough and by promoting that to all working parents to help them get through this lockdown”.In his speech, Starmer laid out a number of measures he said the government could take in order to ease the burden on working families and their finances. He said the government could cancel council tax hikes with more funding for local authorities – calling the rise “a £1.9bn bombshell that lands a bill of around £90 on every family”.He also urged the government to pull its plan to cut the £20 universal credit uplift, which was put in place at the start of the pandemic, but which the government plans to cut back in April. Starmer said that would be “taking £1,000 a year from millions of families and pulling another 200,000 children into poverty”.He also criticised the decision to freeze public-sector pay for millions of key workers, people, he said, who had “got us through this crisis – including our armed forces, our care workers, our teachers, our firefighters and police officers”.Starmer, who on Sunday said he believed lockdown measures might need to be tightened further, said the government had been “found wanting at every turn” during the crisis.“Even in the best of times, you can’t be indecisive in government. In the worst of times, indecision can be fatal. Every time there’s a big decision to make, Boris Johnson gets there too late,” he said.Starmer said the public needed to hear daily press conferences with the underlying message of “stay at home” and added: “One of the problems we’ve had in the last nine months is the mixed messaging coming from the government, this made it so much harder.

Its findings were passed to Police Scotland, which launched its own investigation.Salmond denied the allegations, resigned from the Scottish National party, and immediately took the Scottish government to court, accusing it of abuse of process.In January 2019, the court of session in Edinburgh ruled that the government inquiry was unlawful because the lead investigator had had prior contact with the complainers. Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary, admitted it was “tainted by apparent bias”.Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, admitted she spoke to Salmond about the government inquiry five times while it was under way, including meetings at her home. She failed to tell Evans she had done so until hours before her third conversation, potentially in breach of the ministerial code.A series of investigations was launched: Sturgeon referred herself under the ministerial code and the case was passed to James Hamilton QC, Ireland’s former director of public prosecutions the Scottish parliament appointed a special committee to investigate the government’s handling of the inquiry and Sturgeon’s actions and the government set up an internal review of its actions.Two weeks after winning his judicial review, Salmond appeared at Edinburgh sheriff court on 14 counts, including two of indecent assault, nine of sexual assault and two attempted rapes. He denied all the charges.In August 2019, the Scottish government paid Salmond £512,000 to cover his legal expenses for the judicial review. It later emerged that figure was so high because of serious procedural concerns about the government’s handling of his legal challenge.What happened at the Salmond trial?In March 2020, after nine days of evidence at the high court, Salmond was cleared of 14 charges – an attempted rape, one intent to rape, 11 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults, against 10 women. One charge was dropped by the crown the jury acquitted Salmond of all the others on majority verdicts.Salmond admitted in evidence that he had an extramarital “sexual liaison” with one of the complainers, but on a different date to the one alleged in the charges, and a “sleepy cuddle” with another which he soon apologised to her for. It emerged during the trial that a number of civil servants heard of two alleged incidents after the women involved told close colleagues.Once the trial ended, the Scottish parliament inquiry began to gather evidence.By the end of 2020, the Holyrood inquiry had held 10 oral evidence sessions, given under oath, including several with Leslie Evans, the permanent secretary the senior civil servants involved in drafting the sexual harassment policy used to investigate Salmond and the officials who carried out the inquiry. MSPs heard that officials were aware of unspecified rumours about Salmond, including alleged bullying.The government has released thousands of pages of evidence to the committee but MSPs have repeatedly accused ministers of breaching promises to do so quickly. After ministers repeatedly refused to release their legal advice on the Salmond case, Holyrood voted to insist it was handed over. The government has not given way, and the committee has only been allowed to see a summary of the advice.Salmond has told the ministerial code inquiry that Sturgeon misled Holyrood about what she knew and when, and is guilty of breaching the code. Sturgeon and Salmond are due to appear before MSPs on oath but the latest Covid lockdown has led to further delays. Sturgeon has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but said it is up to Holyrood and Hamilton to judge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92182a1cc4e457e3e0a80a4007665b1003872372/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=45e606e8dd2d94b1474e32ae3cf1586e","title":"have you had missed vaccination appointments in the uk","story":"We would like to hear from health professionals about people missing their appointments and how you are coping with rearranging themAt a Downing Street press conference last week, the prime minister said that by mid-January “it is our plan that everyone should have a vaccination available within a radius of 10 miles”.We would like to hear from GPs and healthcare professionals about their experiences of people missing vaccination appointments, and whether they have been able to rearrange them easily.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

It said: “Financial worries have been added to the general stress and anxiety of the pandemic for many families with children.”While higher-income groups were able to save money they would ordinarily have spent on commuting, eating out or holidays – and often spent this windfall on luxuries – those in the lowest income cohort often struggled to make ends meet, the study found.One woman interviewed for the research contrasted how rising food costs had eaten up “every penny of her savings”, while her better-off nephew “has been able to get his garden done with artificial grass and bought a hot tub with what he has saved”.One woman with children, living on on universal credit, told researchers: “The assumption is that spending has gone down. But that’s coming from the perspective of people who have disposable income … If you had no outgoings on luxuries like coffee shops, takeaway, clothes shopping, pubs, eating out etc, then nothing has been saved.”She added: “Our only saving has been £2.50 a week we spent on playgroup, and on petrol as we drive out to places less. On a whole we have seen our spending increase. Our electricity and gas bills have gone up for a start, as we’re at home more. We have spent a lot more on food, especially during the first lockdown when there were shortages and we had to buy expensive brands.”Many poorer families found the extra costs of feeding and entertaining children at home pushed up spending when schools closed, as did the need to equip school-age sons and daughters with laptops and broadband access for online learning.Normal coping strategies employed by poorer families – visiting friends and families for occasional meals, or using the library for free internet access, and charity shops for cheap clothes – became harder as a result of household mixing restrictions and the closure of libraries and non-essential retail.The study incorporates research by the Nuffield Foundation-funded Covid Realities project, which has tracked the experiences of low-income families and carers over the course of the pandemic as well as surveys of 6,000 UK adults in May and September.Dr Ruth Patrick, a lecturer in social policy at the University of York, who leads the Covid Realities research programme said: “While the need for the lockdown is clear, there is an equally urgent need to address the additional financial pressures that families on a low-income face through greater income support to families with dependent children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/560ed6c400d3e49ef5b4715293060a6a0d7f9bc2/672_0_1938_1163/master/1938.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0c9ca709b0d11c88ee7bff1771fb528d","title":"what bitcoin why many people buy cryptocurrency financial regulator","story":"Cryptocurrency is attracting attention from investors and financial regulators alikeBitcoin is a type of digital currency that emerged after the 2008 financial crisis. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods. It has become the most prominent among thousands of so-called cryptocurrencies.It relies on “blockchain” technology, which is a shared database of transactions, with entries that must be confirmed and encrypted. The network is secured by iniduals called “miners” who use high-powered computers to verify transactions, with bitcoins offered as a reward. There are more than 18m in existence, and the mathematical system controlling the generation of new bitcoins – which is decentralised and therefore has no overarching institution such as a central bank – has a hardwired maximum of 21m coins.There are several currency exchanges where consumers can swap traditional “fiat” money – backed by governments – for cryptocurrencies, which must be stored using a digital wallet. Some of the biggest exchanges include Bitstamp, Coinbase and Gemini. However, finance firms have also created new investment products based on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as contracts for difference, which are used to track the value of an asset without needing to directly own it.There are problems when it comes to using bitcoin as a currency, with many people simply owning it as a speculative investment instead, given its tendency for extreme swings in value.Within the space of a single hour on Monday alone, its value fell by about $3,000 (£2,230), then rose again by about $2,000. This makes it almost impossible to put a reliable price on goods and services.Instead, there are ways to pay using applications such as BitPay, which converts bitcoin funds in a digital wallet to pay for goods in traditional currencies used by retailers. Transactions are growing, more so online than in physical shops, with firms including Microsoft, Lush and Expedia accepting payments. The first-ever bitcoin transaction was made in 2010, when a Florida man paid a British man 10,000 bitcoins to order him two Papa John’s pizzas. Today that would be worth more than $300m.The City regulator is concerned crypto investment firms could be overstating potential payouts, or understating the risks, from investing in bitcoin and products related to the digital currency.As a newer and relatively lightly regulated market, consumers are unlikely to have access to state-backed compensation if something goes wrong. There has also been a boom in bitcoin scams.There are three main factors influencing the bitcoin price. First, the media frenzy over its boom in value, drawing in new buyers looking to make money. Second, more traditional finance firms are investing in the market. And finally, comparisons between bitcoin and gold, which fit with trends in the global economy.The development of Covid-19 vaccines could enable a swift economic recovery from the pandemic, at a time when governments and central banks are still providing vast amounts of emergency support – which could trigger a burst of inflation. Some investors view bitcoin as a store of value, similar to gold, which can hold its worth during times of economic stress or rising inflation.Bitcoin’s value is almost entirely defined by perceptions. Some economists believe it is entirely worthless. However, analysts at JP Morgan have said it could hit $146,000 if it became as established as gold for investors. However, to match this reputation built up over millennia – as a thing worth owning, with otherwise little intrinsic value – it would need to become much less volatile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41645413df9103eff7163d80f87b6cb48cdfd942/0_348_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9f1646fd0629eaac0ee1fa2f91b5e22c","title":"10 best virtual travel experiences 2021 film festivals street tours wine tasting","story":"Travel the world through this new crop of virtual experiences, from online guide walks to film festivals, wine-tasting to birdwatchingOn a virtual trip to Helsinki, Intrepid tour leader Kati Pankka will guide you around a private lakeside sauna.

If parents feel their child’s school is not providing suitable remote education they should first raise their concerns with the teacher or headteacher and, failing that, report the matter to Ofsted.”There have been concerns about patchy remote provision since the pandemic began last year, but Richard Brown, headteacher of the Urswick school in Hackney, north-east London spoke for many in the sector when he said of Williamson’s comments: “What an absolute kick in the teeth.”By Friday, according to Schools Week around 5,000 emails had been sent to Ofsted’s general enquiries inbox, which normally deals with safeguarding concerns, questions about how to register as a child minder and complaints about schools. By Monday that had more than doubled and additional staff may have to be brought in to deal with the backlog. Ofsted declined to comment.It coincided with new Ofsted guidance on remote learning, which advised that live online lessons - frequently held up as the gold standard during lockdown - were not always the best way to deliver remote education and that sometimes text books and worksheets might be more effective.The guidance also found that pupils using a laptop tended to spend longer accessing a remote lesson than those using a phone or tablet. “This means that we need to think carefully about whether pupils have access to the right kind of device when we’re using digital remote education. If they don’t, and we can’t provide enough devices, it might be better to consider non-digital approaches as well,” said Daniel Muijs, Ofsted’s deputy director, research and evaluation.Ofsted will resume on-site monitoring inspections of schools currently judged inadequate or requiring improvement from next week, though grades will not be issued, and inspectors will be expected to assess the remote education on offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f81c02e6ca53caaa9de2fb63d0bd77bdc66bd71e/0_143_2119_1272/master/2119.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2f972dfccf6b0e43b5d1535c93fe8e74","title":"uighur xinjiang re education camp china gulbahar haitiwaji","story":"After 10 years living in France, I returned to China to sign some papers and I was locked up. For the next two years, I was systematically dehumanised, humiliated and brainwashedby  Gulbahar Haitiwaji with  Rozenn MorgatThe man on the phone said he worked for the oil company, “In accounting, actually”. His voice was unfamiliar to me. At first, I couldn’t make sense of what he was calling about. It was November 2016, and I had been on unpaid leave from the company since I left China and moved to France 10 years earlier. There was static on the line I had a hard time hearing him.“You must come back to Karamay to sign documents concerning your forthcoming retirement, Madame Haitiwaji,” he said. Karamay was the city in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang where I’d worked for the oil company for more than 20 years.“In that case, I’d like to grant power of attorney,” I said. “A friend of mine in Karamay takes care of my administrative affairs. Why should I come back for some paperwork? Why go all that way for such a trifle? Why now?”The man had no answers for me. He simply said he would call me back in two days after looking into the possibility of letting my friend act on my behalf.My husband, Kerim, had left Xinjiang in 2002 to look for work. He tried first in Kazakhstan, but came back disillusioned after a year. Then in Norway. Then France, where he had applied for asylum. Once he was settled there, our two girls and I would join him.Kerim had always known he would leave Xinjiang. The idea had taken root even before we were hired by the oil company. We had met as students in Urumqi, the largest city in Xinjiang province, and, as new graduates, had begun looking for work. This was in 1988. In the job ads in the newspapers, there was often a little phrase in small print: No Uighurs. This never left him. While I tried to overlook the evidence of discrimination that followed us everywhere, with Kerim, it became an obsession.After graduation, we were offered jobs as engineers at the oil company in Karamay. We were lucky. But then there was the red envelope episode. At lunar new year, when the boss handed out the annual bonuses, the red envelopes given to Uighur workers contained less than those given to our colleagues who belonged to China’s dominant ethnic group, the Han. Soon after, all the Uighurs were transferred out of the central office and moved to the outskirts of town. A small group objected, but I didn’t dare. A few months later, when a senior position came up, Kerim applied. He had the right qualifications and the seniority. There was no reason he shouldn’t get the position. But the post went to an employee who belonged to a Han worker who didn’t even have an engineering degree. One night in 2000, Kerim came home and announced that he had quit. “I’ve had enough,” he said.What my husband was experiencing was all too familiar. Since 1955, when communist China annexed Xinjiang as an “autonomous region”, we Uighurs have been seen as a thorn in the side of the Middle Kingdom. Xinjiang is a strategic corridor and far too valuable for China’s ruling Communist party to risk losing control of it. The party has invested too much in the “new silk road”, the infrastructure project designed to link China to Europe via central Asia, of which our region is an important axis. Xinjiang is essential to President Xi Jinping’s great plan – that is, a peaceful Xinjiang, open for business, cleansed of its separatist tendencies and its ethnic tensions. In short, Xinjiang without Uighurs.My daughters and I fled to France to join my husband in May 2006, just before Xinjiang entered an unprecedented period of repression. My daughters, 13 and 8 at the time, were given refugee status, as was their father. In seeking asylum, my husband had made a clean break with the past. Obtaining a French passport in effect stripped him of his Chinese nationality. For me, the prospect of turning in my passport held a terrible implication: I would never be able to return to Xinjiang. How could I ever say goodbye to my roots, to the loved ones I’d left behind – my parents, my brothers and sisters, their children? I imagined my mother, getting on in years, dying alone in her village in the northern mountains. Giving up my Chinese nationality meant giving up on her, too. I couldn’t bring myself to do it. So instead, I’d applied for a residence permit that was renewable every 10 years.After the phone call, my head was buzzing with questions as I looked around the quiet living room of our apartment in Boulogne. Why did that man want me to go back to Karamay? Was it a ploy so the police could interrogate me? Nothing like this had happened to any of the other Uighurs I knew in France.The man called back two days later. “Granting power of attorney will not be possible, Madame Haitiwaji. You must come to Karamay in person.” I gave in. After all, it was only a matter of a few documents.“Fine. I’ll be there as soon as I can,” I said.When I hung up, a shiver ran down my spine. I dreaded going back to Xinjiang. Kerim had been doing his best to reassure me for two days now, but I had a bad feeling about it. At this time of year, Karamay city was in the grip of a brutal winter. Gusts of icy wind howled down the avenues, between the shops, houses and apartment buildings. A few bundled-up figures braved the elements, hugging the walls, but on the whole, there was not a soul to be seen. But what I feared most of all were the ever-stricter measures regulating Xinjiang. Anyone who set foot outside their home could be arrested for no reason at all.That wasn’t new, but the despotism had become more pronounced since the Urumqi riots in 2009, an explosion of violence between the city’s Uighur and Han populations, which left 197 people dead. The event marked a turning point in the recent history of the region. Later, the Chinese Communist party would blame the entire ethnic group for these horrible acts, justifying its repressive policies by claiming that Uighur households were a hotbed of radical Islam and separatism.The summer of 2016 saw the entrance of a significant new player in the long struggle between our ethnic group and the Communist party. Chen Quanguo, who had made his reputation imposing draconian surveillance measures in Tibet, was named head of Xinjiang province. With his arrival, the repression of Uighurs escalated dramatically. Thousands were sent to “schools” built almost overnight in the middle of the desert. These were known as “transformation through education” camps. Detainees were sent there to be brainwashed – and worse.I didn’t want to go back, but all the same, I decided Kerim was right: there was no reason for me to worry. The trip would only take a few weeks. “They’ll definitely pull you in for questioning, but don’t panic. That’s completely normal,” he reassured me.A few days after I landed in China, on the morning of 30 November 2016, I went to the oil company office in Karamay to sign the vaunted documents related to my upcoming retirement. In the office with its flaking walls sat the accountant, a sour-voiced Han, and his secretary, hunched behind a screen.The next stage took place in Kunlun police station, a 10-minute drive from the company head office. On the way, I prepared my answers to the questions I was likely to be asked. I tried to steel myself. After leaving my belongings at the front desk, I was led to a narrow, soulless room: the interrogation room. I’d never been in one before. A table separated the policemen’s two chairs from my own. The quiet hum of the heater, the poorly cleaned whiteboard, the pallid lighting: these set the scene. We discussed the reasons I left for France, my jobs at a bakery and a cafeteria in the business district of Paris, La Défense.Then one of the officers shoved a photo under my nose. It made my blood boil. It was a face I knew as well as my own – those full cheeks, that slender nose. It was my daughter Gulhumar. She was posing in front of the Place du Trocadéro in Paris, bundled up in her black coat, the one I’d given her. In the photo, she was smiling, a miniature East Turkestan flag in her hand, a flag the Chinese government had banned. To Uighurs, that flag symbolises the region’s independence movement. The occasion was one of the demonstrations organised by the French branch of the World Uighur Congress, which represents Uighurs in exile and speaks out against Chinese repression in Xinjiang.Whether you’re politicised or not, such gatherings in France are above all a chance for the community to get together, much like birthdays, Eid and the spring festival of Nowruz. You can go to protest repression in Xinjiang, but also, as Gulhumar did, to see friends and catch up with the community of exiles. At the time, Kerim was a frequent attender. The girls went once or twice. I never did. Politics isn’t my thing. Since leaving Xinjiang, I’d only grown less interested.Suddenly, the officer slammed his fist on the table.“You know her, don’t you?”“Yes. She’s my daughter.”“No. I don’t know why she was at that demonstration.”I kept repeating, “I don’t know, I don’t know what she was doing there, she wasn’t doing anything wrong, I swear! My daughter is not a terrorist! Neither is my husband!”I can’t remember the rest of the interrogation. All I remember is that photo, their aggressive questions, and my futile replies. I don’t know how long it went on for. I remember that when it was over, I said, irritably: “Can I go now? Are we done here?” Then one of them said: “No, Gulbahar Haitiwaji, we’re not done.”‘Right! Left! At ease!” There were 40 of us in the room, all women, wearing blue pyjamas. It was a nondescript rectangular classroom. A big metal shutter, perforated with tiny holes that let the light in, hid the outside world from us. Eleven hours a day, the world was reduced to this room. Our slippers squeaked on linoleum. Two Han soldiers relentlessly kept time as we marched up and down the room. This was called “physical education”. In reality, it was tantamount to military training.Our exhausted bodies moved through the space in unison, back and forth, side to side, corner to corner. When the soldier bellowed “At ease!” in Mandarin, our regiment of prisoners froze. He ordered us to remain still. This could last half an hour, or just as often a whole hour, or even more. When it did, our legs began to prickle all over with pins and needles. Our bodies, still warm and restless, struggled not to sway in the moist heat. We could smell our own foul breath. We were panting like cattle. Sometimes, one or another of us would faint. If she didn’t come round, a guard would yank her to her feet and slap her awake. If she collapsed again, he would drag her out of the room, and we’d never see her again. Ever. At first, this shocked me, but now I was used to it. You can get used to anything, even horror.It was now June 2017, and I’d been here for three days. After almost five months in the Karamay police cells, between interrogations and random acts of cruelty – at one stage I was chained to my bed for 20 days as punishment, though I never knew what for – I was told I would be going to “school”. I had never heard of these mysterious schools, or the courses they offered. The government has built them to “correct” Uighurs, I was told. The women who shared my cell said it would be like a normal school, with Han teachers. She said that once we had passed, the students would be free to go home.This “school” was in Baijiantan, a district on the outskirts of Karamay. After leaving the police cells, that was all the information I’d managed to glean, from a sign stuck in a dried ditch where a few empty plastic bags were drifting about. Apparently, the training was to last a fortnight. After that, the classes on theory would begin. I didn’t know how I was going to hold out. How had I not broken down already? Baijiantan was a no man’s land from which three buildings rose, each the size of a small airport. Beyond the barbed-wire fence, there was nothing but desert as far as the eye could see.On my first day, female guards led me to a dormitory full of beds, mere planks of numbered wood. There was already another woman there: Nadira, Bunk No 8. I was assigned Bunk No 9.Nadira showed me around the dormitory, which had the heady smell of fresh paint: the bucket for doing your business, which she kicked wrathfully the window with its metal shutter always closed the two cameras panning back and forth in high corners of the room. That was it. No mattress. No furniture. No toilet paper. No sheets. No sink. Just two of us in the gloom and the bang of heavy cell doors slamming shut.This was no school. It was a re-education camp, with military rules, and a clear desire to break us. Silence was enforced, but, physically taxed to the limit, we no longer felt like talking anyway. Over time, our conversations dwindled. Our days were punctuated by the screech of whistles on waking, at mealtime, at bedtime. Guards always had an eye on us there was no way to escape their watchfulness, no way to whisper, wipe your mouth, or yawn for fear of being accused of praying. It was against the rules to turn down food, for fear of being called an “Islamist terrorist”. The wardens claimed our food was halal.At night, I collapsed on my bunk in a stupor. I had lost all sense of time. There was no clock. I guessed at the time of day from how cold or hot it felt. The guards terrified me. We hadn’t seen daylight since we arrived – all the windows were blocked by those damned metal shutters. We were surrounded by desert as far as the eye could see. Though one of the policemen had promised I’d be given a phone, I hadn’t been. Who knew I was being held here? Had my sister been notified, or Kerim and Gulhumar? It was a waking nightmare. Beneath the impassive gaze of the security cameras, I couldn’t even open up to my fellow detainees. I was tired, so tired. I couldn’t even think any more.The camp was a vast labyrinth where guards led us around in groups by dormitory. To go to the showers, the bathroom, the classroom, or the canteen, we were escorted down a series of endless fluorescent-lit hallways. Even a moment’s privacy was impossible. At either end of the hallways, automatic security doors sealed off the maze like airlocks. One thing was for sure: everything here was new. The reek of paint from the spotless walls was a constant reminder. It seemed like the premises of a factory, but I didn’t yet have a handle on just how big it was.The sheer number of guards and other female prisoners we passed as we were moved around led me to believe this camp was massive. Every day, I saw new faces, zombie-like, with bags under the eyes. By the end of the first day, there had been seven of us in our cell after three days there were 12. A little quick maths: I’ve counted 16 cell groups, including mine, each with 12 bunks, full up … that made for almost 200 detainees at Baijiantan. Two hundred women torn from their families. Two hundred lives locked up until further notice. And the camp just kept filling up.You could tell the new arrivals from their distraught faces. They still tried to meet your eyes in the hallway. The ones who’d been there longer looked down at their feet. They shuffled around in close ranks, like robots. They snapped to attention without batting an eye, when a whistle ordered them to. Good God, what had been done to make them that way?I’d thought the theory classes would bring us a bit of relief from the physical training, but they were even worse. The teacher was always watching us, and slapped us every chance she got. One day, one of my classmates, a woman in her 60s, shut her eyes, surely from exhaustion or fear. The teacher gave her a brutal slap. “Think I don’t see you praying? You’ll be punished!” The guards dragged her violently from the room. An hour later, she came back with something she had written: her self-criticism. The teacher made her read it out loud to us. She obeyed, ashen-faced, then sat down again. All she’d done was shut her eyes.After a few days, I understood what people meant by “brainwashing”. Every morning, a Uighur instructor would come into our silent classroom. A woman of our own ethnicity, teaching us how to be Chinese. She treated us like wayward citizens that the party had to re-educate. I wondered what she thought of all this. Did she think anything at all? Where was she from? How had she ended up here? Had she herself been re-educated before doing this work?At her signal, we all stood up as one. “Lao shi hao!” This greeting to the teacher kicked off 11 hours of daily teaching. We recited a kind of pledge of allegiance to China: “Thank you to our great country. Thank you to our party. Thank you to our dear President Xi Jinping.” In the evening, a similar version ended the lesson: “I wish for my great country to develop and have a bright future. I wish for all ethnicities to form a single great nation. I wish good health to President Xi Jinping. Long live President Xi Jinping.”Glued to our chairs, we repeated our lessons like parrots. They taught us the glorious history of China – a sanitised version, cleansed of abuses. On the cover of the manual we were given was inscribed “re-education programme”. It contained nothing but stories of the powerful dynasties and their glorious conquests, and the great achievements of the Communist party. It was even more politicised and biased than the teaching at Chinese universities. In the early days, it made me laugh. Did they really think they were going to break us with a few pages of propaganda?But as the days went by, fatigue set in like an old enemy. I was exhausted, and my firm resolve to resist was on permanent hold. I tried not to give in, but school went steamrolling on. It rolled right over our aching bodies. So this was brainwashing – whole days spent repeating the same idiotic phrases. As if that weren’t enough, we had to do an hour of extra study after dinner in the evening before going to bed. We would review our endlessly repeated lessons one last time. Every Friday, we had an oral and written test. By turns, beneath the wary eye of the camp leaders, we would recite the communist stew we’d been served up.In this way, our short-term memory became both our greatest ally and our worst enemy. It enabled us to absorb and regurgitate volumes of history and declarations of loyal citizenship, so we could avoid the public humiliation dished out by the teacher. But at the same time, it weakened our critical abilities. It took away the memories and thoughts that bind us to life. After a while I could no longer picture clearly the faces of Kerim and my daughters. We were worked until we were nothing more than dumb animals. No one told us how long this would go on.How even to begin the story of what I went through in Xinjiang? How to tell my loved ones that I lived at the mercy of police violence, of Uighurs like me who, because of the status their uniforms gave them, could do as they wished with us, our bodies and souls? Of men and women whose brains had been thoroughly washed – robots stripped of humanity, zealously enforcing orders, petty bureaucrats working under a system in which those who do not denounce others are themselves denounced, and those who do not punish others are themselves punished. Persuaded that we were enemies to be beaten down – traitors and terrorists – they took away our freedom. They locked us up like animals somewhere away from the rest of the world, out of time: in camps.In the “transformation-through-education” camps, life and death do not mean the same thing as they do elsewhere. A hundred times over I thought, when the footfalls of guards woke us in the night, that our time had come to be executed. When a hand viciously pushed clippers across my skull, and other hands snatched away the tufts of hair that fell on my shoulders, I shut my eyes, blurred with tears, thinking my end was near, that I was being readied for the scaffold, the electric chair, drowning. Death lurked in every corner. When the nurses grabbed my arm to “vaccinate” me, I thought they were poisoning me. In reality, they were sterilising us. That was when I understood the method of the camps, the strategy being implemented: not to kill us in cold blood, but to make us slowly disappear. So slowly that no one would notice.We were ordered to deny who we were. To spit on our own traditions, our beliefs. To criticise our language. To insult our own people. Women like me, who emerged from the camps, are no longer who we once were. We are shadows our souls are dead. I was made to believe that my loved ones, my husband and my daughter, were terrorists. I was so far away, so alone, so exhausted and alienated, that I almost ended up believing it. My husband, Kerim, my daughters Gulhumar and Gulnigar – I denounced your “crimes”. I begged forgiveness from the Communist party for atrocities that neither you nor I committed. I regret everything I said that dishonoured you. Today I am alive, and I want to proclaim the truth. I don’t know if you will accept me, I don’t know if you’ll forgive me.How can I begin to tell you what happened here?I was held in the camp at Baijiantan for two years. During that time, everyone around me – the police officers who came to interrogate prisoners, plus the guards, teachers and tutors – tried to make me believe the massive lie without which China could not have justified its re-education project: that Uighurs are terrorists, and thus that I, Gulbahar, as a Uighur who had been living in exile in France for 10 years, was a terrorist. Wave after wave of propaganda crashed down upon me, and as the months went by, I began to lose part of my sanity. Bits of my soul shattered and broke off. I will never recover them.During violent interrogations by the police, I kowtowed under the blows – so much so that I even made false confessions. They managed to convince me that the sooner I owned up to my crimes, the sooner I’d be able to leave. Exhausted, I finally gave in. I had no other choice. No one can fight against themselves for ever. No matter how tirelessly you battle brainwashing, it does its insidious work. All desire and passion desert you. What options do you have left? A slow, painful descent into death, or submission. If you play at submission, if you feign losing your psychological power struggle against the police, then at least, despite it all, you hang on to the shard of lucidity that reminds you who you are.I didn’t believe a word of what I was saying to them. I simply did my best to be a good actor.On 2 August 2019, after a short trial, before an audience of just a few people, a judge from Karamay pronounced me innocent. I barely heard his words. I listened to the sentence as if it were nothing to do with me. I was thinking about all the times I had asserted my innocence, all those nights I had tossed and turned on my bunk, enraged that no one would believe me. And I was thinking about all those other times when I had admitted the things they accused me of, all the fake confessions I had made, all those lies.They had sentenced me to seven years of re-education. They had tortured my body and brought my mind to the edge of madness. And now, after reviewing my case, a judge had decided that no, in actual fact, I was innocent. I was free to go. • Some names have been changed. Translated by Edward Gauvin.

Scientists want to determine how the virus jumped species into humans. A year into the pandemic there are still many unanswered questions over the origins of the novel virus.  ’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, tells Rachel Humpheys about what the WHO has uncovered over the past 12 months and the challenges it has faced. Ideally, door-to-door detective work, talking to the first people to fall ill and their families and colleagues, would have begun in Wuhan in January. But the city was in lockdown, its streets deserted. And the rest of the world had not yet understood what it was facing, Bruce Aylward, the Canadian doctor and epidemiologist appointed by WHO to lead its fact-finding mission to China in early February told Sarah in a recent phone call.  Now, Sarah says, the team tasked with the latest investigation has an even greater task on its hands as the lapse in time will make it harder to track down certain clues that might help answer where the pandemic started. It’s crucial we find these answers however, not only to deal with this pandemic, but to stop something like this happening again.

Photograph: GettyThe Leaving Certificate is often held up as the fairest way of deciding who goes to college. After all, doesn’t every student sit the same exam, all marked anonymously to the same standard?But this overlooks a key point: while everyone does indeed sit the same set of exams, they don’t do so on a level playing field.Students from disadvantaged backgrounds remain significantly under-represented in third level, with a recent study from the Higher Education Authority showing that students from affluent backgrounds dominate high-points college courses such as engineering, finance and medicine.When students come from communities without a strong tradition of college-going, when they can’t afford grinds, when they don’t have as much space to study at home, or where they may be helping to care for parents or siblings with a disability, it’s hard to do as well in the exams as students in families who expect their children to go to college and can invest significant time and resources in helping them to get there.Students with disabilities also face additional hurdles in getting through an education system that is inherently designed for people with good hearing and sight, that is focused on written exams and particular learning styles and that is predicated on years of studying and working using tools that able-bodied students can easily use. Students with disabilities are also more likely to live in families with financial struggles.But there is support to level the playing field and help address these imbalances. Dare (Disability Access Route to Education) and Hear (Higher Education Access Route) are not programmes in themselves but instead are admissions routes into college for, respectively, students with disabilities or students attending designated disadvantaged (Deis) schools.Anna Kelly, director of access and lifelong learning at UCD, says that teachers and guidance counsellors will help inform and advise students on how to apply through the Hear and Dare processes. “You apply through the CAO form by ticking a box indicating that you want to be considered as part of Hear or Dare. It’s integrated into the CAO application process and we have a communications programme that helps students, families, teachers and higher-education institutions complete the application process. Students who have disabilities and come from a disadvantaged background can apply through both processes.”Third-level institutions differ in how many places they reserve for Hear and Dare applicants, and it’s worth pointing out that not all students with disabilities or from disadvantaged backgrounds necessarily apply through those access routes.College Connect is a partnership between Athlone Institute of Technology, Dundalk Institute of Technology, DCU and Maynooth University to reach under-represented students and connect them to higher education courses, including Travellers, lone parents, students from one-parent families, young people who have just left care, students with disabilities, ex-prisoners, protection applicants, mature students and disadvantaged students.“Education changes lives, but the reality is that getting to college is much more difficult for some than it is for others,” says Ayoma Bowe, communications officer at College Connect. “College Connect was set up to speak directly to people and communities who face barriers, and to show them pathways to and through college. Student ersity is not only fair, it broadens the perspectives of colleges as whole, and we’re here to help people facing multiple challenges to make that first step.”For more information, see AccessCollege.ie.“I grew up in disadvantaged areas, where there weren’t many opportunities for young people, and education wasn’t pushed on us.“I applied for computer science at Maynooth University, and worked for a year before setting foot on the campus. College appealed to me because playing GAA and soccer had made me want to be the best version of myself and to keep moving forward.“Maynooth has a financial adviser to help make your money go further and they’re always there if we need financial aid or help with accommodation. It can be harder if you’re the first in your family to go to third level, but I’ve never felt like a fish out of water there.“I’m now in my final year studying computer science. It has been challenging with Covid-19 but it’s also been a learning process. I think education is key. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing as long as the goal is to be the best version of yourself. It doesn’t have to be university – it could be a trade or further education – but find something you are interested in and keeping learning.”Aoife McCabe, Royal College of Surgeons Ireland “When transitioning from secondary school to college I was concerned about how my visual impairment may impact my learning. I needn’t have worried. From the moment I set foot in RCSI, every effort has been made to accommodate me. I feel completely comfortable raising any concerns or difficulties or concerns I may have, and I know every effort will be made to come up with a solution.“As a visually impaired student the small campus size was really important to me because I didn’t want the hassle of trying to find my way around a huge campus where I’d easily get lost. With the central location of the St Stephen’s Green campus, the longest journey I have to make in college involves popping across the road.“The support I receive from my personal tutor, the academic development team, the practice education co-ordinators and the entire school of physio means I can concentrate on my studies rather than worrying about my eyesight.“I’m in my third year of physiotherapy now and I’m extremely happy with my choice. I’ve made friends for life here and, while we can’t quite socialise like we used to, we still manage to have fun in lectures and practicals.”– Students apply to Hear and Dare through the CAO and are eligible for entry on a reduced number of Leaving Certificate points. In 2020, 61 per cent of Hear applicants met the eligibility criteria, compared with 54 per cent in 2010.– Like all other CAO applicants, Hear and Dare applicants receive a level-eight and a level-sixseven offer.– Research shows that students with disabilities who are also from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds face the greatest obstacles in college.– The number of applications to Dare grew by 7.5 per cent between 2019 and 2020.– All 25 participating higher-education institutions reserve a minimum of 5 per cent of their places for reduced-points offers for each of Dare and Hear.– In 2020, almost one in five students who applied to CAO were assessed for Dare and or Hear eligibility, with 11,576 places offered to these applicants across the entire Irish higher-education sector.(Information from the Irish Universities Association DareHear summary report 2020, UCD, TU Dublin, NUI Galway and RCSI.)"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4433106.1607691913!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how much is the cost of living for first year students","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents should shop around for the best mobile phone and wifi deals. Photograph: Getty ImagesiStockEvery year, The  asks third-level institutions to provide us with a cost-of-living guide for incoming first-year students. Because of the impact of Covid-19 and Brexit – and the fallout that is yet to fully settle – these figures will have changed by September 2021.However, current information from Jennifer Farrell, head of student administration at Technological University (TU) Dublin, shows the overall cost of living away from home has dropped for the first time in a decade. It’s down from €12,171 to €11,948.25 due to lower phone costs and less social activities because of Covid.– Full term from €125 to €235 per week, inclusive of utilities.– Three-night stay from €117 to €180 per week, inclusive of utilities.– From €110 per week, depending on the accommodation package offered.The cost of renting fell slightly in Dublin during the pandemic but rose by about 5 per cent in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford cities. By September 2021, new student accommodation blocks should see an increase in available accommodation and a decrease in rents.Class materialsStudents have had to purchase laptops and, in many cases, get broadband packages that are more expensive in rural areas. The average cost of a laptop is €650 and, with blended learning here to stay, it is a cost most first years in 2021 will need to consider.Average wifi cost is €30 per month but many had to pay installation costs of about €120.Living at homeStudents living at home have generally not had to pay for food and accommodation and have also saved on travel. However, they may have missed out on work due to the closure of retail and hospitality businesses throughout the Covid-19 crisis.TU Dublin’s campus life office puts the cost of living at home in 2020-2021 at €330 per month. But with the vaccine rolling out and students expected back on campus in the next academic year, travel, food, stationary, entertainment and socialising costs – and students will be itching to make up for lost time – are likely to increase and that figure may double from 2021."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4444656.1608724979!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"key dates for 2021 cao applications","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKeep note of all important dates in the 2020 college application process.

File photograph: GettyThe 2021 college application season is likely to be like nothing we have experienced previously.As in previous years, the majority of Central Applications Office hopefuls are those due to complete the Leaving Cert this summer.These students have already missed three months of tuition in the last academic year and with the majority of schools to remain closed until at least the end of the month remote-learning is likely to continue as the main mechanism for educational delivery for the foreseeable future.To-date schools have done an amazing job in keeping tuition going under radically changed circumstances and will continue to do so if required.While many students will be hoping for a quick return to classes and uninterrupted face-to-face tuition until June 2021, uncertainty remains.The good news is that the system can at least draw on its experience of 2020 to deal with any further disruption caused by the pandemic.Exam changes Last week, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the Government would focus on how special needs and vulnerable students will be supported while schools remain closed.He added that a decision on whether the Leaving Cert in 2021 would go ahead in the traditional format needed to be approached “in a calm and judicious manner”.The Department of Education has already informed students and teachers of changes to the examination format, arising from the loss of tuition time in the springtime.Are we likely to see a continuation of the calculated grades process and if so, what implication will this have for the rest of the Leaving Cert cycle?Will this have a knock-on effect on results and therefore CAO points scored achieved in 2021?Alternative arrangements have already been made for the Health Professions Admission Test (HPat), which has been used for some years now as part of the entry procedures for undergraduate medical entry.The deadline for registration HPat is 5.15pm on January 20th.The exam will take place online via online proctoring (monitored by camera at all times before and during the test) from applicants’ homes on Saturday, 21st or Sunday 22nd February 2021.Administrators of third-level courses that require a portfolio and face-to-face assessment as part of the application process are reflecting on how to manage these in a Covid-19 safe way.Can portfolio materials be transferred safely from students to colleges for assessment? Again, how will this affect entry requirements into these “restricted application” programmes?Amid all of this uncertainty, CAO applicants still have to assess which courses to apply for in 2021. Part of this has always involved evaluating what the CAO points requirement might be.If, as is now looking increasingly likely, the extra 2,245 additional places created in 2020 are retained this year, what impact will they have on the entry requirements?Would the 2020 points requirements which arose from the calculated grades process then be an accurate guide as to what applicants might expect in 2021?With the impetus created by the establishment of the new Department of Higher and Further Education, will the retention of these places, in addition to an expected 2,700 undergraduate college places planned to address demographic growth pressures, ease those entry requirements this AugustSeptember?As is usually the case every year, up to 10,000 applicants from previous years are expected apply for CAO college places in 2021.How many of these previous Leaving Cert applicants will carry points from the 2020 calculated grades process, which were 10 per cent higher than previous years at higher level papers?Will this cohort of applicants with their higher points scores push up the entry requirements for this year’s Leaving Certs in 2021?Notwithstanding the Common Travel Area , what will the effect of Brexit be on the fees charged to Republic of Ireland students in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where they have paid far lower fees in recent years than the €9,250 charged to Irish students in England?Will these changes put additional pressures on our colleges, if students who previously would have accepted places offered through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) decide to remain at home in 2021?As the only English-speaking European Union country other than Malta in the community, will there be a growth in applications from other member states who want to be educated through English, who might previously have applied for places in UK universities? Will that put pressure on our CAO points system?Continental colleges We need to be aware that all EU students have the same entitlement to apply for places in Irish colleges as Irish students.Alternatively, as many EU colleges have switched their tuition to English over the past 10 years, will we continue to see the near doubling annually of Irish student numbers deciding to seek and accept places in continental EU colleges?With fees costing about €2,000 per year in the Netherlands and totally free in many other western European countries, will these growing numbers of Irish students travelling to Europe take some of the pressure off CAO points, as the additional 50,000 students pass through the second-level system in the coming five to six years?All of these questions will be played out and should be resolved as the year progresses.All that those seeking college places can do for the moment is to explore the courses on offer in Ireland through the CAO and in further education colleges, through Ucas in the UK and Northern Ireland, or through eunicas.ie in European Uni- versities and those further afield.In the fullness of time, when the Leaving Cert process is completed in late June 2021, students will then have the opportunity to finalise their domestic Irish college choices.Then come August they will have the widest range of course choices available when they get the results of this year’s Leaving Cert, or alternate assessment process, if Covid-19 were to cause similar problems in 2021 to those caused in 2020."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4434000.1607691358!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"six steps to applying for college in 2021","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe first step to take towards third level is  to register your intention to seek a CAO college place immediately. Photograph: Getty Images 1: Register with CAO. ieJanuary 2021 – If you are interested in getting a place at an Irish university, institute of technology (IT), teacher-training college or private college where places are offered through the CAO application process, go to cao.ie by January 20th and make an application, paying €30 by credit or debit card. After January 20th and until February 1st, the fee rises to €45.All the CAO wants at this stage are your personal details including your name, address, phone number, any disability or specific learning difficulty, country of birth, nationality, email address, payment details and details of any post-second-level course (PLC) or other qualifications you have.When you have done this, you will get your CAO identification number. From this point onwards, you may indicate which courses you wish to be considered for next September.However, you have the freedom to leave it for now and return to your application in May or June to list or amend your course choices up until the July 1st deadline. The most comprehensive source of information on courses is on qualifax.ie.2: Consider PLC options outside the CAOFebruaryMarch – The further education (FE) sector has thousands of opportunities for students who may consider that a year consolidating their learning in a specific area of knowledge while developing their academic self-management skills, would better prepare them for successful engagement with a third-level programme.Further education (FE) is also extremely useful for those who may not secure the CAO points for their preferred course choice. Many third-level colleges reserve up to 10 per cent of the overall places for applicants who have successfully completed a level-five FE award in that specific discipline.Colleges of further education, which provide these programmes throughout the country, report that many students who defer entering third level directly from school and instead spend a year securing a PLC award often perform far better than their school peers when they progress to universities and ITs a year later.If you have a strength in one subject area in school but may not be academically strong across the full range of Leaving Certificate subjects, deciding to spend a year at PLC level in that subject could be a very wise decision. If students get distinctions in all eight PLC modules, they have a good chance of a reserved place in their preferred CAO course next year. See careersportal.ie for a database of such linked programmes.PLC programmes also offer training in practical skills for employment in a trade or craft such as business, hairdressing, beauty and the fire and ambulance services.Students interested in local PLC courses need to fill out application forms, usually online, from inidual colleges in the next few months further education courses and PLCs are not in the centralised CAO system. Places are offered mostly on a first-come, first-served basis and may be impossible to secure later in the year.In the 2020 CAO application season, 12,556 people presented a QQI (Quality and Qualifications Ireland) FETFetac further education award (formerly NCVA). A total of 3,941 others presented further education awards received from other regulatory bodies. At the beginning of August 2020 the CAO made 4,155 offers in round zero, the majority of which were to applicants presenting further-education awards. Many of these college place offers were in courses which require more than 500 CAO points from those competing on the basis of the Leaving Cert alone. 3: End of the road for Irish PLC nursing studies in the UK?Since the Health Service Executive cut the number of approved nursing places by 310 to 1,570 in 2010 to cut costs associated with paying student nursing during their fourth-year placements, the CAO points required to secure a place have been beyond the reach of many school-leavers.Many who do not make the cut apply to FE pre-nursing courses, in the hope of securing a CAO place the following year. Sadly, only a handful of places are made available by colleges through this route. Until 2016, given the tiny numbers of CAO places on offer to FE graduates, most successful PLC nursing students applied for UK programmes which were funded by the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) – up to 500 Irish students went annually. However, over the past four academic years, new students on nursing, midwifery and AHP (allied health professional) pre-registration courses in England – which lead to a qualification with one of the health professional regulators – must take out maintenance and tuition loans rather than getting a NHS grant.This affects courses leading to professional registration in nursing (all four fields), midwifery, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, podiatry, radiography, dietetics, orthoptics, operating department practice as well as prosthetics and orthotics.This change has impacted hugely on the numbers of students from the Republic seeking nursing or paramedical courses in the UK through Ucas (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) as they will now have to pay the full annual tuition fee of at least £9,250 (€10,837).Although Britain has now left the European Union, the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland means that Irish students will not be treated as international students in the UK in the coming academic year and will, therefore, still be levied fees of €9,250. January and MayJune – You need to apply for any course listed as restricted in the CAO handbook by February 1st. All other courses can be added or removed from your application list up to the final change-of-mind deadline on July 1st. If you want to apply for university in the UK, you must finalise your course list with Ucas by January 15th. You must also indicate which PLC courses you are applying for on your initial application to each college. For courses in other EU countries offered through English, closing dates are on the course profile pages on eunicas.ie.Between February 5th and March 1st, any CAO applicant may change a course choice for a fee of €10. If you are a mature student or have applied for a restricted application course, or if you want to apply for a course you have not yet listed and wish to correct or amend your application record, you must report any errors or changes to the CAO by March 1st (fee €10).Otherwise, you don’t need to make course changes at this stage but if you have to, you can use the change-of-mind facility (May 5th-July 1st) with no charge.Before the end of May, all applicants receive a statement of application record as a final acknowledgment and to verify that all information is accurate. If this does not arrive by June 1st, contact the CAO immediately.Accompanying this statement will be a change-of-mind form, which you can use up to the closing date at 5.15pm on July 1st. You may make as many changes as you wish online.JulyAugust – In the first week of July 2020, the CAO made offers to 5,800 iniduals who were almost exclusively mature applicants (aged over 23) and applicants who accepted and deferred a place last year. A further 4,155-plus iniduals received offers in round zero at the beginning of August. Most of these offers were to FE graduates who had a PLC award. Several hundred places in graduate medicine are offered at this stage also. These offers arrive at the applicant’s home address in the middle of summer so be sure to decide how to deal with any offers sent to you. Offers are also available online but you need to log on to get them and there is no email or text alert.When the change-of-mind period closes on July 1st, sixth-year students wait for the results of their Leaving Cert in mid-August. When the results are out, admissions officers in the third-level institutions inform the CAO of the number of places available on each course.The CAO then allocates places via computer, based on the results of each qualifying student and the instructions of the admissions officers.Colleges offer a specific number of places on each course listed with the CAO. Students are offered their highest choice on each list that their points give them access to. If there are 100 places on offer, the 100 students with the correct entry requirements, who have the highest points, will be offered these places in round one.When the CAO receives the Leaving Cert results, each candidate’s choices are examined by the computer, starting with their first choice on each list and working downwards. When their points fall within the number of places offered on a course, the computer offers that place and removes all lower-preference courses.The CAO may later offer a place on a course listed higher on your list if it becomes available.It is imperative that candidates list their choices in the order that they desire them, from one to 10, with one being their most desired course and 10 being the least desired.As the UK loses much of its attraction to Irish students due to Brexit and higher costs associated with the withdrawal of NHS funding to nursing and paramedical programmes, European universities, which offer more than 1,100 undergraduate degrees across all disciplines through English, are attracting growing numbers of Irish applicants. There are now more than 1,000 Irish undergraduate students in Dutch universities.Some of these European universities, which rank in the top 100 worldwide in international ranking, who registered four or five Irish students five years ago, are now admitting more than 100 students per year (eunicas.ie).As is the norm in continental Europe, fees range from just over €2,000 in the Netherlands to no fees in Germany and Scandinavian countries. Medical and veterinary programmes in eastern European countries charge fees of €10,000 upwards.Many of these countries have invested in their third-level infrastructure for centuries and have sufficient places to accommodate most aspiring applicants. In recent decades, due to lower birth rates, fewer young people are seeking third-level places so places are more easily available. Matriculation entry requirements are similar to Irish universities, two H5s and four O6s in the Leaving Cert in most cases but, unlike in Ireland, there are no CAO points requirements.A student on 300 CAO points could well secure entry to a European university programme to study, for example, physiotherapy or psychology – courses which would require at least 500 points in Ireland.But given that securing a place in a European university for domestic as well as external applicants is relatively easy compared to an Irish one, failure or drop-out rates after first year are high at up to 40 per cent for domestic students. Irish students’ attrition rates on these courses tend to be much lower, probably reflecting a higher level of commitment required to secure the offer of a place.So be warned: after securing your first-year place, passing your exams and completing the course over three to four years is a big challenge and repeating first year is often not allowed, unless you have secured the majority of required credits in your examinations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4436575.1608030884!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what to consider when selecting your next move after leaving cert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCareer choices will recur many times over your lifetime. Photograph: Getty Images What will you do after you complete the Leaving Cert? It might seem a simple question but if you think about it, you might find that the answer is not quite as straightforward as you first thought.Are you interested in a career in medicine, business, social studies, the creative arts or design? Or like so many others at this stage in the Leaving Cert cycle, you may not have made your mind up yet.Life is a journey of exploration and discovery. Any adult reflecting on their career since leaving school realises that expecting a young person at the age of 18 or 19 to decide their occupation for life in sixth year is completely unrealistic.Nobody knows what the next three to five years will bring. Both you as an 18 year old and I at 66 go through the same process to determine what happens next on our career path. We look at our life experiences, our interests and aptitudes, likes and dislikes, opportunities and what our financial and personal circumstances offer us.The only difference between us is that I have more clues buried in my life journey than you have. You will probably engage in this reflection and decision-making process at least 15 to 20 times between now and when you are physically incapable of meaningful career activity – which may be more than 50 years away in your case.ChoicesCareer choices will recur many times over your lifetime. The options at the end of second-level education are the first significant career choices you will make, but they are not life-determining.Therefore, don’t get anxious or distressed by this decision-making process now, as you’ll face it again throughout your life. The decision about next September will simply determine what you will commit to for next year, or, with college choices, three to four years. It is perfectly normal to tell your guidance counsellor at this stage that you have no idea now about what you want to do after the Leaving Cert.Clues embedded in your life story to date can help determine your next step. Your unique life experience advances daily as you express yourself in your personal, educational, sporting, musical, social and vocational life.To make sense of it, sit down and look at the jigsaw pieces of your life. The trick is to see if there is a pattern or linking theme within them.QuestionsGo through the following questions and jot down any relevant answers or information that arises. When you have finished your list of facts about yourself, look to see if there is a pattern to it. You may see a theme or possible area of interest emerge, which will inform your research in the months ahead.We all have a wide range of interests, hobbies, skills, aptitudes and achievements, both academic and personal. Can you put the facts about yourself together to see what picture may emerge?1: What do you enjoy doing in your personal life? Are you an outdoors type who loves the freedom of being in the open air? Are you good with people and do you enjoy helping or caring for them?2: Alternatively, you may enjoy making things or taking them apart to see how they work. Are you entrepreneurial, having bought and sold things among your friends and made a profit? Do you like routine and organising your room so it is neat and tidy, where you can find anything you want at a moment’s notice? The answers will give you clues to your future career journey.3: What are your favourite subjects – which ones have you done well in, in school exams or the Junior Certificate? Do they include languages, the sciences, business, technological subjects or perhaps the creative arts? If you took any interest inventories to help choose Leaving Cert subjects, they may indicate career or course areas of interest.4: You probably took aptitude tests either at the end of your Junior Cert year or in transition year. Did they indicate you were strong in numerical, linguistic, abstract, mechanical or organisational reasoning? This is an important clue.5: Family interests may also come into play. Is there a pattern in your family, on either side, which might point you in a direction?6: Have you helped at home or in a family business or profession? Many people follow a family direction, such as politics, farming or business.Remember, you are not looking for any blinding flash of inspiration that will determine your entire working life, but a strong indication of what might be the best next step in your life. If you get that right, it will consolidate the pattern and help you to take the next step in a few years, after completing your initial choice. Just one step at a time constitutes perfect career planning.Your decision may be to apply to college for this September or to volunteer abroad for a year or to do something completely different.

It adds to the challenge you face because the opposition is bringing some new players to the field,” he said.“It doesn’t change what we need to do to win. It just changes the strength of the opponent and in that sense we have to take from that that we have to redouble our efforts.”‘Near vertical’ growthWHO infectious disease epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said countries such as Ireland had seen “near vertical” exponential growth in cases due to mixing over Christmas and New Year.“Transmission was down to single digits in most countries in Europe over the summer. And we lost the battle because changed our mixing patterns over the summer, into the fall, and especially Christmas and New Year holidays. The number of contacts that iniduals had and their families had increased significantly,” Dr Van Kerkhove said.“Those countries that have managed to bring transmission down: keep it down. Do everything you can to keep it down . . . If any cases are identified any clusters are identified, really quick, rapid, aggressive investigation of those cases, so that those small numbers of cases do not become community transmission. We have been shown over and over again that countries can do this.”The Geneva-based health experts urged inidual citizens to keep their distance, reduce their contacts, wear masks, ventilate rooms, keep their hands clean and cough into their elbow to combat the spread of the virus. Countries must also support their citizens in observing quarantine, they added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4455826.1610402715!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 up to 700 000 to be vaccinated by end of march donnelly","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Donnelly. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsUp to 700,000 people in the State should be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of March if, as expected, the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is approved by the European medicines regulator, the Minister for Health has said.Stephen Donnelly said that if the approval and delivery schedules for the vaccine proceeded as planned, and supplies of two others continued to arrive, the first three cohorts in the State’s vaccination plan should be immunised by the end of the first quarter of the year.“We are planning on 1.4 million doses in total” by the end of the quarter, he said, 600,000 of which would be the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. This would enable front-line healthcare workers, residents and staff in long-term residential facilities, and half a million older people to be immunised. “We are also putting in place plans such that if any of those volumes increase, we can scale accordingly.”Quarterly estimates produced by the vaccine task force and distributed to party leaders last week in fact show higher volumes, but these are broad estimates based on advance purchase agreements struck with the companies, rather than any specific delivery timetable. According to the document, some 1.7 million doses may be available in the first quarter, building to 3.9 million in the second quarter, and 4.4 million in the third. Vaccination staffRóisín Shortall, joint leader of the Social Democrats, called for clarity about there being enough vaccinators to administer the programme. “It’s not a problem at the moment, but when we get to the point where there are significant quantities, I can’t see where the big numbers of staff will come from to do that,” she said. Her call came as the HSE and Department of Health continued negotiations with groups representing family doctors and pharmacists over their role in the vaccination programme. If Oxford-AstraZeneca’s jab is approved, it broadens the possibility for these groups to become involved, as it does not require ultra-cold storage, as the Pfizer-BionNtech and Moderna shots do. The Irish Pharmacy Union told its members on Monday that they are “likely” to be involved in the rollout of the programme once the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is approved. In an update to members, the union also said it was insisting that pharmacists “be prioritised for early vaccination” and suggested that they could be vaccinated by the end of next month.

Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinThousands of health service staff are set to be redeployed and a deal allowing the use of private hospital capacity is to be triggered this week in order to cope with the unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases.With officials warning that up to 2,500 virus patients could potentially need a hospital bed within the next two weeks, and 400 may require intensive care (ICU) treatment, surge plans are expected to be activated in the coming days.Despite signs that case numbers have stabilised, the health service is expected to come under intense pressure for the next week or two as hospitalisations and ICU admissions rise further before the situation starts to improve. The number of Covid-19 patients in ICU, currently at 146, is expected to surpass last spring’s peak as soon as today. Half of these patients are on ventilators.Officials said on Monday night that with case numbers stabilising at about 6,000 a day, hospitalisations will peak at 2,200-2,500 people in 10-14 days’ time, with 200-400 people in ICU.Figures will be at the worse end of the spectrum if people do not stick to the lockdown measures, Prof Philip Nolan of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) warned.ICU capacity is about 300 but this can be stretched through surge measures while some patients can be given high-flow oxygen on ordinary wards. There was better news on Monday about vaccines. Supplies of the Moderna jab, which was authorised last week, will arrive in Ireland at the end of the week. Separately, large quantities of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine should be available here immediately after authorisation if, as expected, is given by the European Medicines Agency at the end of the month, officials said.Highest ratesAnother eight deaths and 4,929 Covid-19 cases were reported on Monday, pushing the total number of cases over the 150,000 mark just eight days after the 100,000 case mark was exceeded. Ireland has the highest rate of Covid-19 in the world, according to figures published on Monday. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said surge plans were in place which would be needed in the upcoming period. He said hospitalisations would “continue to increase” and this would happen relatively quickly.Nphet officials declined to project how many deaths might occur, saying they wanted to support the HSE and focus on what was “avoidable”. The highly transmissible variant first identified in the UK now accounts for almost half of all samples tested in the State, a Nphet briefing was told, and is expected to quickly become the dominant strain here.Asked whether restrictions might have to remain in force for the entire year as a result, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said this was “an unknown thing” for now.The HSE has identified 1,300 nurses across the system who have ICU experience and could be deployed to the treatment of the sickest patients.Mr Donnelly said the State was planning to have vaccinated 700,000 by the end of the first quarter of the year, which would cover almost all over-70s, frontline healthcare workers, and nursing home residents and staff. But this target relies on the delivery of 600,000 doses of the as-yet-unapproved Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. The Cabinet is set to be updated on these figures on Tuesday.

Since then, more information has come available so we have a better idea of when people might be immunised.So what do we know now?About 15 million doses of vaccines are on order for Ireland in 2021 and 2022, more than enough to vaccinate the entire population. On the supply side, the PfizerBioNTech Covid-19 vaccine was authorised last month and\u0026nbspadministration to healthcare workers started last December 29th. In January and February, a weekly supply of 40,000 doses will be used to vaccinate health staff and residents and staff in care facilities. Both these groups, which are either vulnerable or highly exposed to virus, should be vaccinated before the end of February.And what then?This is where things become less clear, with uncertainties surrounding both the supply and authorisation of vaccines. Officials want to start ramping up the programme at this point, but this can only be done if sufficient supplies of authorised vaccines are available to Ireland. They believe millions of doses of vaccine will be available monthly, but only in the second half of the year.Pfizer is scaling up manufacturing of its vaccine but for now the company is unable to quantify its supplies to Ireland from March on.EU regulators have approved a second vaccine, by Moderna, and its US manufacturers have just begun shipping it to EU member states this week. We haven’t yet heard from Irish officials when it will come into play in our vaccination strategy.The overall speed of the Irish vaccination rollout may ultimately be determined by the fate of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine. This doesn’t have the special handling and transportation requirements of the other two vaccines, which require cold storage, and so would be best suited for delivery in the community, for example in GP surgeries, pharmacies or mass vaccinations sites.Though approved for use in the UK, this vaccine has had a bumpy ride elsewhere, and EU and US regulators have sought more information. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is due to decide on OxfordAstraZeneca at the end of this month before then, it is impossible to say when the broad mass of the population will be vaccinated.The EMA will also decide on other vaccines, for example from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and CureVac, soon but this is not going to impact on supply in the short term.So when will I be vaccinated?Your place in the queue is determined by an allocation schedule published in December. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.Vaccination of these groups will likely started towards the end of February, though where and at what pace is still not clear.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.Can we go any faster?Given the current limits on supply, there is little point in accelerating rollout right now. Administering the vaccine is relatively straightforward, though it has to be done by a healthcare professional. Well over 1 million adults and children received the flu vaccine last autumn, by way of comparison.Can anything else be done to improve supply?Health staff are now getting six doses from a vial of PfizerBioNTech vaccine instead of the five originally envisaged, though this is not being factored into official calculations. This means up to 20 per cent more people could be immunised from the same supply of doses.With Covid-19 rates surging this winter, many countries have looked at delaying the administration of the second dose so that more people can receive an initial dose and thereby be at least partially protected against the virus.Irish officials have decided not to follow the UK’s lead on this but are keeping the option under review.Have there been any side effects so far?Expected common side effects may include muscle pains, headaches, tiredness or swelling in the upper arm. Often people can develop a short-lived fever after a vaccination, particularly after the second dose. So far, only a tiny number of short-term side-effects have been observed in Ireland.Will everyone get the vaccine in the end?At least 70 per cent the population will have to be immunised in order to provide the kind of immunity needed to protect against the virus. But only 45 per cent have said they will definitely get it, so some are hesitant. This problem could get worse after the current surge ebbs away and cases dwindle - ironically thanks in part to people being vaccinated - leading people to lower their perception of threat.So when will I find out when I can get the vaccine?If the EMA authorises the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine at the end of this month, you can expect to see dates being firmed up quickly for the mass vaccination of the population. If this does not happen, it seems unlikely the average healthy adult will be vaccinated until the autumn.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4455786.1610398444!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"seven in 10 irish people live in homes too large for their needs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOfficial statistics revealed that 69.6 per cent of Irish people were living in dwellings deemed too large for their needs in 2019 in terms of excess rooms. File photograph: iStockAlmost seven in 10 people in Ireland are living in homes that are too large for their household needs.New figures published by the European Commission show that Ireland has one of the highest rates of people living in under-occupied dwellings in the EU.The official statistics, released by Eurostat, revealed that 69.6 per cent of Irish people were living in dwellings deemed too large for their needs in 2019 in terms of excess rooms and more specifically bedrooms. This was more than twice the EU average of 32.7 per cent.Only Malta and Cyprus had higher rates of under-occupied homes than Ireland.“The classic cause of under-occupation is older iniduals or couples remaining in their home after their children have grown up and left, while family breakdown can also result in under-occupation,” a Eurostat spokesperson said.On average there are 2.1 rooms per person in Irish households compared with the EU average of 1.6 rooms.The Republic’s high rate is believed to be linked to the large number of adults living in “empty nest” households, as well as the relatively larger size of traditional Irish families and associated need for more bedrooms compared with most other European countries.The figures show that more than 92 per cent of older people in Ireland are living in homes considered too big for their needs.Overcrowded dwellingsMeanwhile, 3.2 per cent of the Irish population were classified as living in overcrowded households in 2019, which increased from 2.7 per cent the previous year.It is still the second-lowest rate among the EU’s 27 member states, where 17.2 per cent of people on average live in households without enough rooms for their needs.Irish men (3.5 per cent) are also more likely than Irish women (3.0 per cent) to live in overcrowded households.Based on age, 20-25-year-olds are most likely to be living in an overcrowded dwelling with the problem affecting 5.8 per cent of that age group compared with just 0.3 per cent of those aged over 65.Overcrowded accommodation is considered to be any dwelling that does not have the number of rooms appropriate to the size of the household, the family situation and the ages of its members.It is calculated on the basis of their being one living room, one room per couple, one room for each single adult, one room per pair of single people of the same gender aged 12-17 and one room per pair of children under 12.On measures of housing quality, Irish homes were slightly better than the EU average, with 12.5 per cent of Irish people living in a house with a leaking roof and 4.9 per cent unable to keep their home adequately warm.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4455792.1610399149!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and beef farmers plans for exceptional aid discussed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBeef prices have held up relatively well in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but Ministers have been warned of potential disruption to come. Photograph:  Todd KorolReutersThe Government is discussing plans for exceptional aid to beef farmers despite the presence of a Brexit trade deal, The  has learned.While beef prices have held up relatively well in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, Ministers have been told of the potential for significant impact at farm level, and for beef farmers in particular, down to market disruption arising from non-tariff barriers.The stronger beef price means interventions are unlikely to be needed imminently, but Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue said while it was “heartening” to see the price hold up, the situation will be closely monitored.Work being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine suggests that the non-tariff barriers may translate directly into lower prices at the farm gate for beef, and lower farm incomes, leading to the need for significant aid to the sector.The department believes farm incomes could be hit by up to 13 per cent due to non-tariff barriers, even though a deal has been struck.“The Government has been very clear from the outset that agri-food and fisheries will be the most impacted sectors, including in a deal scenario. We are committed to working with the agri-food sector to support it to meet the challenge of Brexit,” Mr McConalogue said.DemandsSupports being discussed include additional funding for rural development initiatives and local food supply chains, it is understood, as well as support for the tillage and horticulture sectors.However, demands from the food processing industry for an export credit insurance scheme are unlikely to be acceded to.It is understood that there would be significant complications in putting such a support scheme in place. Unlike many EU countries, Ireland does not have such a scheme in existence.A capital investment scheme for the agri-food sector has already been agreed worth €100 million in additional exchequer funding. The scheme is aimed at helping food processors modernise and ersify after Brexit.The fisheries sector, which is expected to be hit harder than farmers in post-Brexit redrawing of fisheries rules, may also see the introduction of a permanent fleet decommissioning scheme this year to compensate trawler owners whose livelihoods are threatened.With Ireland’s fleet of trawlers likely to be permanently smaller after Brexit, supports for coastal communities have been identified as a key policy by industry groups.Mr McConalogue said that the outcome of the Brexit negotiations “does involve the loss of quota and between now and 2026 and we’re very much aware that is something that will have a real impact on the fisheries sector”. About 15 per cent of the Irish fisheries quota will be impacted over the next four years.As well as the permanent mothballing of parts of the fleet, a temporary fleet tie-up scheme may be put in place from the second quarter of the year in order to alleviate initial impacts.DeprivedIn addition to this, the Government is examining investment support schemes for seafood processors and other aquaculture businesses, designed to be spread over the coming years.There are also plans to encourage coastal communities deprived of income to economically ersify, into marine tourism or marine infrastructural development – the redevelopment of small harbours and piers, for example.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The Capitol building in Washington DC, the great cathedral of “government of the people, by the people, for the people” was invaded and desecrated. Worse still, this happened at the hands of a mob incited and motivated by the president of the United States himself. On the same day, in Hong Kong, 53 pro-democracy legislators and campaigners were arrested for “subverting state power”. Their offence was to have organised or taken part in primary voting to choose candidates for an entirely legal election. Such activity now amounts to “disrupting and undermining the Hong Kong government”. These arrests took place conveniently just after the EU had signed a new investment agreement with China, with European leaders played for fools. Meanwhile, voters anywhere trying to make sense of events are battered by categoric assertions that have no basis in fact. Trump has continued to maintain that he won by a landslide an election that he lost by seven million votes, even though there isn’t a single scrap of evidence to support him. Allegations about the dangers of vaccinations have led many millions of people in France to be unwilling to be vaccinated at all. In China, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, spoke last week of his country having “raced to report the epidemic first” and that “the pandemic is likely to have emerged in many places around the world”, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. The combination of a loss of trust in elections in the world’s most powerful home of freedom, the cost-free snuffing out of democratic ideas by totalitarians and the steady erosion of the public’s grip on what is true or false add up to a gathering crisis for the future of free and open societies. In Moscow, Tehran and Beijing, there is much satisfaction at the chaos in Washington and at the state of the West: increasingly unsure of its own institutions, polarised within nations and suffering severely in a pandemic that hits free people particularly hard. Global surveys have demonstrated a growing loss of faith in democracy among young people. Even in countries with democratic traditions going back decades, the space for effective opposition to incumbent governments is being constrained. In Hungary, the media and judiciary have fallen under the control of ministers in India, the Modi government is showing autocratic tendencies in Erdogan’s Turkey, some opposition politicians are in prison in Sri Lanka the government is empowering the military and abandoning commitments to justice and human rights. Complacency about democracy is too easy. We all believe the 20th century made the world safe for it and the Cold War proved its timeless superiority. And in the decades since, we have felt able to get on with our inward-looking disagreements without worrying about its future. We reassure ourselves that democracy has proved its resilience time and again. Isn’t it great that the courts in the US refused to entertain the baseless arguments of Trump’s legal team? Didn’t the Republicans do well to finally turn against him, rather than set aside the outcome of a presidential election? The system did indeed hold up. But we cannot be sure that it could withstand another president trying to stay in office whatever the cost, or another time that vast numbers of people believed an election was stolen. We can no longer be sure that the faltering performance of many Western nations in the face of a pandemic, the growing gulf between populations and elites, the discontent over inequality, the loss of trust in public institutions and the disaffection among young people are just problems we can overcome eventually, with the system still intact at the end. Attention needs to be given to repairing, sustaining, justifying, strengthening and defending democratic values. The virtues of freedom, and the human dignity and fulfilment that come from allowing competing ideas in a tolerant framework within the rule of law need to be advocated and championed again. Of course, this is a vast and complex task. Democracies like ours will have to forge a stronger common national purpose so that conflicting cultural identities don’t pull us apart. We will have to allow more decentralised decision-making. It will be vital to regulate social media so that varied views are heard instead of a stream of assertions that reinforce our prejudices. We will have to be better prepared for an unexpected crisis such as the pandemic. Such challenges will be the work of decades. But we can at least begin, with a robust defence against external interference, a clear-eyed understanding of what is going on under authoritarian regimes, and a reinvigoration of the Western alliance with intensified cooperation on trade, technology and security. Joe Biden’s election is a rare opportunity to do so, since he is committed to at least trying to bring the world’s democracies together. Given that Twitter last year alone deleted more than 1,000 accounts promoting state-backed Russian propaganda and thousands spreading Chinese official opinion, it is fair to assume that a massive effort is still going on to ensure voters are misinformed and misled. The world’s democratic leaders should agree to pool their efforts to disarm such attacks. They should speak frankly about the conditions in countries without the freedoms we take for granted. Tomorrow, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission will publish a new report on China, detailing a wide range of abuses including torture, arbitrary arrest, forced confessions and the incarceration of huge numbers of people in Xinjiang. Such findings should be taken seriously by leaders who still prefer to turn a blind eye to the nature of a ruthless one-party system. And with Trump’s go-it-alone attitude on the way out, Western nations should work towards finding solidarity on trade, so that Australia isn’t being penalised by the Chinese at the same time as Brussels pushes for a trade agreement with Beijing. If Joe Biden can muster the clarity and create the unity that is needed, democracy could be in better shape by the end of this year. He needs support from those who love freedom, anywhere in the world. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"muslim schoolgirl feels bullied school sent home wearing skirt","story":"A Muslim schoolgirl says she is being “bullied” for her religious beliefs after she was sent home from school for wearing a skirt that was “too long” and her parents were threatened with legal action.Siham Hamud, 12, says she was sent home from Uxbridge High School every single day during term time in December and told to come back with a shorter, school-issue skirt.The young girl’s father, Idris, said that his family follow a traditional branch of Islam, which means they want to believe in their religion in a pure way, which means women should only wear long skirts.Because of these beliefs, Siham refused to return to class in a shorter skirt, and now the school has threatened the family with legal action for her unauthorised absences.Siham, who is currently studying from home due to Covid lockdown restrictions, said: It feels like bullying because of what I believe.I think they should just let me wear my school uniform to school.I like school normally, and English, drama and RE are my favourite lessons but I couldn\u0027t attend.I find it annoying because I\u0027ve missed a month of school, so I have to catch up a lot. I wish I could just have gone to school as normal.It makes me feel left out, because I can\u0027t see my friends either. They aren\u0027t accepting me for my religion and that\u0027s wrong.I feel confused and annoyed that I can\u0027t wear what I want for my religion. I hope they\u0027ll change their rules so that girls like me wear skirts to school.Idris, an athletics coach, added: My daughter is being denied an education because of her religious beliefs.All Siham wants to do is to wear a skirt which is a few centimetres longer than her classmates - and I don\u0027t know why the school has such a problem with this.She is sent home to change into a shorter skirt then return to school later that day - but she isn\u0027t going to change her beliefs in an hour.The school is threatening to take legal action against me, but I\u0027m not forcing her to wear a longer skirt - it\u0027s her faith and her decision to make.She used to love school, but now she goes to school crying because of this - it\u0027s heartbreaking.Siham’s older sisters Sumayyah, 19, and Ilham, 17, both wore longer skirts to school without issue, but new rules brought in two years ago state that school-branded skirts or trousers must be worn.The school sent her parents a letter threatening legal action against them for their daughter\u0027s alleged unauthorised absences on December 9.It said: Siham\u0027s absence is being recorded as unauthorised. Unauthorised absence may result in a fine being issued, or legal action being taken against the adults who have parental responsibility or day-to-day care of your child.Legal action can be in the form of a penalty notice or a summons to the magistrates\u0027 court.I must ask that you support the school and your daughter by ensuring that she attends school in full school uniform with immediate effect.But Mr Hamud says he will fight any action taken.Siham makes her own decisions about her religion, and I can\u0027t make her wear clothes she doesn\u0027t want to wear, so neither should the school,” he said.She is being denied an education because of her religious beliefs, and I don\u0027t know how anyone can get away with that.While Siham has been learning from home since the new term began, Mr Hamud expects the issue to return once face-to-face teaching resumes.He said the issue is due to be discussed on a complaints panel with the school governors later this month.The school\u0027s principal, Nigel Clemens, said: This matter is currently subject to examination through the formal school complaints policy.

We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required.If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.The DfE also said that schools were expected to strongly encourage vulnerable children to attend class.Vulnerable children could include pupils who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home due to a lack of devices or a quiet space to study, according to the advice.But Government guidance says parents who choose to keep children out of class will not be penalised.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools. This means the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children.The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least the February half-term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being finetuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and (very rarely) the entire school could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tim davie urges bbc reporters avoid sizzle partiality","story":"The BBC must avoid the sizzle of partiality and stick to honestly reporting the facts, its director-general has said.Tim Davie said BBC reporters must be activists for impartiality but stressed that they should not take that to mean they should give up on compelling storytelling and produce dull reports.In polarised times, and with a proliferation of alternative news sources springing up online, the BBC can no longer take for granted that people still understand our intent, he said.Speaking to the Reuters Next summit, Mr Davie said: Do you need the sizzle of partiality to cut through in this space?

I like them to be out there on social media.The issue was to reaffirm our vows around social media being just one outlet for our impartial journalism.Mr Davie also said social media can be a toxic place for BBC journalists, particularly women, adding: In social media we\u0027re seeing significant abuse, unacceptable abuse, of journalists. I have to say that this is particularly prevalent among women reporters – over 50 per cent in a recent survey said they were facing abuse online – so I think we\u0027ve got to be active in this and forthright and also supportive of journalists wherever they are around the world.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"twitter proves dont actually like encountering people different","story":"There was a time when we thought if we could just all communicate with one another, across the world, person-to-person that the world would be immeasurably better – we’d lose our doubt and suspicion and gain a real understanding of our shared humanity and our shared value. Such was the idealism when communications technologies started to make this vision sound possible that it was enshrined in the mottos of the institutions of the new radio era: “Nation shall speak peace unto nation” remains the motto of the BBC to this day.Technology in the 21st century has delivered on the vision of a global conversation in a way that radio waves never could. We now have a platform that creates a common ground where everyone from world leaders, to the pope, to ambassadors, journalists and the man or woman in the street can share their ideas on virtually any topic.The problem is that platform is called Twitter – and few if any of us feel as if that particular social network is about to foster a new era of world peace.The reflexive reaction is to blame the technology companies themselves. There’s certainly a good case to make against them – they often seem almost painfully out of touch to the problems their networks cause, they moderate content too little and too late, and for years they provided a platform to Donald Trump to incite all sorts of actions against his political enemies saying they could take no action against a sitting President – until they could.On top of the many legitimate criticisms to be levelled against Twitter and other tech giants comes an idea that it is their algorithms and the way they display their posts that are polarising us: they are creating so-called “filter bubbles”, exposing us only to views that we agree with until our endless scrolling radicalises us into an extreme version of our offline selves.This is possible, though the theory is not backed up by any kind of strong evidence. But there’s a simpler alternative explanation which seems to better fit reality: Twitter and social media isn’t iding us because it pushes us further apart. It’s iding us because it brings us closer together.Before the internet, it was easy to imagine that whatever opinions we held were probably shared by most people – or at least would be if we could only have chance to persuade people of them. We rarely knew what our neighbours thought of the political issues of the day – we often wouldn’t know what our extended family actually thought about immigration, gay rights, abortion, or numerous other issues. On top of this, many of our usual rules of social etiquette meant we would rarely discuss those topics.Now, we can debate and share any issue with anyone in real time – and we’ve discovered lots of people disagree wildly with us and will not be persuaded by our most reasonable arguments. The result is we quickly get frustrated, then angry, then find we’ve lost 12 hours shouting at a stranger – or our problematic uncle – on the internet.We like to say that the internet is pushing us apart. Instead, it’s pulling us together – and that, in itself, might just be the problem. The internet has delivered on the dream it promised us: man can speak unto man. It’s out fault, not the technology’s, that this has turned out to be something of a nightmare.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"welcome brexit dutch officials confiscate british truckers sandwiches","story":"British hauliers have had ham sandwiches confiscated at the Dutch border after customs officers told truckers “welcome to Brexit”. In video footage aired by Dutch TV it shows British drivers having their packed lunches confiscated under new Brexit rules which ban the personal importation of any meat and dairy items. In the recording the officer tells the lorry driver, who is outside his vehicle at the Hook of Holland ferry terminal, that as a result of Brexit, “you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff.”The new laws came into effect on New Year’s Day, after the transition period was completed. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states commercial drivers will “not be able to bring POAO (products of an animal origin) such as those containing meat or dairy (for example, a ham and cheese sandwich) into the EU”. It comes as hauliers have warned that freight delays will escalate this week as more firms attempt to send lorries abroad.Rod McKenzie, director of policy and public affairs at the Road Haulage Association (RHA), said he was very worried about the impact of post-Brexit customs checks.He said: Traders have been holding off sending lorries into harm\u0027s way, because they wanted to see what other people\u0027s problems were so they could learn from them.But you can\u0027t keep doing that forever, you\u0027ve got to trade. There will come a moment when people bite the bullet and send the truck.Pete White, transport manager at Berkshire-based haulage firm Whites Transport Services, said his lorries are suffering major disruption, with journeys that previously took two days now taking up to five.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has been urged to intervene after Kirkella, the trawler which normally catches up to 10 per cent of all the fish sold in the UK\u0027s fish and chip shops, continues to be tied up in port waiting for new distant-waters fishing deals.The 100-strong crew of Kirkella are still waiting for negotiations to be completed with Norway and other countries. Kirkella, which can freeze up to 780 tonnes of cod and haddock on its trips, has been tied up in St George\u0027s Dock, Hull, since returning from its last trip at the beginning of December.In a letter to the Prime Minister, Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull East, said he wanted to know the Government\u0027s plan to secure continued access to the quotas the UK has caught historically in the Norwegian Economic Zone (NEZ) in and around the Barents Sea.The MP said he also wanted to know about plans to secure access to the waters around Svalbard, Greenland and Iceland.Chief executive of UK Fisheries, Jane Sandell, said: Talks between the UK, the EU and Norway are only beginning now, and there is no certainty unless the Government seriously raises its game that we will get anything like the quota we need in distant waters that will make fishing economically viable for us.”A UK Government spokesman said: The UK has secured a Fisheries Framework Agreement with Norway and the Faroe Islands, which provides the legal basis for annual negotiations on fishing opportunities and potential access to each other\u0027s waters.Negotiations for fishing opportunities in 2021 will be concluded as soon as possible.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits baffled dutch customs officers","story":"NewsBrits have ham sandwiches seized by Dutch officials saying Welcome to Brexit\"Welcome to Brexit, sir\" - Dutch TV has broadcast footage of customs officers confiscating ham and cheese sandwiches from British drivers trying to cross the bordermirrorShareByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsWelcome to Brexit, sir, customs officials told British travellers \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Post-Brexit rules ban the import of meat and dairy products into the EU - with the UK government warning travellers to use, consume, or dispose of any items before crossing the border. But footage broadcast on Dutch TV shows customs officers informing baffled drivers of the new rules - and taking their sandwiches away. Officials at the ferry terminal at the Hook of Holland were shown explaining to drivers that you are no longer allowed to bring certain foods to Europe, like meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, that kind of stuff.”Askedthey could just seize the ham and leave the bread, one official said: No, everything will be confiscated.

His clarication came after a day of confusion onthe simple act fell within the rules. Asked directly at this eveningaposs Downing Street press conference aboutit does fall within the rules, Mr Hancock still didnapost clearly answer yes - but he was much clearer than anyone  has managed. Mr Hancock said you can go to a park and exercise with one other person, and you should remain two metres apart. The government has stressed that coffee shops remain open for takeway. So it looks like it means you can go with a friend to park to walk - so long as your purpose is to take exercise - and pick up a coffee. But - they key point according to the Health Secretary is that you should be exercising, not socialising. Mr Hancock warned that a crackdown could followpeople kept flexing the rules. He says people keep meeting in larger groups, and:  too many people keep breaking this rule, then we are going to have to look at it. Earlier, Mr Johnson called for people to be aware of their surroundings when outside the home and hinted that rules could be tightenedpeople didnapost follow them.Mr Hancock did warn though that stronger enforcement of coronavirus rules is “necessary”, Matt Hancock said, as he praised police for stepping up their efforts.The Health Secretary added: “It isn’t just about the Government and the rules we set, or the police and the work that they do – it’s about how everybody behaves. “I applaud the action Morrisons has taken today, the supermarket, they have said that they will not let people in without a mask unless they clearly have a medical reason. “That’s the right approach and I want to see all parts of society playing their part in this.” Mr Johnson said: “In supermarkets people need to be keeping their distance, making sure that they’re wearing masks, doing the right thing. “We need to enforce the rules in supermarkets. “When people are getting takeaway drinks, in cafes, then they need to avoid spreading the disease there, avoid mingling too much.” Mr Johnson stressed that “now is the moment for maximum vigilance” amid increasing calls for tougher lockdown restrictions. The confusion arose after police appeared to step up action against people they considered to be flouting Covid restrictions.

Just % of England is represented by a parish or town council, compared with % of Wales and % of Scotland, according to a study by the think tank Onward. Its report, The Policies of Belonging, says ministers would help to meet their “levelling up” pledge by firing up local democracies. Backed by charities and a cross-party group of MPs, the study says communities should be given powers to help “secure land for community-led housing to ensure a supply of local affordable or social homes”.Onward director Will Tanner said: “Everyone focuses on the impact of lockdown on the economy but the truth is that the pandemic has taken a terrible toll on the social fabric of our lives, compounding the long-term decline of community over recent decades. “As we emerge – finally – from the pandemic, we need to not just revive a flatlining economy, we need to take steps to empower and recapitalise communities, to give people back a sense of belonging and rekindle the social networks and institutions upon which we all rely.” Onward says that when the Government publishes its plans for more devolution, “ministers should pave the way for the widespread introduction of town and parish councils, while also giving town and parish councils the right to assume ownership of, and responsibility for, green spaces, community sports facilities, community centres and local high street maintenance in their area”. It also calls for a Year to Serve scheme where unemployed young people would be given paid placements with local charities or social businesses. “To mitigate the long-term scarring of unemployment and to build upon the wave of volunteering during the pandemic, the Government should pay young people the national minimum wage to serve their community,” says the think tank. Jobs could include teaching nursery-age children, working in care homes, planting trees, or teaching migrants English."},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock rules out covid","story":"NewsMatt Hancock rules out Covid- bubbles being scrapped as lockdown rules tightenedThe Health Secretary told the Mirror he “can rule out” removing the measures, which have become a leline for many families since they first launched last JunemirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video daily-mirrors-dan-bloom-questions-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

They also allow a couple who have a child under one to join with a household of any size. Childcare bubbles allow a similar arrangement between one household and another that has a child under .

If you’ve bubbled with somebody, that is the person you’ve bubbled with. “You cannot keep moving bubbles - that is very important.”It comes after Boris Johnson threatened tighter coronavirus curbs - but said he didnapost want to introduce them.Keir Starmer said new measures may be needed within  hours and claimed the Prime Ministeraposs dithering had “cost lives”."},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock says uk worst","story":"NewsMatt Hancock says UK at worst point of pandemic with tighter lockdown rules possibleNHS England medical director Stephen Powis warned hospitals will not see reductions in coronavirus admissions until February as the Health Secretary refuses to rule out taking further actionit is neededmirrorShareCommentsByJoseph WilkesReporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video health-secretary-matt-hancock-asks-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

He said there are , people in hospital with the coronavirus across the UK, while daily admissions are above the first wave.Hancock told the Downing Street press conference: Weaposre at the worst point of this pandemic. A total of , hospital admissions of people with Covid- in England were reported for January , NHS England figures also showed. This is slightly below the record number of , admissions reported for January , but up % on the equivalent figure a week ago on January .

The number comprises all patients admitted in the previous  hours who were known to have Covid-, plus any patients diagnosed in hospital with Covid- in the previous  hours. There have been  deaths on average each day over past week, Hancock revealed.

He told the press conference that the new iant of coronavirus is “highly contagious and it is putting the NHS under very signicant pressure”. Mr Hancock echoed England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty in saying “we’re at the worst point in this pandemic”. And he said: “The NHS, more than ever before, needs everybody to be doing something right now - and that something is to follow the rules. “I know there has been speculation about more restrictions, and we don’t rule out taking further actionit is needed, but it is your actions now that can make a dference.  “Stay at home, and please reduce all social contact that is not absolutely strictly necessary. That’s what is needed: act like you have the virus.” NHS England medical director Stephen Powis warned Hospitals are under signicant and sustained pressure. He added: The vaccine is not a free pass to ignore national guidance. Meanwhile Hancock admitted scientists do not yet knowthe extent to which a vaccinated person can transmit the virus to another person.  Hancock said: “We don’t yet know how much one may transmit Covid after a vaccine.” He added: “The lting of restrictions depends on achieving targets on vaccination plus getting over s inoculated.” While Professor Powis added: “We are not going to see reductions in admissions until February.” The National Medical Director for England has said that seven vaccination hubs and more than , pharmacies are gearing up to start delivering Covid- jabs. Professor Stephen Powis said that , pharmacies in England alone will join the vaccination roll-out. “We will then kick off another sprint up to April as we get the rest of the vulnerable groups protected and finally a marathon to the autumn as we deliver vaccination to everyone ,” he said. He added that, apart from social distancing and Covid- safety measures, “these vaccines are the best line of defence that we have as we continue this battle against coronavirus”. So far, . million people have received a Covid- vaccine first dose, . million people have been vaccinated with first dose in England, , in Scotland, , in Wales, , in Northern Ireland.

It officially opened as Liverpool Irish Centre on February , , with the stage playing host to music and drama performances, while the location was also used by clubs and societies as a meeting spot.Jake Parr, a -year-old urban explorer, recently took his camera behind the doors and shared photos of the eerie large, abandoned rooms he found inside.

Officers spotted the person at Cheddar Gorge in Somerset with six other people on Saturday.Avon and Somerset Constabulary said on Twitter that the unidentied culprit had travelled from Bristol - around a -mile journey.People are being asked to stay at home or as local as possible to protect the NHS under current COVID- rules. Posting on social media, the force said: Travelling from Bristol to Cheddar to sit and eat kebabs in your vehicle is not a reasonable excuse! #staysafe.A further statement to Somerset Live added: Police patrolling in Cheddar [on Saturday] engaged with a number of people who were sitting in parked cars in Cheddar Gorge.Officers took the decision to issue fixed penalty notices to seven iniduals whom they determined were not local to the area, were not members of the same household, and did not have a valid reason for their journey under the current COVID- regulations. We would ask that people follow the regulations, only travel when it is essential and take exercise locally to their home address, in order to save lives and protect the NHS.Current coronavirus rules state: aposYou must not leave your home unless you have a reasonable excuse .aposIf you need to travel you should stay local - meaning avoiding travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live - and look to reduce the number of journeys you make overallapos. The news comes as several other rule-breakers were reported over the weekend - including another group who thought it acceptable to travel to a beauty spot. Police fined two car loads of pals who had driven  miles to hang out at Lulworth Estate in Dorset - and turned them straight back aroundEach person was slapped with a £ charge while clocking up up a fruitless  miles, reports Coventry Live - but apparently seemed blasé about the incident.A spokesperson for Lulworth Rangers, who help to run the estate, said: This lot had travelled down for Coventry for a day out at a beauty spot but unfortunately for them they arrived at the same time as the police.  I was gobsmacked at what they had done. They were blatantly ignoring the rules. It was shocking. There were eight of them in their s spread over the two cars. They were very blasé about the whole thing, even when they were given the £ fines each. Meanwhile officers in Whitby have hit out after hearing reports people had gone to neighbouring areas to enjoy fun in the snow - and asked them to avoid sledging. The local force posted: We are receiving reports that people are journeying to Goathland and the surrounding areas to sledge. This is in contravention of the current lockdown and government guidelines around necessary travel and the public should not attend and risk a fine. And a pub landlord in Worcester says he was visited by police for breaching coronavirus laws - after he handed out a free pint to a delivery man dropping off beer. Colin Robinson, who runs the Chestnut Tree Inn, was paid a visit by officers as part of the ongoing tough crackdown. Officers took down his name and details when they arrived at his premises last week - but he has not yet heardhe will be fined or not.  Mr Robinson claimed one person was using the recording studio upstairs while he had given another man a free beer for dropping off a barrel.But police have also faced some criticism for being strict on enforcement in other areas."},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine calculator predicts your","story":"NewsWhen will I get the Covid vaccine  Calculator predicts your position in the queueWith two Covid jabs now being used in Britain, many people are wondering when it will be their turn.

Both vaccines need to be given in two doses which are now set to be given  weeks apart in a bid to give more people their first shot sooner. It is hoped the Oxford vaccine in particular will lead to tens of millions of people to be inoculated by April and drive down coronavirus cases, which would also help unlock Britain from constant lockdown restrictions. With two coronavirus vaccines now available in Britain, it has naturally left people wondering when they will be inoculated. When will I get the Covid vaccine A new online calculator predicts your likely position in the queue after asking a series of questions.The omni calculator asks for your age, whether you live or work in a care home, are pregnant or plan to be in the next three months andyou’re a frontline health or social worker, classes as extremely vulnerable or have an underlying health condition.Once answered, it will give an estimate on how many people are ahead of you in the queue. Explaining that this is only a predicted estimate, the omni calculator site reads: We also indicate how long it might be before you get the vaccine, based on the vaccination rate. “By default, we base these figures on a vaccination rate of  million vaccinations a week and a default uptake rate of .%.” “As more data on the actual vaccination rate is released, we may revise this default value.” The calculator also has an advanced mode that allows you to change the vaccination rate and uptake figure.

Mohamud Mohammed Hassan, , was arrested on suspicion of breach of the peace on Friday night and taken to Cardf Bay Police Station. He spent the night there before being released without charge at .am the following day. Emergency services were then called to an address in the Welsh capital at just after .pm on the Saturday evening, with police confirming today that Mr Hassan had died. A fundraising page launched to support his family has already raised more than £, to raise money for the funeral and legal fees - with supporters calling for answers. South Wales Police said it was investigating the sudden and unexplained death of Mr Hassan in a statement. It said: Police were called by the Welsh Ambulance Service to a multi-occupancy property on Newport Road, Roath, shortly after .pm. Mr Hassan had been in custody at Cardf Bay Police Station the previous night following a disturbance at the same property. He was arrested on suspicion of breach of the peace and later released without charge which is normal procedure for this offence. Mr Hassan left custody at around .am on Saturday morning. His death has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as death after police contact and we are arranging thev deployment of a family liaison officer to Mr Hassan’s family. As part of the South Wales Police investigation CCTV and body worn video has already been, and will continue to be, examined. This will assist in establishing and understanding the events that took place. Early findings by the force indicate no misconduct issues and no excessive force. We are aware of the extensive reporting on social media but due to the on-going investigation and referral to the IOPC we are unable to comment any further at this stage. A post-mortem examination is due to take place tomorrow and until a cause of death has been confirmed we would urge against speculation. An Independent Office for Police Conduct spokesperson said: We are assessing the referral to determine whether the IOPC needs to be involved in an investigation. Lee Jasper, a human rights activist, said the family deserve answers. He said: When it comes to suspicious deaths in custody there is no justice in this country. We continue to be treated like third class citizens in a supposed first class democracy. As a consequence we see fundamental repetition of the same scenarios and fundamental breaches of our human rights."},{"url":null,"title":"map shows super hubs gps","story":"NewsNew map shows everywhere in England offering coronavirus vaccines - see nearestA map illustrating all the hospital hubs, GPs and vaccination centres where you can a jab against Covid- has been published as the government rolls out its mass immunisation planmirrorShareCommentsByClaire Gilbody-Dickerson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video people-queue-receive-covid--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The couple moved out of their Kensington Palace home when Meghan Markle and Prince Harry offered them their Windsor house after they moved to the US. However after just six weeks, Eugenie and Jack moved back to Royal Lodge in mid December, claims Finding Freedom author Omid Scobie.Speaking to ABCaposs Maggie Rulli, he said: We saw something in the news a few weeks ago about how Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank had moved into Frogmore Cottage. Harry and Meghan had opened the doors to the home to the couple and then mysteriously there was a report that said they had moved out. And no one really knew exactly where they were. However he explains that itaposs now known that they spent Christmas at Royal Lodge. The York family home, which Andrew and Fergie still share despite being orced, has  rooms and a huge amount of land - so there is more than enough room for them all to live together. As England has now entered a third lockdown, the move means Eugenie and Jack are likely to be at Andrew and Fergieaposs for the foreseeable future. However itaposs not much of a change, as they spent the first lockdown there last summer.  The coupleaposs first child is due in the next few weeks. Last year, Fergie spoke about how much she had enjoyed spending more time with her youngest daughter and son-in-law during the first lockdown. Chatting on the City Island podcast, she said: During this lockdown period Iaposve really loved spending more time with Eugenie and Jack. My daughter got married to Jack in, oh goodness, was it last October  No, it was October before, heavens!  And so, of course once sheaposs gone to get married, they live away. So, I havenapost seen her so much and so now itaposs been a total joy to spend real quality time with her. Eugenie and Jackaposs decision to move out of Frogmore reportedly left staff baffled.A source told The Sun : It is empty again. Why does no one want to live in Frogmore Cottage  What is wrong with the place  Harry and Meghan Markle spent £.m of taxpayersapos money having Frogmore Cottage refurbished before they decided to quit the royal family last year.They have since paid the cash back and agreed to let Eugenie and Jack move in to start their family. The two couples reportedly came up with the plan themselves, leaving senior members of the royal family blindsided. The Grade II-listed home, built in , is owned by the Crown Estate. It has been empty for about a year, despite latest figures suggesting , people sleeping rough on a typical night.  The stunning house is just up the road from Windsor Castle, where the Queen and Prince Philip spent all of the lockdowns. The house has empty since Harry and Meghan decided to quit the royal family and move to the US, where they have now bought a new house. A source previously told the Sun on Sunday: Senior royals were initially blindsided by the idea for Harry and Meg to let Eugenie and Jack move in. Obviously the Queen was told after the couples had spoken about the plan.

The princess shocked a group of musicians at the Music College of the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne, Australia, when she sat at the piano and started playing Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No . Her incredible show came after Prince Charles was asked by his former cello teacher to play a few notes while he and his former we were on their  royal tour of the country. The Prince of Wales accepts and delights those around him by playing a few notes. Are you a fan of Princess Diana  Let us know in the comments below But he then abandons the task and the tutor turns to the princess. He asks her to play the piano, said to be her forte. The princess, dressed in a dazzlingly elegant black and white suit and a matching hat, looks reluctant at first.But after some persuasion she gives in and takes to the keyboard to play what the ITN newsreader described as complicated music. The shy-looking princess cuts it short and gets up from the piano stool. The broadcaster described how a modest Diana hurried to escape the spotlight as he said: “She almost ran for cover, clearly embarrassed at her musical debut. The incredible footage is topped off by the moment the impressed tutor stamps a congratulatory kiss on the royalaposs cheek after the unexpected performance.

Tahlia Paris, , from Los Angeles, Calornia, joined the dating app after her last relationship ended as she found out her partner had been married. The Playboy model has been single for four years and was hoping that online dating would be the solution to finding a man to spend her le with. But instead of date requests, Tahlia claims she received an email from Bumble when her photos were removed by the appaposs moderators – which the model believes was due to her looking too hot as they did not break the guidelines. Do you think Tahlia is too hot for Bumble  Let us know in the comments section However in response, the company referenced shirtless bathroom mirror selfies and said it prohibits photos of people indoors wearing swimsuits or underwear.Influencer Tahlia, who has , followers on Instagramand an OnlyFans account, where she regularly posts saucy snaps for her fans, insists the Bumble profile images were very PG – with each one showing her fully-clothed.“I was on the app for not even a few hours because pictures I tried posting to my profile were removed even though they were normal photos,” said Tahlia, who also works as a DJ. “It happened three or four times to dferent pictures and Bumble only allowed one of my pictures to stay up, which was really hurting my odds in the dating app world. “The photos I posted very were basic. One was a selfie of myself, one was a picture a friend of mine had taken at the beach. “I tried to keep it very PG and not model-esque at all.  I wanted guys to not stop at my profile because I’m a professional model but because I was just another average girl looking to date. “I even kept my Instagram and everything private and separate from Bumble. I’ve had guys in the past solely try to hook up with me because of my presence on social media.  “When turned down, a few of their responses were like ‘but wait, you model for Playboy’ – asthat was something that made it easier to have sex with me.” Tahlia, who is based in Los Angeles, joined Bumble after struggling to meet people due to the pandemic and was hoping to find companionship through the app. She said: “In LA, everything is completely shut down due to Covid, so I thought I would have better odds finding someone to spend time with on an app rather than hoping to meet someone at the grocery store.  “At first I was upset when they closed my account because why should I have to suffer because others have made fake accounts of me  “But at the same time I was a little relieved because online dating for the first time was a little bit nerve-wracking.” Tahlia’s Bumble account may have been real but the model has been targeted by catfishes using her pictures in the past, though not on a dating app.  Itaposs such a big problem it has even led to death threats. She said: “There are several ‘impersonation’ accounts of me all over Instagram. One has nearly half a million followers. “They make their money by stealing my photos and using my name to fraudulently sell stuff online – everything from ‘used lingerie’ to dodgy diets and workout plans.  “When these people don’t receive the items they paid for they would email me personally with death threats, asking me to give them whatever they had ordered.” After all she has been through during her short-lived stint on Bumble, Tahlia isn’t surethe dating app world is for her. She added: “Online dating has never really been something I’m into but in these circumstances, I thought I’d try it and it didn’t work out. Maybe it’s for the best.  “I would have to start all over with a new account and I’m not sure it’s worth it at this point. “For now I’m at a stand-still with dating sadly, but hopefully things will open soon so I can get back out into the normal dating world.” A Bumble spokesperson said: In , we banned shirtless bathroom mirror selfies in response to feedback from our Bumble community – and after our research showed that profiles including those kinds of photos were the most swiped left on.  As part of that overall policy, our photo guidelines prohibit photos of people indoors wearing swimsuits or underwear. Swimsuit photos are acceptableyouaposre outside by the pool or on the beach as youaposre in a natural setting to be wearing a swimsuit.

The youngster, who was reportedly suffering from dry skin, was given the cream by his parents. But they soon realised something was wrong as he shot up in size and his face started growing hair, including on his forehead. The baby was hospitalised after two months of taking the cream. Medics said they were baffled after being told by the parents that the only food he was receiving was his motheraposs breast milk, which was tested and found to be normal. They then asked the parents to reduce the food intake, but a month later the problem was even worse. The child was transferred to a specialist hospital where a couple of similar cases had emerged. Doctors drew a link between them and the Yulin Multi-effect Special Antibacterial Cream, reportedly used in each incident. An examination of the product found that it contained of clobetasol propionate.  They discovered that the cream contained the corticosteroid known as clobetasol propionate which should only be used for short-term use.

He was outstanding.“I thought my goalkeeper Jack Hamilton deserves credit as well after making a great save in the first half.”The Dundee boss, however, wasn’t so complimentary about the penalty decisions given by referee Gavin Duncan that gave Bonnyrigg the lead twice.McPake said: “How the first one is a penalty, I’ll never know.“The second one, I don’t know. The first was nothing short of a disgrace.“We don’t want to take the shine off Bonnyrigg by complaining about penalties, though.“Their performance warranted a live game on TV so they could show why they are doing so well in their league and why the Lowland League is a good one.“It didn’t show the best of us, we know that.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time. All walks are undertaken at your own risk. Please continue to adhere to current guidelines as set out by the government, exercise responsibly and use appropriate clothing and equipment for your chosen outdoor activity. Inform a contact about your route whereabouts. Don’t forget your phone, snacks, drink, any medication first aid supplies you may need and to check weather conditions. Most walks are dog friendly but please keep your dog under close control, especially around livestock and wildle.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures a look back at 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the years which followed, that death toll rose by thousands as people succumbed to radiation sickness.Among those who died was Sadako Sasaki, a pupil at Hiroshima’s Noboricho Elementary School, who developed acute leukaemia  years after being exposed to the radiation.While she was in hospital, she was inspired by the Japanese tradition that suggestssomeone makes a thousand origami cranes, their wish will come true. Sadako’s final days were spent folding paper cranes # hoping she would recover.After her death, her friends swore to build a monument in her honour, and their efforts led to the Children’s Peace Monument. Today, children around the world send more than  tonnes of paper cranes to the monument – more than the combined weight of Little Boy and Fat Man .The paper cranes are recycled by Peace Minds Hiroshima and sent to children around the world with Sadako’s story, raising awareness of the need for peace and nuclear abolition.Blessing the crane sculpture, Fr Ronald quoted from Pope Francis# World Day of Peace statement: #How many resources are spent on weaponry, especially nuclear weapons, that could be used for more signicant priorities such as ensuring the safety of iniduals, the promotion of peace and integral human development, the fight against poverty, and the provision of health care.#Global problems like the present Covid- pandemic and climate change have only made these challenges all the more evident. What a courageous decision it would be to establish a #Global Fund# with the money spent on weapons and other military expenditures, in order to permanently eliminate hunger and contribute to the development of the poorest countries.#Fr Ronald added: #On January , the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons will enter into force. This is a milestone on the road to peace.#The crane was gted to St Margaret’s peace garden by Pax Christi Scotland chairwoman Marian Pallister and crafted by Lochgilphead blacksmith Jack Campbell to remind us to continue to strive for peace, and as Pope Francis reminds us, #…to esteem the value and dignity of every person, to act together in solidarity for the common good, and to bring relief to those suffering from poverty, disease, slavery, armed conflicts, and discrimination#.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a creative blast from scotlands past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Searching for innovative ways to reconnect with audiences at home and abroad TWTC’s creative director Sadie Dixon-Spain created the ‘Clanagram’, creating paid employment for actors, and producing virtual keepsakes for audiences.Clanagrams are personalised video greetings, sending friends and family near and far love and good cheer, as TWTC’s team of professional actors bring to le a selection of Scotland’s great names.An ideal gt for those with Scottish heritage, Scots in exile, or simply lovers of all things Scottish – it is a unique message from a Scottish hero, sent to them directly to celebrate a special occasion, or simply just to make them smile.Visit www.clanagram to become a member of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s army and receive a message from the Young Pretender himself, a recitation of poetry by the national bard, or a tale from Scotland’s most famous outlaw, Rob Roy.The arts have suffered immensely due to the Covid- pandemic, while tight restrictions continue to press pause on the live events industry. With the creation of digital performances and offerings such as Clanagrams, TWTC aims to continue finding innovative ways of performing, bringing theatre back to audiences, and offering creative professionals employment once again.WEST KINTYRE:Nothing blows away the cobwebs like a walk along Westport Beach on Kintyre#s west coast.The beach, the longest in mainland Argyll, is one of the jewels in Kintyre#s crown and usually draws surfers and tourists from near and far all year round.At the moment, however, under the strict new lockdown measures which limit travel, it is much quieter than usual and is frequented mainly by walkers, runners and dog-walkers living nearby.This photograph, taken by Mid Argyll-based amateur photographer Aileen Gillies in December, shows not only the beach#s rugged coastline but also its wild beauty."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Local beat group, the Sloe-Gin, will play at the dance without charge on Friday, January .Mr McKinley hopes to have the raffle on the way by the beginning of next week.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGONew Year holiday attractionsThe entertainments arranged in town for the New Year holidays present attractions of an ample and ied description.Out of doors football holds the field, a series of interesting games have been arranged for both for New Year#s Day and the following Monday.The evenings can be pleasantly filled by a series of entertainments of great promise, while an exceptionally large exhibition of poultry, pigeons, cage birds and rabbits has been organised by the Campbeltown Ornithological Society.The local Picture House management have made very complete arrangements for the crowds who are sure to include in the holiday rounds a visit to ‘the pictures’.During Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, continuous shows will be given from  o#clock in the afternoon, doors opening at ..The principal picture for Saturday is entitled ‘In the Hollow of Her Hand’ and it will be supplemented by a number of other interesting films both topical and humorous.A change of picture will be made on Monday and again on Tuesday when the principal films will be ‘The Judgement of the Desert’ and ‘The Merry-Go-Round’ respectively.The latter will be continued on Wednesday, and will be followed on Thursday, Friday and Saturday with a striking film entitled ‘The Snares of Paris’.This ied programme will be welcomed by patrons and should result in sustained interest in shows at the Picture House during the holiday period.On New Year’s night, a concert will be given in the Victoria Hall under the auspices of the local branch of the Comrades of the Great War.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s. Filming his personal and professional le, he helped produce an emotional deeply personal documentary “Critical: Inside Intensive Care Coronavirus” episode, broadcasted by BBC Wales and included among American Society of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine teaching materials.A Belfast community worker is celebrating “the surprise of his le” after being honoured. Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.”A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit. Watching how people come together to support each other has been incredible.”Involved in active frontline response to COVID- in Hampshire as a Refugee Support staff member, Crisis Response South East tactical cell weekend coordinator and local Emergency Response, City of Sanctuary and Cycling UK volunteer, Golam received his accolade for outstanding achievements in healthcare during the virus pandemic.“I don’t do my job – or my volunteering – for praise,” said the father-of-two. “I do it because,the tables were turned and I was the one that needed help, then I would hope that there was someone out there to support me. “I’d like to dedicate my award to everyone in all communities who are helping others.”For more information on Honours recipients, go to gov.uk honours"},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"meet kintyres heroic davids","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Following enforced shut-down in March , CPH was able to re-open from September to December, one of very few cinemas in the UK to do so.At CGS, Mr Fyfe had to consider the iety of needs of the school#s children and their parents, his own needs and those of his family as he supported the entire network of staff, which includes several more Davids # music teacher David Cosgrove and maths teachers David Hamilton and David MacDonald.The heroic work of all the school#s staff through lockdown ranges from supervising vulnerable and key workers# children in the HUB and the challenges of online learning, to packing and distributing food parcels and delivering hot lunches in the community.As leboat coxswain, Mr Cox leads a crew which includes several heroic Davids # David Mullen, David Ward, David Campbell, David Colville and David Reid.Despite still having to attend all call-outs, in full kit and PPE, the team#s training came to a halt soon into the first lockdown, but they were eventually able toto training on a two-week rotation, one week on land, the other offshore.Having to physically distance proved incredibly hard for the crew, with multiple people required to safely carry out some tasks.Even small rescues using the Y-Boat # the vessel on top of the Severn-class leboat, not to be confused with the inshore rescue boat which is towed on a trailer # presented challenges given the amount of space on the boat.Masks were, and continue to be, worn inside the wheelhouse at all times and when working closely together outside on the deck.These Davids # and, of course, so many other people in the community # helped navigate the community through unprecedented and challenging circumstances in many dferent ways.If you know of a heroic David who deserves a shout-out, please let us know by emailing editor@campbeltowncourier or telephoning  .CAPTIONS:David Cox.

The project will act as a window into the past, allowing people to discover my dad’s temporary installations, which were often his most ambitious and influential works.#So we#re asking the public # communities, artists, curators, critics, welders, shipbuilders, school pupils# anyone who worked with my father, who remembers his temporary installations, or knows the whereabouts of public sculpture, to contribute to this project by sharing their stories.#"},{"url":null,"title":"coppersmith-george-cairns-releases-cairns-scotch-whisky-liqueur","story":"George Cairns, of East Loan, worked with food technologists at Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh to create Cairns Scotch Whisky Liqueur, which combines blended malt whisky, elderberries and Highland heather honey.George began his career as a coppersmith in  as an apprentice with McMillan, the copper pot still specialist in Prestonpans, making stills and whisky distillery equipment.He progressed to a career in education on the subject, teaching his trade at the University of Edinburgh before working to develop his own drink.He said: ldquoIrsquove always had an interest in whisky all my le, from working in the distilleries, being a consumer, and Irsquove always been involved in some way or another.ldquoIt was an idea that came to me some years ago I spent some years working with the food technologists at Queen Margaret University to develop the method and get the formula just right.His whisky liqueur was ready to sell in February but launch plans were forced to a halt by the coronavirus lockdown.George said: ldquoThe Covid- pandemic impacted on the proposed launch of the product but a soft local launch on social media resulted in steady sales and excellent consumer feedback.George commissioned chocolatier-patissier Sebastian Kobelt to create a limited-edition cranachan truffle to complement the Christmas sales of the whisky liqueur.With hopes it will be on sale in shops early next year, Cairns Scotch Whisky Liqueur can be bought online from www.cairnsscotchwhiskyliqueur"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-foodbank-boosted-donation-charity-elcap","story":"The money, which would have been used to pay for catering at ELCAPrsquos annual general meeting in October, was made available by the Prestonpans-based social care organisationrsquos Covid-enforced decision to move its AGM online.Paul White, ELCAP chief executive, said: ldquoIn a normal year, wersquod welcome delegates to our AGM with coffees, teas and a bite to eat.ldquoWhile we really missed seeing everyone, we thought wersquod donate the money we saved to a good cause in East Lothian.ldquoRecent research from the Trussell Trust forecast a  per cent rise in demand for food parcels between October and December this year.ldquoWith that in mind, we thought it right to support our local foodbank with a small donation.Candace Higgins, East Lothian Foodbank director, said: ldquoAt East Lothian Foodbank, we do our utmost to provide the best possible food to people restricted by poverty.

But as it got dark the moon came out and Peter saw strange shapes on the hillside. They were moving slightly and he couldnrsquot decide what they were. It seemed they were crawling towards him. It wasnrsquot a wolf but he became very scared.So he blew the horn as hard as he could. He heard the sound of shouting and running feet as his father and other villagers came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked Peterrsquos father.ldquoI donrsquot think they are wolves but therersquos something scary over there, he replied. His father looked and shook his head.ldquoThey are just bushes and trees, swaying in the breeze, explained his father angrily. ldquoYou have called us up here for nothing. Irsquom angry and disappointed in you. Do not do that again.He left with the villagers and reminded Peter: ldquoBlow that horn only when there is a wolf.Peter felt angry and disappointed with himself. But now he understood that it was just the outline of the trees and bushes in the moonlight, so he wasnrsquot scared of the shapes anymore.He sat by the fire eating his supper. It was a warm, cosy fire and it made him miss home and his family. His father had always told him that the warmth of a fire was for sharing, but he had no one to share his with. His head began to fill with stories and riddles, but there was no one to share these with either.He wasnrsquot scared anymore but Peter began to feel lonely. He had the sheep but they couldnrsquot solve riddles or listen to stories like his younger siblings, or sit with him by the fire and share its warmth. The fireside was always a place where his father told stories and his mother sang. Now he was alone and sadness overcame him. Hersquod never felt lonely like this.So he picked up the horn and blew it as loud as he could. Once again, the sound of shouting and running feet was heard as Peterrsquos father and his neighbours came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked his father.Peter looked down at the ground: ldquoWell, therersquos is no wolf, father, itrsquos just I was so lonely by the fire all by myself and...But he didnrsquot get the chance to explain. ldquoThere is no wolf  said his father angrily. ldquoI can hardly believe you have called us up here once again for nothing!Peter looked down at the ground and apologised, and promised he wouldnrsquot call them for nothing again. His father and the neighbours ed to the village in an unhappy mood.Peter settled down by the fire once again but this time he heard growling and when he looked up there really was a wolf. So he blew the horn as hard as he could. But there was no sound of shouting and running feet. So he blew again. Still nothing.So he shouted ldquowolf, wolf! in between blowing the horn, but his cry of wolf was ignored, because his father and the villagers didnrsquot believe him.The wolf seemed to understand the opportunity and so ate or killed all the sheep.rsquoSo the story ended. I sat back and looked at the kids for their reaction.ldquoWell, thatrsquos a dferent way to tell the story are there dferent morals in it  I asked.ldquoWell, Peter did blow the horn when there wasnrsquot a wolf, just like in the story in the book, but it wasnrsquot really for nothing was it  It was because he was scared, and then lonely and sad. It is the same story, but then again isnrsquot, reflected Manja.ldquoItrsquos from a dferent point of view, added Skye.ldquoAnd what morals or lessons do you see in this version  I asked.Well we had quite a discussion and I think an important one for the children at this time.

painting scenes from his home town and from Gullane, Dirleton and the Bass Rock, ranging from the castle ruins of the mighty to the humble cottages of the poor.Since he also liked Dunbar, not less than  of his postcards are from this East Lothian coastal town, which was popular among the tourists in Edwardian times.Some of his cards depict standard sights like the Castle Ruins and the Town Hall one has a quaint little cottage at Cleikum Toll and another the Loverrsquos Walk, a rump of which still exists.One of his most interesting cards , from a historical point of view, depicts the ancient Abbey Ruins at Friarscroft: they were quite a rural scene in Edwardian times, with sheep grazing and some old cottages in the background.This Trinitarian abbey was founded by the Countess of Dunbar in , as one of eight known houses to have been located in Scotland.The abbey still stood in  but it fell into a gradual decline the remaining friars moved away, and most of the stoneware of the church was taken away for local building projects.A  map shows that by this time, only the tower stood, being used as a dovecot.In , a group of archaeologists and antiquaries made excavations near the dovecot tower, finding the original tiled floor of the church, but no trace of an original dwelling-house for the friars anywhere nearby.Since the old friars had built their tower sturdy and strong, it still stands today , looking virtually unchanged since Phillimorersquos time.The only sheep to be found anywhere in the vicinity are the lamb chops for sale at the Co-op supermarket, although the cottages in the background remain more or less unchanged.Friarrsquos Walk, also known as the Monkrsquos Walk of Dunbar, is a more mysterious matter.This structure is still largely in existence, consisting of two parallel ancient sandstone rubble walls stretching southwards from West Port.It has been presumed that Friarrsquos Walk must have some connection with the Trinitarian abbey, and that the part connecting it with West Port is a later addition.The northern part of Friars WalkAlready in Victorian times, Friarrsquos Walk was used to dump rubbish and garden refuse from the gardens of the houses on High Street, but the entirewas passable within living memory.When examined by the archaeologists in , it was largely filled with earth and quite overgrown when I explored it in , things had not improved in the slightest.What might have been, through the deployment of a sergeant-major and  unemployed youngsters armed with shovels and saws, one of the leading tourist attractions of Dunbar has been left to fight a losing battle against decay.There does not appear to be any other instances of ancient double walls with a narrow walkway between them, and the Dunbar local historians have speculated what use had been made of Friarrsquos Walk in olden times.One rather adventurous hypothesis is that the Trinitarian monks used the walls as a walkway from their abbey to another building, perhaps their dwelling-house.When ended at its southern extremityby the construction of a Georgian or early Victorian building, Friarrsquos Walk is heading straight for what is today the grounds of the Priory, my own house in Dunbar.No ancient ruins ever existed in these parts, as far as can be discerned: a postcard from Edwardian times, stamped and posted before work on the Priory was begun in , merely shows farmland and market gardens.Maybe the friars had their garden here, growing fruit and medicinal plants Another speculation is that one of the walls of Friarrsquos Walk represents a substantial fragment of the post-medieval western town wall.Since at least the western wall of Friarrsquos Walk has several blocked doorways, a rationalist would instead suspect that it was intended as a rear lane to the houses on High Street, used for the removal of rubbish and garden waste.The mystery of Friarrsquos Walk is a profound one, and unlikely ever to be solved."},{"url":null,"title":"january-7-coronavirus-figures-update-east-lothian-sixth-lowest-scotland","story":"The most recent data from Public Health Scotland shows that between December  and

Tantalising words indeed. There will be some new gods to get to know too, all wrapped up in a story that is, apparently, more timely than anybody believed possible when work began on it many months ago. But dont worry, there are plenty of old favourites around too, including those played by Ricky Whittle, Emily Browning and Ian McShane.The Silence Moving and disturbing four-part drama, originally shown on BBC One in , follows the story of -year-old Amelia Edwards, who has recently been fitted with a cochlear implant. Desperate to escape from her over-protective parents, Amelia goes to stay with her Aunt Maggie, homicide detective uncle Jim, and teenage, free-spirited cousins Tom, Sophie and Joel. While there she witnesses the murder of a policewoman, a case Jim is eventually assigned to - although he initially doesnt realise his niece may have the information he needs to catch the culprit, and when he does, it becomes clear that Amelias knowledge could put her le at risk. Genevieve Barr, Douglas Henshall, Dervla Kirwan, Hugh Bonneville and Gina McKee head the cast.Finding Joy Its been described as Catastrophe meets Fleabag, which is a heady mix indeed, but theres certainly a taste of both of them in Amy Hubermans le-affirming comedy drama - as well as a heap of originality its also a lot more fun than the latter. If you havent caught the first series yet, make sure you stream that before making a date with the second run. For the initiated, Hubermanplays a newly single woman who, after splitting with her long-term love, gets a big break at work when shes asked to fill in for Irelands favourite blogger. The second run sees her embrace the new Joy, or Joy ., as she puts it. Unfortunately, she hasnt quite got everything she needs for success under control.Miranda Its been a while since Miranda Harts series aired on regular TV and, despite rumours of a revival every now and then, new episodes have so far failed to arrive. Thankfully, then, every episode is now being made available to stream - thats all three series of the sitcom, plus the two-part special finale. Hart takes the lead role of Miranda, a former public school girl who is socially inept and finds it dficult to fit in with members of her peer group - in particular Tilly, who was her childhood nemesis. Miranda also struggles to connect with members of the opposite sex, in particular her hunky former university pal Gary. Tom Ellis, Patricia Hodge, Sarah Hadland and Sally Phillips co-star.Outside the Wire It may sound like a spin-off from David Simons superlative Baltimore-set crime drama The Wire, but this science fiction epic couldnt be further from it. Directed by acclaimed Swedish film-maker Mikael Hafstrom, whose  movie Evil received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, its set in the future and stars Damson Idris as Leo, a drone pilot sent into a dangerous demilitarised zone. Hes assigned to work for a android officer Harp , whose job it is to locate a doomsday device before enemy agents can get their hands on it. Emily Beecham, Michael Kelly and Pilou Asbaek are among the supporting cast.Servant When it comes to creating thrillers with a spooky edge, few do it better than M Night Shyamalan.

Anyone expecting more of the same in A River Called Time can forget it, however: sprawling, ambitious, often thought-provoking and just as often baffling, Newlandrsquos latest novel is as hard to comprehend as it is to forget.Itrsquos set, initially at least, in an alternate London called Dinium on a world called Geb. In a handy timeline, Newland runs through the main historical events in this alternate universe starting with key dates in Egyptian history . Christrsquos le is shortened by  years, and by  AD the Roman emperors are favouring religions based on Kemetian Cosmology. In , a century ahead of schedule, Henry VIII splits with the Roman Kemite Temple and forms an Anglican one then in  therersquos a Flash War in which the original city of Dinium is obliterated.The Dinium of May , when the novel opens, consists of an Outer City and an Inner City which contains The Ark, an apparent sanctuary built in  and to which Outer City residents can movethey qualy . Within The Ark there are Levels, rising to Level Four for the truly blessed and descending five miles down into the ldquoLowers. Citizens sleep in pods which steer and control their dreams. All light is articial.Of course The Ark is a glittering lie. The Levels are split into Zones and in the lowest is the Poor Quarter, whose denizens undertake menial jobs and whose hardscrabble lives are plagued by crime and the authoritarian brutality of the Ersquolul Corporation.Our protagonist is Markriss Denny, or Mark, or Mars or Riss, depending on which of several alternative version of his le wersquore wading through at the time. We first meet him as a child living in the Outer City, mourning the death of his brother and hanging out with his friend, Nesta. He moves to The Ark and becomes a journalist, at least for the first  pages. In the second of the three acts, Markriss, Nesta and Markrissrsquos we Chileshe are now members of The Outsiders, a group of political activists plotting to take on the Ersquolul Corporation.Markriss is subject to visions. At times he leaves his body and moves into an astral plane where he communes with the spirit of Professor Harman Wallace, inventor of the pods. There is much talk of ethereal bodies and of chakras. At one point Markriss lies with ldquoevery hair rising to attention, the subtle atoms formerly at rest above his mortal body awakened, chakras spinning, primed to make a superfluity of connections. So is act one a hallucinatory vision  Does act two take place in an alternate reality, with an alternate Markriss  Is Wallace trickster or guide Act three, the most coherent, takes us to modern-day London where Markriss is writing about his own day-to-day le, real-le events such as the  General Election and also making notes for a long-standing project about The Ark.

Her horns hidden in a tumult of hair, she walks along Constitution Street towards a city that is dark and unheimlich a city populated by beggars, glowering gargoyles and men of the cloth who swoop down the High Street like crows. The year is , but it is an Edinburgh Kidnappedrsquos David Balfour would instantly recognise: a place of hubbub, and of tenements, both multi-storeyed and multi-storied, ldquostanding sentinel around the Tron.In recent years, Edinburgh has plied a trade as a backdrop for the crime novels of Ian Rankin and others. But Fagan plays up the cityrsquos Gothic traits to produce an instant classic. Suffused with dread, Luckenbooth is a perverse love song to its castle and its catacombs its plague victims and its Presbyterianism its hedonism and its haar.The ghost of Robert Louis Stevenson stalks its narrative wynds. Deacon Brodie ndash respectable cabinet maker by day housebreaker by night ndash is the inspiration for Luckenboothrsquos villain Mr Udnam just as he was for Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Fagan acknowledges the debt. She has Flora ndash a trans woman at a sex party ndash remind us that Stevensonrsquos most famous novel was written during a six-day cocaine binge. And Luckenbooth possesses that same frenetic energy the same fever-dream quality found in her debut, The Panoptican, about a teenage girl in care. It is asall the images in Faganrsquos head are engaged in a breathless, deathless race on to the page. References to Hitler, druids, pagans and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse snap at each otherrsquos heels. Witches and assassins, madams and mediums jostle for their place in a universe which, while anchored in a familiar geographical literary landscape, moves to its own wild beat.The Luckenbooth of the title ndash No  Luckenbooth to be precise ndash is a nine-storey building in the heart of the Old Town. It is named after the lockable booths for traders ndash luckenbuiths ndash which stood nearby, but a luckenbooth is also a silver brooch sometimes worn to ward off witches. This is ironic because the tenement is cursed. Jessie has been sold as a surrogate mother to wealthy landlord Mr Udnamrsquos baby. The atrocity that follows works its way into the fabric of the building, rising like damp through its floors, infecting its eccentric residents over the course of almost  years.Faganrsquos conjuring of the tenement is an incredible feat. She creates a literary Windows in the West, providing fleeting glimpses of self-contained worlds: a man at his piano a parrot flying round a room. But more than that, she captures the ebb and flow of humanity, the way we weave in and out of each othersrsquo lives, barely touching.There are the daily routines: ldquoA kettle whistle goes on a stove on the fourth floor each day at am, am, pm and then again at pm, Levi, a black American, who works in the Royal Dick veterinary building, writes to his brother in . But there is also a fluidity, an overlapping of existence the living moving in tandem with the dead. Leitmots create connections. Jessie has a cage around her heart made of ldquobone, bone, bone, Levi sorts animal bones ldquonumerically by size and species, and the tenement has access to the vaults where body-snatchers Burke and Hare once wheeled their victimsrsquo bodies.Like all great Gothic works, Luckenbooth deals in duality: good evil, light dark. The more sins Mr Udman commits, the more philanthropic he becomes. Jessie has her fatherrsquos horns, but stands up against the landlord. Flora has changed from male to female, but is still caught in a biological trap. Copious mind-altering drugs are consumed and sex is had in an impressive range of numerical gender combinations.This duality extends to the setting. Fagan builds on the idea of there being two Edinburghs, ldquoone above ground and one below, one in the centre and one on the outskirts. This duality can be thrilling. ldquoSometimes the sky races in such a way it seems there are two skies from two dferent worlds entirely ndash rushing at each other in opposite directions, layers of cloud and dark moodiness, Levi writes.The lust extends to the setting, too. Fagan comes at Edinburgh like a voracious lover, eager to explore both its conspicuous beauty and its secret places. She runs the gamut of its sinister hotspots: Greyfriars Kirkyard, the execution site on the Grassmarket, the notorious Pubic Triangle. But that is not enough. She wants us to see the city from every angle, in every light, so she sends Flora up the Salisbury Crags. At sunset ldquothey look like they are on fire, Flora says. ldquoThe entire thing turns rose gold.From the top she can see the ldquowhole city skyline sparkle before her. Just as in The Sunlight Pilgrims ndash which features a frozen dystopian near-future in the Highlands ndash Faganrsquos writing sparkles most when she is describing landscape. But she also crams Luckenbooth full of legends. She tells of Robert the Brucersquos heart, cut out so it could be taken to the Holy Land, and of Baska Murmanska, the polar bear mascot of a First World War Polish battalion, led through Leith by war-weary soldiers. Now and then, she tries too hard, and the stories begin to stack up like supermarket BOGOFs but mostly her vivid descriptions keep everything fresh.Luckenbooth is a horror story, originally and beautully told. But it is also a paean to the city Hugh MacDiarmid described as a ldquomad Godrsquos dream. This quote is the bookrsquos epigraph, and Fagan serves it well. Indeed, so fully has she fleshed out MacDiarmidrsquos vision, she may have ruined Edinburgh as a location for Gothic novelists for many years to come."},{"url":null,"title":"susan-calmans-grand-day","story":"Susan Calmans Grand Day Out.Like Wallace and Gromit Kind of.

Yet the built environment where we all live, learn, work and play has been engineered. The question now, as we work towards meeting ambitious net-zero carbon targets, is how do we build, protect, preserve and enhance our landscapes in a sustainable way.We have been considering this challenge for some time now, and in fact we made blue-green engineering a core principle of the Will Rudd approach to design five years ago.We have completely ersied our portfolio of services and the design and engineering solutions have continued to evolve to support the delivery of responsible environmental solutions. The energy market is a very strong sector for us, whether thatrsquos the pound million energy from waste facilities we are working on or the numerous wind farm projects we are currently delivering.We have pushed the boundaries and throw away the traditional rulebooks. Like moving away from the assumption that drainage must be hidden and underground.Instead we are working with the landscape to determine how we can develop above-ground solutions that naturally interact with it to take care of the drainage and flood risk, assessing the geology, energy and hydrology of the area and create a living habitat for us and wildle alike. Like a recent project we worked on where the drainage solution works with the woodland around it, or in planted swales and communal ponds. Delivering sustainable urban drainage systemsserve to capture carbon as well as reduce flood risk.How we improve urban areas too can hugely benefit society and this is a key focus for cities across the UK and Ireland. With demand for housing increasing and a shortage of suitable land, developers are increasingly looking to mixed-use developments where residents can enjoy high-quality living spaces. This is particularly prominent in London where we have worked on tall buildings, up to  storeys. Instead of exploiting every square metre of space for building, we are working collaboratively with architects, landscape architects, planners, developers and contractors to create environments that maximise opportunities for green spaces, both through the preservation of the surrounding areas, and in the creation of new spaces integrated in the fabric of the building, like community roof gardens. These enhanced spaces for social and recreation activities have been proven to deliver health benefits as well as reducing the impact on the environment and are engineered to be resilient to changing climates.The -strong team of experts working across our Glasgow and Edinburgh offices support the creation of positive sustainable environments that we and future generations can benefit from. It is important to us that we play our part in delivering a built environment where people can thrive, and knowing we make a positive contribution to protecting our planet.MJ OrsquoShaughnessy is Managing Director, Will Rudd "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12207447.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gavin-francis-gp-coronavirus","story":"To be a GP at the start of the st century was not so very dferent from being a GP in the s or s. ldquoThere was a kind of timeless feeling about the nature of the work, he tells me.And then this time last year everything began to change.Sunday morning.

I suppose thatrsquos what I mean by intense, because everything was just laden with this stress and with this drama brought by the virus.Clearly, things are not getting better. We are entering this new year with coronavirus cases surging. Francis, like he has been for the last  months, is on the front line.ldquoItrsquos very, very dficult. Where Irsquom working in Edinburgh the hospitals arenrsquot full yet, like the scenes we are seeing in the south-east of England, but they are filling up.ldquoTherersquos a winter beds crisis every year, but this year is so much worse because wersquove got this terrible new respiratory virus to deal with on top of everything .There are a few small upsides, he says. There has been a lot less flu around this winter than normal as a result of all our social distancing. Still, last week he got an email from NHS Lothian asking him and his colleague to do everything within their power to try and prevent admitting patients to hospital.Read More: Grief in a time of pandemicThatrsquos an annual request, he says. However, he adds, ldquoWersquore having to contemplate shutting down routine care yet again. Wersquore becoming a national covid service at the moment.To think back to last January and February now is to recall another world. We lived in a pre-pandemic world and it took us all a while to realise how much was changing. As a GP, Francis and his colleagues had to completely rethink how to deliver care, how to organise their daily practice of medicine. It was a tricky transition.ldquoWe were forced into trying to manage things on the phone because we had no option. Ordinarily my training would tell me you should always see people face to face.Francis had a front-seat view of the spread of the virus. In the book he points out that that last February and March he was very quickly aware of how rapidly the virus was spreading, more rapidly than the government, health boards and the chief medical officer seemed to be acknowledging at the time.ldquoI would hear stories that made me conscious of just how widespread the virus was in the city, Francis recalls. ldquoI was working up in Orkney in February before it had really hit and then, by the time we were into March, it was definitely spreading quite quickly when I was back in my usual practice.ldquoThe government knew that, but I think this was such an unprecedented, explosive situation in terms of controlling the infection that at every stage it feels like the government couldnrsquot quite believe that they were going to have to go to these extremes.ldquoThey couldnrsquot quite believe that they were going to have to close down all the hotels, that they were going to have to shut down flights in and out of the city. At every stage, when it proved we had to do these things, there was an understandable and justiable reluctance to go that extra step, which subsequently proved necessary.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why I think every single Western country has struggled with this virus. The ones that have done pretty well with it in the Far East have got populations that are willing to tolerate a far greater level of state intrusion into their lives.ldquoCountries like the UK are not used to accepting that the state can just lock us up in our own houses for  days.ldquoWersquore not used to having to hand over our personal details every time we visit a pub or a restaurant. Wersquore just not used to that level of state intrusion.Intensive Care is a cool, thoughtful book, and not one, it should be said, particularly interested in blame. ldquoNo, not at all. Itrsquos very easy to look back retrospectively. At every stage I was quite incredulous too. lsquoAre they are really going to have to close all the schools  Are they really going to have to ban flights rsquoWhat he hopes is,this happens again, we will be quicker to close borders and quicker to ramp up mass testing.ldquoGoing forward from this pandemic I think government will be a lot better at keeping pandemic stocks of PPE up to date. Ours had all started to go out of date because they had been stockpiled for the swine flu of .ldquoWe did have access to masks, aprons and so on. We didnrsquot have gowns and the WHO were advising people to wear full gowns.One of the most striking revelations in Intensive Care is how quickly Francis and his colleagues were dealing with a surge in mental health problems as lockdown began. ldquoOne day,  March, almost everything I dealt with related to mental health, he writes.Thatrsquos just two days after Boris Johnson announced a lockdown, I say.ldquoIt was happening so fast, partly because I am in in the city centre of Edinburgh and so much of the economy of that part of Scotland is devoted to tourism. Therersquos a lot of guesthouses there, a lot of people who depend on tourists. And suddenly that was all blown away.ldquoSo, I was seeing the effects of people not just coming to terms with a very dangerous, le-threatening pandemic infection, but also the collapse of their businesses, especially at that time when it wasnrsquot clear what the economic support measures would be. There was a real sense of terror among people who were furloughed or even under threat of redundancy. The uncertainty of that, combined with being ordered to stay home on the pain of essentially risking your le.The impact on our mental health led Francis to join a number of doctors and nurses in writing a letter to education secretary John Swinney to try to get children back into schools.ldquoYou could see the government was doing everything it could to avoid a measurable harm, which was covid deaths among adults because that is a statistic that would be on the front of every newspaper. A terrying statistic. But there were innumerable, less measurable harms still being perpetrated.ldquoI donrsquot envy the politicians making these choices, but, essentially, because the deaths were measurable, everything was done to mitigate that. But there were enormous harms being done by keeping the kids off school, by enforcing everybody to stay home, by the shutdown of massive sectors of the economy. Thatrsquos before we get on to the enormous harm done to the elderly people told to shield and to be away from anybody, to not see their grandchildren for month after month after month. And Irsquom seeing real outcomes of that now, after almost a year of this.ldquoPeople in their late eighties and nineties are saying, lsquoYou know, I might not have many years left and to avoid seeing the people who make my le most worthwhile for so long has been truly terrible, truly dficult.rsquoThe impact on our mental health can also be seen in the rise this last  months of cases of self-harm, panic attacks, and psychosis ndash all, Francis says, on the rise in his own practice.Itrsquos a reminder, I suggest, that being human is about contact and without it we are damaged.ldquoAbsolutely and one of the cruellest aspects of this virus is it spreads through touch and through voice. Singing was one of the worst ways of spreading the virus. Wersquore told to mask up to not touch each other. Itrsquos kind of like an attack on the most basic elements of our humanity.Wersquore being urged to resume clapping for our ldquoheroes again. Francis quite enjoyed the clapping that accompanied the early weeks of the lockdown. Not all of his colleagues felt the same, though.ldquoSome of them hated it. I didnrsquot so much like the clapping, but I really liked the opportunity to chat with my neighbours. If I happened to be home on a Thursday evening and all the neighbours were out on the street, it was quite nice to see each other, four metres apart.ldquoAnd itrsquos interesting how much that amazing upwelling of good feeling towards key workers at that time has kind of dissolved now.Well, indeed. He talks about the scenes of covid-deniers gathering outside hospitals in England with utter incomprehension.ldquoWhat can we do to assure people it is absolutely not a hoax  People are dying of this and the ones that arenrsquot dying of it are very ill, sometimes for a long time. Irsquom not sure how  you can convince people. Itrsquos quite extraordinary to me that people can even deny it exists.Does that make you angry  ldquoNot so much angry. Irsquom absolutely mystied.What the pandemic has reminded us, Francis suggests, is that we are vulnerable. But also, of human ingenuity. ldquoThe ability to create several al vaccines within a few months of this emerging is tremendous, he says.ldquoOn the other hand, itrsquos quite startling to think we havenrsquot progressed in terms of how we best manage and control this kind of viral outbreak. I found that depressing in many ways. In some ways we havenrsquot moved on, for all our sophistication.And so here we are in January , somewhere between hope and fear. Francis leans towards the former. ldquoYeah, Irsquom really hopeful. Irsquom optimistic because we have two vaccines approved for use. Irsquove already had my first vaccination. Irsquom getting my booster later this week. Wersquore vaccinating care homes just now. Wersquore going to vaccinate the over-s very shortly.ldquoThat is the only way wersquore going to get out of this. Wersquore going to get herd immunity through vaccination rather than herd immunity through people having caught and recovered from it.ldquoOf course, it could have been better. Of course, I could point to things that have gone wrong over the last year. Now what wersquove got to do is stick with the measures and vaccinate, vaccinate, to get out of it.Gavin Francis is a GP.

The negotiations that led to the  treaty did not come about directly from the  election, they came about because of the war of independence it was the result not of a peaceful election but of violent action and any attempt to separate the Irish precedent from the violence, which is what Ms Cherry appears to be trying to do, is misleading and wrong.Letrsquos also look at another part of Ms Cherryrsquos commentary. ldquoNo-one wants to replicate the violence that preceded the negotiations, she says, and on the face of it thatrsquos a call for peaceful action. But itrsquos also anti-historical. There wasnrsquot just violence ldquopreceding Irish independence, the violence got worse as independence progressed and developed into years of terrorism. The story of Irish independence is the story of violent ision before, during, and after and there is simply no way of somehow removing or sidelining the violence so it can be used as a peaceful precedent for Scotland.If Ms Cherry needs reminding why Irsquom saying all of this, the recent House of Commons briefing paper, Parliament and Northern Ireland, -, provides useful context. Itrsquos written by the man who wrote this column for many years, David Torrance, and goes through the constitutional history of the island of Ireland in the greatest detail, underlining in the process how long, complex and violent it has been. It also makes the point that a lot of the early history has slipped from public consciousness, which may explain why Ms Cherry feels able to use it as a precedent for Scotland.So why does it all matter  It matters because the SNP is at the point where therersquos an internal battle going on over the best tactics for achieving independence and Ms Cherry is an influential figure in that battle. I would have thought that makes it extra important she gets her history right and thinks carefully about the consequences of using Ireland as a precedent for Scotland. I fear she hasnrsquot done so because of the flaw that runs through so many nationalists.Read more:The Scottish Government is not to blame for the drugs crisisWhat I mean is the idea that it couldnrsquot happen here. Ms Cherry doesnrsquot appear to consider for a minute that the debate in Scotland could ever erupt into violence, but are we sure of that  Many Americans thought the same way before the riots at the Capitol. The SNP MP Steven Bonnar also tweeted recently that ldquowe will fight to the death for our country and I guess your view on whether that sort of comment could ever lead to actual violence will depend on how literal you think Mr Bonnar was being. He said he was joking.I also think anyone who knows anything about the mood in Scotland should be cautious about thinking there could never be violence here in future. Many Scottish nationalists are furious that theyrsquore not getting their own way, but we should also be aware that Scotland has many of the same tensions as Northern Ireland for many of the same reasons: economic, religious, constitutional. The Loyalist bands are stronger and more vocerous in Scotland than ever. And therersquos already been violence. Remember the Glasgow riots in  when the Irish unity march was met by counter-demonstrators  And the arson attack on the Tall Cranes pub in Govan  What makes anyone think that sort of violence could never happen again, or get worse even What Irsquom saying is that the only responsible thing to do here is to make ourselves aware of the historical backdrop before we start suggesting that the answer to Scotlandrsquos future can be found in Irelandrsquos past. Perhaps Ms Cherry should also remember how her party got here in the first place. In her article for The National newspaper, she writes that the SNP is riding high and support for independence is at unprecedented levels, which it is. ldquoWe would never have got this far, she says, ldquohad we hellip not been prepared to be radical and to think outside the box.The obvious implication of Ms Cherryrsquos words is that nationalists need to be radical again and look to apparent alternatives to a referendum, such as Ireland. But the SNP hasnrsquot got here because of radicalism, itrsquos got here because of a wily ability to use every situation to maximise dference and grievance and underline the apparent need for independence ndash in other words, exactly the opposite of radical. Ms Cherry says it is foolish and dangerous to rule out alternatives to a -style referendum. But may I suggest that, from her point of view, it is just as foolish to ignore the reasons why the SNP has reached this historical high.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This must be the focus of all our efforts. The biggest peacetime project in our history.ldquoWe need a round-the-clock vaccine programme, -hours a day, seven days-a-week.

There are plenty of instances where the person saying ldquoWhy should it be dficult just to do X  has a point, and the smart-alec saying ldquoItrsquos a bit more complicated than that is wrong. : Clap for heroes: I want to clap, I really do, but...I thought of this last month when someone made the mistake of writing a tweet along the lines of ldquoIf it were up to me, I would just roll the vaccine out more quickly and then had to spend the rest of the day explaining to hundreds of people whose replies began ldquoActuallyhellipthat it had been, you know, a joke.The more I think about it, however, the more I think he might have been on to something. The vaccines are the one undoubted triumph of the whole coronavirus episode it is extraordinary that they have been developed, assessed, approved and produced in such quantities in the time they have.Most of the credit should go to the scientists and pharmaceutical companies . But a good deal should also go to the government, civil service, and those brought in to manage procurement and delivery. Whatever  has been badly handled, which has been most things, the UK has so far got this right.Things are still terrible, of course probably worse than the first wave. Lockdown continues to be a necessity. Imagine, for a moment, though, what it would be likewe were where we are, but with no vaccine in sight.There is still the possibility that delivery of the vaccine, as opposed to having got one and lined up supplies of it, will be messed up. Indeed, that is the assumption of lots of pessimists. But I confess that my scepticism about the apparent confidence of the government and its advisors was slightly tempered by the fact that the NHS and public health experts ndash even those happy to slate politicians for other failures ndash seem united in the view that the ambitious timetable for actually getting the stuff into peoplersquos arms is, while a huge challenge, not especially unrealistic.If one looks at the track record of Israel, which has inoculated one fth of its population in less than three weeks, itrsquos clear that ndash assuming you have supplies of the vaccine ndash it can be delivered to an awful lot of people very quickly. And the one thing Britain has secured is sufficient supplies. Leaving aside tiresome, point-scoring claims that itrsquos the first clear benefit of Brexit, or any of that rubbish, it is a matter of fact that on this one issue, wersquove so far done better than any other European country ndash almost any country, full stop.: The Irish Border Sea exists, whatever Brandon Lewis saysBut thatrsquos no usewe fluff the delivery. Instead of assuming that the UK or Scottish Government will mess it up, or concentrating on what a huge logistical task it is, itrsquos worth looking at some of the ways in which it might be relatively straightforward, and even ways it could be quicker and easier. We will be constrained by the supply, but neednrsquot be by the logistics.We do a lot of things that involve large chunks of the population without much fuss already. Every election day, about half the population cast their votes somewhere fairly near their home in a few minutes, usually without queuing. The country is not short of community centres, schools, surgeries, libraries, sports stadia, leisure centres and other venues where people could line up, safely socially distanced.The numbers seem daunting, but think of this: , people can pour in and out of Hampden over a few hours Ibrox is as big, Celtic Park even bigger the SSE Hydro holds more than ,. Over a day or two, Glasgow alone could probably vaccinate a couple of hundred thousand people safely.Nor are we short of people qualied to handle it. Even without bringing in, say, the army, there is obvious capacity. Take the infrastructure that lies behind the booking of tickets and the stewarding and management of live entertainment: concerts, sports, festivals. These people handle hundreds of thousands of sales in a matter of hours, book time slots, line up staff. They shepherd enormous crowds around large venues.All those people ndash expert in just such large-scale events ndash are, as it happens, desperate for something to do, since their industries have been shut down.That shut-down is another consideration and why, for once, cost isnrsquot. Lockdown is probably, all told, costing the Treasury more than pound billion every day: last yearrsquos bill was about pound billion. If a substantial chunk of the population were to receive the vaccine by the end of March, someto normality and productivity is a possibility. No matter how much it costs to do this, it is almost certain to be a saving.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Sadly, they have been a particular feature of my experience in politics. Usually, they come from a position of ignorance from those who have never spoken with me and wish to distort something Irsquove said by taking it wholly out of context. I am afraid Mr Smithrsquos column yesterday was typical.It is clear that Mr Smith had not read properly or,he did, had not understood the original article written by me from which he selectively quoted. First, I explained that the ideal method for Scotland to become independent would be after a referendum based on an agreement between the British and Scottish governments as set out previously in the Edinburgh Agreement. Secondly, in the context of exploring whether there might be other legal and constitutional options, amongst other points I identied that there is historical precedent for a country exiting its union with England by a process of treaty negotiation after a majority of pro-independence MPs win an election. That is what happened when Ireland and England entered into the Anglo-Irish treaty in . As might be expected given the subject matter, I went out of my way to stress that no one would want to replicate the violence which intervened and that my reference was to the legal and constitutional precedent.It is of note that the , a newspaper which one might expect to be well acquainted with the matter, reported what I said accurately and without hyperbole or hysteria. I would respectfully suggest that Mr Smith might do well to aspire to their standard of journalism and commentary.If we canrsquot have broader intellectual discussion of political ideas without this sort of ill-informed backlash itrsquos not a good thing for Scottish public debate nor indeed for freedom of speech, of which I know your newspaper is a proud proponent.I set out in further depth some of the legal and constitutional options open to Scotland in my recent keynote address to the Cardf Centre for Governance which can be viewed in full at https:www.youtube watch vxzCGxLPQwU.There is much that is wrong with Mr Smithrsquos column in fact and tone, but my main objection is that in saying that there is a necessity to talk about me he has not taken the slightest trouble ever to speak with me or to properly acquaint himself with my background.Had he done so he would know that I am an Irish as well as a British citizen and as such well acquainted with my countryrsquos history. As the daughter of an Irish woman and of a historian, I was brought up to know and understand the history of Ireland, Scotland and indeed Britain. Accordingly, I donrsquot need an Irish history lesson from Mr Smith nor indeed a lecture on what parallels might or might not be drawn with Scotland.Mr Smith sought to accuse me of ignorance and distortion but that is in fact a charge that is more fairly laid against him for failing to inform himself of the subject about which he chose to write.I donrsquot expect an apology, but Irsquom pleased to put my position on the record.Joanna Cherry QC MP.A DEMOCRATIC AND PEACEFUL ROUTEMARK Smithrsquos article included Irish independence and is a topic well beyond the scope of single articles or letters and writers thereof have no choice other than to be selective. Mr Smith does this by discussing the violence which preceded the years running up to the  Irish election but not the causes of the violence and calls Joanna Cherry irresponsible for citing the Irish election of  as a route for Scottish independence, a sort of Plan B.Whilst acknowledging the violence, Ms Cherry was unwise to use Ireland as a comparator, and caution has to be exercised when discussing Irelandrsquos complex political history. Anyone with the most elementary knowledge of the background to Irelandrsquos independence cannot disassociate the accompanying violence. I do believe Ms Cherry was attempting to illustrate there is precedent for an alternative democratic method other than a referendum for voters to make their wishes known on Scottish independence. Absolutely no one can castigate the SNP leadership for seeking other than a democratic and peaceful route to Scottish independence.Irish unrest went back centuries but a major catalyst, among others at dferent periods of time, was the Famine or Irish Potato Famine starting in resulting in mass starvation with more than one million people dying and many emigrating and the population of Ireland falling by more than % in the period. Good crops continued to be exported across the Irish Sea and the plight caused in Ireland by the famine was largely ignored by Westminster despite many entreaties, until such time as the number of deaths meant it could be neglected no longer. The solutions to Irish problems continued to be ignored by Westminster and played no small part in the early th century history of Ireland.What then are the ways to Scottish independencethere is a clear democratic and sustained majority vote by the people toto being a sovereign country once again Alan M Morris, Blanefield.WE NEED A VELVET DIVORCEldquoA NATIONALIST view of history writes Mark Smith, but it is his nationalist perspective that seems blind. Irish home rule bills were repeatedly vetoed by what Lord Roseberry called ldquothe majority vote of English MPs. This denial of peaceful change, led, eventually, to the collapse of the parliamentary nationalist home rule parties in Ireland to be replaced by Irish Republican Sinn Fein seeking independence. There was violence, many people died in fighting between British forces against Irish, and Irish against Irish. You could argue the Irish civil war only ended with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in .Mr Smith argues Joanna Cherry is wrong to argue against another route for Scottish independence other than a -style referendum. Independence without a referendum worked for Czechoslovakia it looks highly unlikely that any referendum bill for Scotland could get through the Westminster Parliament, never mind any subsequent independence bill, and a Velvet Divorce would avoid much the unpleasantness that is already evident in the metropolitan commentariat.If unionists had expended as much energy finding a solution to Irelands desire for home rule, independence might never have happened. You could argue exactly the same in Scotland since Keir Hardie argued for dominion status for Scotland, but England seems to want us gone, as much as we want to go.GR Weir, Ochiltree.WHY NOT ACCEPT  RESULT I HAD to smile just a little at the irony of Kevin Orrs letterregarding Jill Stephensons letter of January  on Mays elections. He said: \"Ms Stevenson is living in a country that still has a democratic process and she will therefore have to accept the result of that election\". As Mr Orr is clearly of the SNP independence position, did he and his fellow travellers accept the result of the  election  Of course they didnt, despite the overwhelming result ndash  per cent to % ndash against independence.I know that Ms Sturgeon has been presenting herself very well on TV day after day as a more concise leader of her country during this Covid pandemic . However, as a country with the embarrassing record of being sixth-worst for deaths in the world, an education system on the point of collapse, a health service which cannot cope, local government desperate for some of the millions of pounds which the Scottish Government has kept from it, failed policies such as the Named Person and football bigotry policies, why would anyone want to praise Ms Sturgeons Government  And thats before we even consider the road that independence would take us down. Have we not learned from that other nationalist action ndash Brexit, and the damage that it has done to all the UK Councillor Eileen McCartin , Paisley.THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICITMAY I improve on Mrs Freddie Dales statisticsby adding a couple more  Seventy-five per cent of Scottish voters did not vote Tory and yet we have a Tory Government in the UK, and % of Scottish voters voted Remain and yet Scotland is out of the EU.This is known as the democratic deficit and to continue to support it, as Mrs Dale seems to, is fundamentally anti-democratic. I hope that she will eventually come round to a better understanding of democracy.John Jamieson, Ayr.Read more: Independence: Joanna Cherry: A nationalist view of history that raises a worrying vision of the future"},{"url":null,"title":"full-impact-christmas-lockdown-easing-yet-seen-covid-case-numbers","story":"Professor Stephen Powis was speaking at the Downing Street press conference today when he explained the countryrsquos fight against Covid- was now ldquotougher than it has ever been.He said hospitals may still be under strain until February, and explained the number of patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus has risen by a third in less than two weeks.The national medical directorof NHS England was joining UK Government Health Secretary Matt Hancock at todayrsquos briefing to discuss more about the mass vaccination programme ongoing across the country.He said: \"The public should be a no doubt that this fight is tougher than it has ever been.ldquoSince Christmas Day there are ,, more patients in hospital with COVID- and in less than a fortnight into , the number of people in hospital with COVID has already gone up by a third - a rise of around .He said the infections have been ldquostubbornly high and added: ldquo We are seeing stubbornly high levels of infection, and unfortunately deaths too, which is sadly an inevitable consequence of the rapid spread of the virus in recent weeks.ldquoHospitals throughout the country and are seeing signicant and sustained pressure from those rising numbers of COVID- patients.

In many areas the Glow portal is being used to communicate with teachers.It has emerged that Glow service managers have been working with Microsoft to try and get a \"bug fix\" to resolve issues with the communications tool Teams which they are relying on since December .Schools as well as parents across Scotland yesterday reported problems in children accessing remote learning, particularly when using the Microsoft Teams app within the Glow system.At pm, as schools were closing, schools were being told some users were still experiencing issues with the Microsoft Teams service.:Coronavirus: Schools not ready for online learning\"We can confirm that the Glow team continue to work closely with the Senior Microsoft Account team on the issues being experienced. We are confident that the relevant technical teams are fully engaged and we hope to be able to provide an update as information becomes available,\" the Glow update said.Earlier in the day, schools were told that the issues were the result of Microsoft experiencing issues with Teams across the UK and that initial reports indicated this may be specic to users based in the United Kingdom and Northern Europe.Down Detector, the website that monitors outages showed that the number of issues with Teams registered across the UK reached a peak at .am when there were  reports made over a  minute period. Glasgow and Edinburgh were among the hotspots.Two in three were complaining about server connection issues, while one in five said there were issues with logging in.The Scottish Government said it was a Microsoft Teams issues and was not unique to Scotland or indeed to schools.\"Microsoft has confirmed that this issue is affecting users in the UK and where in northern Europe.

That work will continue over the course of next week and for as long as is necessary.\"And on Sunday, education secretary John Swinney said there had been a \"huge amount of work done by educators theand breadth of the country to prepare for remote learning\".

In the meantime please continue to report any issues you experience so we can continue to gather information on the service experienced.\"All children are given a username and password, to give them access to Glow and apps such as Microsoft Office and Teams.Three days before Christmas, managers said they were continuing to work with Microsoft to \"confirm timescales for release of bug fixes\" over the issues. The issues are not yet resolved.Schools across Scotland reported problems and teachers urges pupils and parents not to \"panic\".Lindsay Paterson, a professor of education policy at the University of Edinburgh, said at the weekend that disparities on whether live-streamed lessons will be offered to children in Scotland \"confirm the sense that very little work has been done to prepare for this new situation\". He said remote working could only workschools were actively contacting each pupil - preferably every day and by phone rather than text or email.The   In School campaign has been calling for a national strategy or plan on home learning since June.The Scottish Government said a unorm approach would be \"counterproductive\"..First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reassured parents afte online lessons were disrupted for thousands of learners on the first day of remote learning.Speaking at Mondayrsquos daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon: ldquoLet me begin by acknowledging that today sees many teachers, parents and young people embarking on another period of home-schooling. There are a range of resources and support available however I know some of you might be having an issue this morning with Microsoft Teams.ldquoThis is not an issue that is unique to Scotland or indeed to schools but I understand Microsoft is currently working to address it.ldquoBut more generally I donrsquot underestimate, and I want to be very clear about this, how dficult this both from an educational perspective, how dficult this is for young people.ldquoNot just learning at home but learning away from your friends.Ministers came under for the \"failure\" of the -year-old Scottish schools digital network in the last lockdown.Glow was established as national schools intranet, digitally linking Scotlands , educators and pupils.Managed by Scottish Government quango Learning and Teaching Scotlandit was described as probably the largest such initiative in the world.One report by a music teaching group said that while Education Scotland had Glow set up to lsquolight up learningrsquo since , it was neither al enough nor widely enough used to enable a switch to blended learning in the state system.A Music Education Partnership Group study after the last full lockdown involving over  teachers and tutors,  students,  parents and carers and  youth music organisations in June and July found that \"initial scepticism\" for online teaching generally disappated amongst tutors.A Microsoft spokesperson was unable to confirm when the issue would be rectied yesterday but said: ldquoOur engineers are working to resolve dficulties accessing Microsoft Teams that some customers are experiencing.But at around pm Glow managers told schools they had been advised by Microsoft that \"a number of the wide ranging issues\" experienced with Microsoft Teams have been resolved.\"However, we remain cautious and will continue to monitor closely over coming days to be confident of no further effects of todayrsquos outages,\" they said."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmAn underwater inspection of the NorthLink  freight ship Helliar is to take place after the vessel grounded this afternoon.

The mixing of people on that scale, including the potential movement of tens of thousands of students to university halls and private-rented flats, simply isn’t safe right now. It would fuel the virus, and that is something no one wants.“Our immediate priority right now is to say to students, other than in specic special circumstances, they must notto their campus or term-time accommodation before they are specically told to do so by their institution.“For the overwhelming majority of university students, this means all learning will be online-only at least for January and February, and students should not expect toto campus or student accommodation before the end of February.“We will review plans in light of the state of the pandemic nearer the time, but right now even the very limited number of s that were previously planned for phase two of the restart dates, cannot happen until at least the middle of next month for the majority of students, supported by rapid-result testing on arrival.“We would like to thank everyone for their patience and fortitude in dealing with the pandemic over past months, and we understand this is more dficult news – but we want to give students and staff as much certainty as we can so they can plan effectively. That’s why we are setting this plan out now.“As we have all seen, this virus moves fast and changes quickly but even in light of that reality, hopefully by setting out a clear plan that gives certainly for at least the next two months, everyone can now plan with a greater degree of confidence.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Having a third COVID- vaccine approved for supply following a robust and thorough assessment of all the available data is an important goal to have achieved and I am proud that the agency has helped to make this a reality.#The progress we are now making for vaccines on the regulatory front, whilst not cutting any corners, is helping in our global fight against this disease and ultimately helping to save lives. I want to echo that our goal is always to put the protection of the public first.#Once in use, all COVID- vaccines are continually monitored by the MHRA. This ensures that the benefits in protecting people against COVID- continue to far outweigh any potential side-effects. Meantime, evenyou have had a vaccine it is vital that everyone follows the national lockdown restrictions and remembers ‘stay alert, protect the NHS and save lives’ at all times.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie said the group — which was set up in March last year in response to the first lockdown — was ready to go and in a stronger position this time around.“We’re back to where we were in the first lockdown but we are better prepared having had that experience and we are ready to help with whatever is required in supporting the community — whether that#s picking up prescriptions, delivering food, fuel, any practical support or just advice.Commenting on the group#s work following the initial lockdown, he added: #We put contingencies in place because we were aware that a second phase was likely, so we have a huge store of personal Protective Equipment for the health care sector or anyone  who requires it.“This time it has been a lot easier than the first time, we were reacting to the situation then and learning as we went along, but now we are well prepared.“We are here, we have the phone line, it#s open five days a week but we can scale it up to seven days a weekneeded.”He added: “We have a great bunch of people on board and we connect with all the other operations throughout the island.”A number of food share and emergency food provision initiatives are in operation throughout the island and are advertised locally —you need further advice you can call the helpline.Prior to Christmas Skye Community Response volunteers provided  festive hampers and  presents to members of the community mainly around the Portree and Braes area but also island-wide for Women’s Aid.“Nobody should hesitate in getting touch, the food shares are there to be used, and we are here to help.“We have a robust set-up, and we can also direct people to the relevant support in their area.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3574441.jpg--.jpg?1609941600000\n","title":"cllr mccaughey gifts kells and connor primary school newly refurbished computers","story":"KELLS and Connor Primary School were given an early Christmas gt last week, as DUP Cllr William McCaughey presented two refurbished computers to the school.The computers were refurbished by GSC Computers who were delighted to help.

AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Chief Medical Officer has welcomed the backing of the UK and Ireland#s medical colleges after they said delaying the second dose of Covid vaccinations for medical staff is the right thing to do.Earlier this month Tom Black GP said many doctors were horried over plans to stall by  weeks the second dose of the Pfizer jab to front line staff.After criticism of the UK-wide policy, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges , the coordinating body for the UK and Ireland#s  Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties, issued a statement backing delayed second doses yesterday.Welcoming the intervention, Dr Michael McBride said: The UK-wide decision to reschedule second doses of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine is in line with the authorisation and approval of the MHRAand expert advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .He said it would protect the greatest number of at risk people in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations, and in protecting the health service.Read MoreFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases

appointments remained available in five out of six vaccination centres this week.The Department of Health described the concerns over empty slots as a misunderstanding and that any vacant appointments

teams.Domiciliary care workers in the independent sector can now also attend the vaccination centres to receive the jab.And a phased programme will see dental, pharmacy and optometry teams given access to the booking system shortly.The department said vaccination appointment slots were only released at short notice to manage the inclusion of dferent staff and vaccine supply, and can be filled quickly.The department added that flexibility is essential for slots to avoid wasting any of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, which comes in large batches.Alongside this, GPs will be administering the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine to their patients.Some GPs have already received their first supplies, with those who are over the age of  first in line.Siobhan McDermott , from Londonderry, questioned

Political cowardice meant that the Executive went ahead and lted restrictions in the full knowledge that a very heavy price would be paid.Official statistics show that those crowds of shoppers, packed restaurants, and large family gatherings came at a very cruel cost.In mid-December, our health service was already under huge pressure and there were warnings that the third wave of coronavirus could be the most dangerous. We were also told of new strains of the disease.Covid didn#t know it was Christmas. It followed no calendar. Yet Stormont behaved as though it did. When quizzed about the wisdom of lting restrictions for Christmas on Monday, Foster stressed that it was a unanimous Executive decision.The DUP will clearly win no awards for putting public health first during this pandemic, but why did Sinn Fein, Alliance, the SDLP and Ulster Unionists support the plan Some argued that the parties really had no other option as the public weren#t in the mood for a cautious Christmas. The Executive had to let the air out of the balloon, says a Stormont source. Eventhey hadn#t, people would have done what they wanted anyway.He has a point, and it#s not just up here that recklessness ruled. The Irish Government loosened restrictions signicantly in December and now has the world#s highest infection rate.Read MoreFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases riseICU nurse warns of coronavirus pressures on traumatised staff as they take sick leave or quit altogetherBallynahinch woman Mona Carlisle receives Covid- vaccine just weeks before th birthdayThe Executive handled the first four months of the pandemic fairly well.

Newtownards man Tom Cahoon had spent months planning his dream wedding to Megan Kennedy on March , .But then, with just two weeks to go before the big day, Covid- struck.Tomand Megan , who live in London, met on the Match dating website in the summer of  and got engaged in late . The pandemic forced the couple to make the dficult decision to postpone their wedding to October  last year. As the new date drew closer and more coronavirus restrictions came their way, they feared their nuptials would have to be put on hold a second time. Determined to say I do, they decided on a small ceremony at their local church, St Stephen#s in Dulwich, followed by a reception at the Corinthia Hotel in Whitehall with  guests, in line with the guidelines at that point. Two weeks before the big day, new rules meant the guest list had to be cut again to . It was all so incredibly stressful as we were so disappointed when we couldn#t get married in March. With the rules changing so quickly we really didn#t believe the wedding was going to happen until the actual day, Megan told the Belfast . We couldn#t even let ourselves get excited until the very last minute as we knew there was always a risk it would all get cancelled again. In order to accommodate close family only in their , Megan#s original bridal party of , including seven bridesmaids, had to be rearranged. Instead, she turned to the strongest and bravest women she knows - her two grans, Mary Kennedyand Gillian Holloway , who gladly stepped in. I#m very close to my two grandmothers. They were always going to be my VIP guests on the day so that was a big factor in our decision to go ahead in October just to make sure they could be there with us, she added.

They thought it was ridiculous at first and that we should give their places to others, as our numbers were so limited, she said. When I explained how important it was to me to have them there by my side on the most important day of my le, they both agreed and then got so excited. Tom said: I thought it was a great idea, and what Megan should have done from the very beginning, as I felt her bridal party of  seemed a bit excessive!The couple are hoping to have a bigger wedding celebration this September, using as many of their original plans as possible.Two of the original bridesmaids, Megan#s sister and her cousin, were able to be in the church last October, and happily stood aside in favour of Mary and Gillian, while some others turned up outside afterwards as a surprise. They were totally understanding about the fact that we had to make some cutthroat decisions, Megan added. They thought it was a really nice idea to ask my grandmothers instead. All being well they#ll still get to step into the roles and wear their bridesmaid dresses as planned this September. Tom explained that many of his family and friends had also been due to fly over to join the celebrations. In the end it was just my parents Jill and Ernie, who travelled over from Ards along with my brother John from Belfast, while my sister Naomi came from Dublin. My other two sisters, Sarah and Hannah, live in London, but my brother Nathan, who is in Edinburgh, missed the wedding as he developed Covid symptoms and had to self-isolate, he said. Thankfully, he tested negative in the end, but my best friend had to step in and act as best man instead.Hopefully, Nathan will be able to make it in September along with a lot of my dad#s side of the family from Cookstown.Megan added: There#s still a lot of uncertainty over whether our venue and vendors will all still be in business by then, butthe reception goes ahead without any restrictions it#ll be a very much-needed reunion and party for everyone after all this time.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusFoster defends festive easing of restrictions after Covid- cases riseFirst Minister Arlene Foster has defended the Executive#s decision to relax restrictions over Christmas after hospitals struggled under intense pressure over the weekend.Coronavirus PremiumICU nurse warns of coronavirus pressures on traumatised staff as they take sick leave or quit altogetherAn ICU nurse has described in harrowing detail the devastating pressures being experienced by staff caring for some of the sickest people here.VideoCoronavirus PremiumBallynahinch woman Mona Carlisle receives Covid- vaccine just weeks before th birthdayIt#s the birthday present of the century - a precious Covid- vaccine for Mona Carlisle.Most ReadMystery as thousands of vaccine slots for Northern Ireland healthcare staff unfilled while over-s waiting for lesaving Covid- jabMan charged with assault after tussle with police in supermarket over face maskRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitBelfast lorry driver struck by rock #may have suffered le-changing injuries#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases as healthcare system under extreme pressureLatest Northern IrelandTrevor RinglandOpinionCelebrating such a unying force is crucial to our futureSporting museum dream #should not be allowed to wither away#NI hauliers hit by huge costs to bring their empty lorries homeBusinesses are being crippled by UK-EU trading regime: PaisleySuzanne BreenOpinionStormont knew we would pay price for a Merry ChristmasLatest from Belfast Tyrone joinery firm Woodmarque in £m investment tipped to bring  jobs by Mac-Group in £m loss after issues with one project in BritainMarks  Spencer snaps up upmarket brand JaegerSFA chief questions Celtic#s ill-fated trip to DubaiArmstrong gets behind youth football tournament,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But the facts on the ground suggest a third option, a kind of middle way, one that reflects the reality of lives as lived on the island rather than any abstract ideals or history: interdependence.There is no evidence that we are close to the necessary conditions for a border poll. Data shows that the majority in Northern Ireland wish to remain in the UK and that the desire for Irish unication has grown, but not signicantly, since .The University of Liverpool Northern Ireland General Election Survey, conducted in January , found that when asked what the most important issue was for respondents, a mere % stated constitutional issues, compared to over % choosing education, health, jobs and the economy.These are the very people who were dragged through a barbaric conflict and who listen daily to commentators and politicians arguing about constitutional and legacy issues, but never about jobs and investment. The reality of these people#s lives is increasing inter-community connection and augmented mutual dependence across the island of Ireland. But commentators and politicians rarely choose to speak to this reality, trapped as they are in the binary framework of the constitutional question.These debates in Northern Ireland do not draw from the well of data and fact. Nationalists typically present the  counties as Nirvana and the Wee Six as a hapless place due to its links with perfidious Albion. Unionists respond that % of southerners live in poverty, that rural Ireland has been abandoned, and like to remind us that two thirds of the southern population do not have access to free healthcare.One side guffaws about Brexit as an opportunity to drive the end of partition, even as businesspeople worry about their future and others their jobs similarly, political unionism exercises a veto over language and equality rights in which the harm caused is not worth the points scored. Within political unionism we find a limited space that promotes and persuades for the Union. And yet, across the aisle, there is no serious blueprint setting out what a united Ireland would be.There is an alternative approach. The Whitaker Report in  ditched economic nationalism, brought women into the labour market, led slowly to the erosion of the church-state relationship and drove the reform of Irish law and society that created the capacity to have a private le. Yet there is no memorial, parade, or banners commemorating the report. The policies and structures that truly produce seismic societal affects typically go neglected.The structures of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Protocol and the new Shared Island unit of the Department of the Taoiseach are the points through which to build and sustain an interdependence that will not be bogged down by wearied conjecture and sectarian head-counting.The Protocol entails a policy of enhanced all-island relationships which will build economic, cultural and political opportunity. The Protocol and its promotion of greater North-South cooperation, combined with Northern Ireland being within the EU customs code and UK customs territory, can frame critical all-island connectivity.Northern Ireland#s unique trading arrangements will build the next generation of all-island economic activity. The work of the first post-conflict generation led to Belfast becoming the fth-best mid-sized European city of the future, according to the annual ranking produced by the consultancy firm fDi. In the economic potential ranking, Belfast was ranked third, behind only Zurich and Edinburgh. Of course, investors know this and are building interdependence into emerging relationships, while certain commentators continue to present the place as a mere backwater.The binary approach to this issue also relies on and propagates the skewed idea that there are two economies on the island, as defined by the border. In fact there are several - amongst them Dublin, Belfast, the South-West, and the left behind.There is an immediate case for building an Atlantic Corridor linking Derry and Limerick. The furthering of linkages between North and South through culture, environment and tourism can also raise the levels of mutual dependence and assist in the avoidance of conflict.For those who are pro-union, greater North-South connection can render the border so invisible that the desire for unication will abate. For those who are pro-unity, greater interdependence can re-establish connections cast asunder by partition. Interdependence is the antidote to the politics of immiserating dissonance that have crippled Northern Ireland for so long.Professor Peter Shirlow is the Director at the University of Liverpool#s Institute of Irish Studies and a founding member of the www.arinsprojectBelfast Related ContentUKSinn Fein and the DUP #need to find a new way# as government #creates chaos from crisis and conflict from challenge#The record of the Executive after the restoration of the Assembly a year ago today has been one of a government that creates chaos from crisis and conflict from challenge, the SDLP leader has said.CommentBrendan O#LearyOpinionReferendum on Irish unity is coming down the tracks faster than most expectedWhoever favours keeping Northern Ireland in Union with Great Britain, or prefers a united Ireland, needs to prepare for a referendum in the North on that exact choice, followed by a matching referendum in the South -there is an affirmative vote for unity in the North.Most ReadMystery as thousands of vaccine slots for Northern Ireland healthcare staff unfilled while over-s waiting for lesaving Covid- jabMan charged with assault after tussle with police in supermarket over face maskRaided for listening to Radio   Belfast hairdresser Shankey stunned by PSNI Covid visitBelfast lorry driver struck by rock #may have suffered le-changing injuries#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and  new cases as healthcare system under extreme pressureLatest Northern IrelandTrevor RinglandOpinionCelebrating such a unying force is crucial to our futureSporting museum dream #should not be allowed to wither away#NI hauliers hit by huge costs to bring their empty lorries homeBusinesses are being crippled by UK-EU trading regime: PaisleySuzanne BreenOpinionStormont knew we would pay price for a Merry ChristmasLatest from Belfast Mac-Group in £m loss after issues with one project in BritainMS snaps up upmarket brand JaegerSFA chief questions Celtic#s ill-fated trip to DubaiArmstrong gets behind youth football tournamentTrevor RinglandOpinionCelebrating such a unying force is crucial to our future,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Retailers like John Lewis, AO, Madee and Dunelm have all said they have put their deliveries on hold.One reader also reported a problem with deliveries from online homewares retailer Wayfair but it has not replied to a request for comment. But TK Maxx, which last week cancelled orders from customers here, said orders from here and delivery here had been restored. In an interview with the Belfasttoday, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said there was no reason for companies shipping from Great Britain to put orders from customers here on hold.Read MoreBrandon Lewis: Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is backBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea border He said he would contact Peloton as there#s no reason for them in terms of parcels deliveries to have any issue. Companies sending goods to Northern Ireland are required to complete new customs paperwork under the NI Protocol, which came into force as the transition period came to an end last week.While guidance from HMRC published on New Year#s Eve introduced a three-month grace period for parcels being sent to consumers, many companies had already decided to put Northern Ireland deliveries on hold before that point. A Belfastreader said they had tried to order a Peloton bike to be told by a worldwide company they cannot fulfil orders to Northern Ireland due to the Brexit situation.I tried to explain we are part of the UK but with no luck, they added.The hi-tech exercise bike, which costs around £, for the original model, has become a sought-after item for exercise at home - tapping into the surge in popularity of cycling and the closure of gyms during lockdown.The company, which was founded in the US, enables users to tune into intense spin classes or other forms of exercise online using a touchscreen integrated into the equipment.A spokeswoman for Peloton said: We have temporarily paused new sales of the Peloton Bike and Peloton Bike+ whilst we update our systems and processes in response to Brexit. Customers who placed an order on or before December ,  will still have their Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+ delivered. We are working to resume full service and sales in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.She added: Our existing members in Northern Ireland are not affected by this pause to new sales and still have full access to our service, as well as the ability to arrange a service appointment or a refund for their Peloton Bike or Bike+. A spokeswoman for white goods and electricals retailer AO confirmed that its deliveries here were on hold.They added: Like some other online retailers, changes to customs arrangements for deliveries to Northern Ireland mean it will take a few weeks for us and our delivery partner to make the necessary adjustments.

From mid-December  to early January , like the rest of the country, Derry experienced its coldest winter on record when temperatures stayed below  degrees centigrade for days on end. It was the third coldest winter in succession that brought heavy snowfalls, record low temperatures, travel chaos and school closures. The River Foyle, the fastest-flowing river in Europe for its size, froze over , City of Derry Airport was forced to close, sporting fixtures postponed and many Christmas parties and festive nights out with family and friends were cancelled. googletag.cmd.push  Speaking at the time, John Wylie, from the Met Office, said: Sub-zero tem- peratures, widespread deep snow and all of the correct factors coming together at the right time to give us this weather event which will probably go down in history. A temperature of -. degC was recorded in Ballykelly on December , . On the same day, Castlederg in County Tyrone was put firmly on the map - not only did it set a new record Northern Ireland lowest temperature, but it was also the coldest spot on the entire island as the thermometer fell to -.C. The Arctic weather conditions first struck in  . googletag.cmd.push This was followed by the winter of   which for much of the country was worst since  , bringing widespread and heavy snowfalls. Despite the entire country being covered in a blanket of snow,  was not regarded as a White Christmas as no snow fell on Christmas Day.  The scene in Brooke Park in   in a photo taken by Ashlene Joyce. However, just like today, Derry showed its kind nature as a number of community groups took the initiative in ensuring that vulnerable people were looked after during the wintery weather. Volunteers in a number of areas visited elderly people in their homes distributing food and winter clothing and helping with shopping.     Members of the Leafair Community Association  handed out Winter Health Packs to local residents. The packs – distributed in partnership with the Neighbourhood Health Improvement Project– included a thermal blanket, gloves and socks, five energy efficient light bulbs and a thermometer. Peter McDonald, co-ordinator with the LCA, said the scheme proved to be a vital measure in keeping those most at risk from the elements safe. Community volunteers in the Triaxtook part in ‘Operation Snowball,’ aimed at helping the elderly community get through the cold snap, helping old people get to the shops as well as Mass as well as salting salt and clearing the footpaths in Creggan Street, Oakfield and several of the steep streets off the Lone Moor Road. Volunteers also cleared pavements in the Top of the Hill and Shantallow areas. The severe cold spell in the run up to Christmas was estimated to have cost the British economy up to pound. billion a day, with a total cost of pound billion. Retailers were particularly badly hit by lost sales with footfall down nearly % compared to the same period the previous year. Comments by the chief executive of a major hospitality body in the North echoed those of today. Colin Neill, of Pubs of Ulster, which at the time represented % pf pubs in the North, described the situation for the local industry as critical after trade was badly hit by the harsh weather. Hundreds of s had to be cancelled after snow caused massive disruption. Mr Neill said: “This is probably the worst trading period over Christmas on record for our industry. We normally do % of our years turnover in December and we have people cancelling left, right and centre.” After the freeze came the thaw and within days tens of thousands of people were struggling to cope without water because of burst pipes. About  towns and villages across Northern Ireland were affected and many people had to queue every day to get water for drinking and washing. About , homes and businesses were cut off from the mains water supply during the Christmas period and NI Water was severely criticised for its response to those in need.    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Although only detailed family history research will confirm the actual Irish origins of your ancestors, surname histories can provide clues and insight into family origins. The  Foyle Community Directory lists , unique surnames in Derry city. Each of these surnames bears a distinctive history and taken as a whole they are a record of population movements into the Derry area over the past  years. Derry’s dynamic history can be seen in the richness and iety of her surnames. googletag.cmd.push The three commonest names have Donegal origins with Doherty heading the way with  entries, followed by McLaughlin on  and Gallagher with  entries. By way of contrast,  surnames occur only once.  Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan and sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either ‘Mac’or ‘O’to the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a ‘sept’. A sept can be identied as ‘a group of persons who, or whose immediate and known ancestors, bore a common surname and inhabited the same locality’. As a consequence, Gaelic-Irish surnames are still very dominant and numerous in the very districts where their names originated. By tradition, many of the prominent surnames of Gaelic origin in Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone today trace their descent from either Eoghan or Conal Gulban, two of the sons of Niall of the Nine Hostages, King of Tara who was slain in  AD.     Those tracing descent from Eoghan include: Brolly, Carlin, Devlin, Donnelly, Duddy, Duffy, Farren, Gormley, Hegarty, McCloskey, McLaughlin, Mellon, Mullen, O’Hagan, O’Kane, O’Neill, Quinn and Toner. From Conall Gulban: Doherty, Friel, Gallagher, McCafferty, McDaid, McDevitt and O’Donnell. By tradition, Eoghan and Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland about  AD, and in the process captured the great hill-top fortication of Grianaacuten of Aileach in Inishowen, County Donegal which overlooks the city of Derry and the surrounding countryside. Although Gaelic society was one of the first to adopt a system of hereditary surnames it was also one of the last to perpetuate fixed surnames. People in these societies, in the early th century, were often designated by their genealogies stretching back five or more generations. For example, Shane O’Neill of Shane’s Castle, County Antrim, styled himself on the family vault, which he built in , as ‘Shane McBrien McPhelim McShane McBrien McPhelim O’Neill Esq’. Here is family history in one name stretching back over  years. The last-named Phelim was Felim ‘The Lame’ who was Prince of Clanaboy from  to . The Genealogical Office manuscript collections in Office of the Chief Herald at National Library of Ireland, Dublin are the most important source for the genealogies of Gaelic families and of those families entitled to bear arms either by hereditary right or by grant. On th July , Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen, County Donegal. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, known today as ‘St Columb’s Stone’, inside the walled garden in the grounds of the former Belmont House School, Racecourse Road, Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: the claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood. By tradition, the crowning stone, blessed by Saint Columba, was carried to Belmont from Grianan of Aileach. By tradition, Grianan is identied as being the great “royal fort” of Aileach, the citadel of the northern Ui Neill from the th to the th century. With the Genealogical Office manuscript collections a family chart can be constructed which, on the male line, records the ancestors of Ramon O’Dogherty, “Chief of the Name”, back through  generations to Niall of the Nine Hostages, th century High King of Ireland Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sean, brother of Sir Cahir O’Doherty , who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The founder of the Spanish branch of the O’Doghertys was John who, on the death of his father Eoghan in , came out with his brothers Henry and Clinton Dillon to pursue a career in the Spanish Navy, the most exclusive branch of the Spanish armed forces. Entry required them to show their genealogy, proving noble origin. In  the King of Arms in Dublin Castle confirmed the three brothers as being “descended in a direct line from Shane or Sir John O’Dogherty, Chief of Innish-Owen”. In the th century substantial numbers of English and Scottish families settled in the northern part of Ireland during the so-called Plantation of Ulster. These settlers came to Ulster, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and, finally, in the fteen years after  and the Glorious Revolution. Famine in Scotlandfrom -, together with landlords in Ulster actively seeking new tenants, resulted in a massive influx of Scottish settlers to Ulster in the s. Substantial numbers of Scottish families entered Ulster through Derry and settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of Counties Donegal, Londonderry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in Ayrshire the Clyde Valley Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries in Galloway and the Border Lands of Berwick, Peebles, Selkirk and Roxburgh were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Hence surnames such as Anderson, Arbuckle, Armstrong, Barr, Beattie, Bell, Buchanan, Burns, Campbell, Carruthers, Colhoun, Craig, Cunningham, Dunlop, Elliott, Ferguson, Finlay, Fleming, Frazer, Gillespie, Graham, Grant, Hamilton, Hanna, Haslett, Henderson, Holmes, Houston, Irvine, Irwin, Johnston, Kennedy, Kilgore, Lindsay, McAllister, McCartney, McClean, McClelland, McClintock, McCorkell, McCormick, McDonald, Miller, Mitchell, Montgomery, Moore, Olphert, Orr, Parkhill, Patterson, Patton, Rankin, Robb, Rosborough, Ross, Scott, Starrett, Stewart, Thompson, Wallace, Wilson and Young have been established in northwest Ireland for well over three centuries. More recent arrivals from outside the British Isles have also contributed a small but interesting collection of surnames in the Derry area. An Italian community with surnames such as Battisti, Caffola, Cassoni, Centra, Corrieri, Del Pinto, Fiorentini, Forte, Macari, Vaccaro and Yannarelli settled in Derry in the s. A Jewish community with names such as Schenkel, Szilagyi, Spain and Watchman settled in Derry and worshipped in a synagogue in Kennedy Place, and a thriving Indian Community, represented by surnames such as Chada, Singh, Vig and Vij, has been established in the city since the s, most of whom originate from the Punjab in northern India. The family histories associated with surname histories in Derry will, in many instances, be recorded in the database of Derry Genealogy at www.derry.rootsireland.ie.  The database of Derry Genealogy contains the bulk of pre- civil birth and marriage registers for the city and county of Derry, the early baptismal and marriage registers of  churches , gravestone inscriptions from  graveyards, and census substitutes and census s dating from  to .

Within days, the pressure that the system was under was evident through the images shown across media outlets of multiple ambulances queuing outside Emergency Departments. We also highlighted that there was a very real risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed in the event of a further COVID- spike in January. googletag.cmd.push “Although dferent parts of the country are in dferent stages of the third COVID- surge, and inidual hospitals are reflecting this, the situation is very serious with modelling projections indicating that in the third week in January we will be trying to contend with double the number of COVID positive patients compared to the current position today, when several hospitals already have record numbers of patients. “This is not a simple matter of putting up more beds. We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren’t there. googletag.cmd.push “Already several Trusts are having to stand down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery, to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both COVID and non-COVID patients needing ICU care. “These postponed operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. We have established a regional approach to ensure that any available theatre capacity across Northern Ireland is allocated for those patients most in need of surgery, both during surge and as we come out of this surge. “This may mean that patients will need to travel further for their surgery. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options.     “We know that we speak for all health and social care staff in assuring the public that we will do everything that we possibly can to deal with the situation that is unfolding. Our staff, although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it. “It will definitely not be easy and the care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best. Desperately ill patients whether COVID or non-COVID will always be the ones being prioritised. “No-one should be attending an Emergency Department at any time unless they need emergency care. It is likely that those who do attend will wait longer to be seen and for admission to hospitalthat is what they require. “Patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to le threatening emergencies in the community. “Patients also need to leave hospital as soon as they are medically fit to leave.

Within days, the pressure that the system was under was evident through the images shown across media outlets of multiple ambulances queuing outside Emergency Departments. We also highlighted that there was a very real risk that hospitals could be overwhelmed in the event of a further COVID- spike in January. googletag.cmd.push “Although dferent parts of the country are in dferent stages of the third COVID- surge, and inidual hospitals are reflecting this, the situation is very serious with modelling projections indicating that in the third week in January we will be trying to contend with double the number of COVID positive patients compared to the current position today, when several hospitals already have record numbers of patients. “This is not a simple matter of putting up more beds. We need the staff to care for the increased number of patients. Pre-existing staffing pressures and staff absence because of COVID, and other reasons, mean that those staff simply aren’t there. googletag.cmd.push “Already several Trusts are having to stand down all but the most urgent elective surgery, including some red-flag cancer surgery, to redeploy staff to meet the urgent and immediate needs of extremely ill patients, especially both COVID and non-COVID patients needing ICU care. “These postponed operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. We have established a regional approach to ensure that any available theatre capacity across Northern Ireland is allocated for those patients most in need of surgery, both during surge and as we come out of this surge. “This may mean that patients will need to travel further for their surgery. Cancer services are seeking to maintain chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other non-surgical treatments and alternative treatments will be provided in the absence of surgical options.     “We know that we speak for all health and social care staff in assuring the public that we will do everything that we possibly can to deal with the situation that is unfolding. Our staff, although exhausted, will once more go above and beyond to do the best they can for as many people as possible, and we thank them for it. “It will definitely not be easy and the care that we are able to provide will at times fall short of the high standards we normally deliver but we will do our very best. Desperately ill patients whether COVID or non-COVID will always be the ones being prioritised. “No-one should be attending an Emergency Department at any time unless they need emergency care. It is likely that those who do attend will wait longer to be seen and for admission to hospitalthat is what they require. “Patients arriving by ambulance will also wait at times, sometimes for many hours before space is available in an already over-stretched ED. This has a direct impact on the ability of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service to respond, in a timely manner, to le threatening emergencies in the community. “Patients also need to leave hospital as soon as they are medically fit to leave. We will work tirelessly to ensure that this happens. That might mean accepting a placement where it is available and it might also mean families having to go the extra mile to provide temporary support for relatives. But we will need every bed that we have for those that are most in need. “Pressure in one part of the health and social care system inevitably impacts on the other parts. For example, we might once again need families to be willing to fill unavoidable gaps in domiciliary care. “Never has the phrase ‘all in it together’ been so pertinent and just so important. The COVID- vaccines provide the long-term hope and the current lockdown offers the opportunity to shorten the duration of the current surge. The public can play their part too by staying at home, practising social distancing and good hand hygiene and wearing face coverings. “We thank you in advance for your assistance.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the long term, the group hope to restore and improve access to the castle. Inch Castle is situated at the extreme seaward end of Inch Island. googletag.cmd.push It was built in the middle of the fteenth century but, by , when granted to Sir Arthur Chichester, he stated that it was in a state of disrepair. When the castle was built, Inch was an island and was considered secure. It guarded the waters of the Swilly and protected the heartlands of the O’Dohertys. However, the O’Dohertys resided at the castle of Elagh, near Derry instead, until . The land between the Swilly and the Foyle was rich in cattle and corn, but it was vulnerable to attack from both land and sea, thus explaining the number of castles built in the region. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Inch Castle was built as part of a network of O’Doherty castles designed to ward off anyone who threatened their lordship.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I would implore that everyone plays their part, stays at home, follow the guidelines and take the vaccine.ldquoWe are absolutely slaughtered in hospitals and those big numbers of new cases will feed into admissions and we are already at capacity.ldquoA fortnight from now, a proportion of the new cases will end up in hospital and hospitals have not yet had the chance to get out of surge two and we are straight into surge three.The local councillor spoke of her personal relief at being vaccinated.ldquoAt the moment Irsquove only got the first jab which I will get the second in about  weeks time. But % or so protection is better than none.ldquoI view it as a great blessing and we have to be very grateful to our scientists who have worked around the clock to get us where we are today.The DUP councillor said she experienced no issues from having the vaccine.She confirmed that her vaccination team are doing around  vaccinations a day and that hospital staff will be rolling out the Pfizer vaccine while Gps will be responsible for administering the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.ldquoWe have our doctors and nurses taking the vaccine and these are healthcare professionals who understand the rigorous testing that all new drugs go through, said Cllr Owen. ldquoThey are putting their money where their mouth is and at the end of the day so am I.ldquoIrsquom happy to stand over this to encourage others in the uptake. Itrsquos our way out of this nightmare that we are all in.Her one regret is that her husband and children are not been yet vaccinated from the virus.She added: ldquoThey will have to wait their turn but I am the one in the family whorsquos probably at the highest risk as I work on wards and could be bringing it home.

We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas. We can see how much Dublin for example have benefited from utilising their urban areas, and the rewards they have reaped from that in recent years on the pitch, as well as financially.He did caution that, as ever, the availability of funding is major issue.ldquoThe GAA took a huge hit financially in  - that is likely to happen to some degree at least, again this year.ldquoIn terms of us here in Down though, we are in a stronger position to deal with the climate I would like to think, certainly when compared to other northern counties.ldquoWe have big urban centres which is vitally important. We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds.

We have in essence been in a lockdown-type situation for a long time.Even so, Craig said Newcastle League officials are not yet throwing in the towel in trying to devise a way for a season to be played.ldquoAny decision we make with regards to how and when we can get football back up and running again will be taken in conjunction with our clubs.ldquoWe need their input on how they feel about the situation, and there needs to be a want from the clubs to get back to playing as well. All of those things will be up for discussion within the league committee when we know where we stand.Amateur League chairman Terry Pateman says he has not yet given up hope of getting some sort of season put together over the next few months.ldquoWe are still essentially working blind, he said. ldquoWe are trying to devise ways of starting the new season before we know what the government are going to decide next, he said.ldquoIf there were no further stoppages beyond the dates already in place for us, we could proceed with what would obviously be a shortened season.

While the appreciation of these workers may have changed in the eyes of some their pay and conditions have not.The crisis has further illustrated the incredible work undertaken by our nurses and doctors, in addition to the work undertaken by public transport workers, cleaners and those in our emergency services.Long periods of having to work from home for others have also served to highlight that homes are our sanctuary. The lack of affordable, decent homes must be addressed in the time ahead mdash especially in areas like South Down where many young people can not chose to stay and live in their local community.So there is no doubt that challenges remain for us as we enter this new year, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.

This has served our people well.The voice of Ireland, and the concerns of the North, have been heard and heeded.And while a deal has now been agreed between the EU and British Government, our priority remains on ensuring unique protections for Ireland and the full implementation of the Protocol.Brexit has opened up a public discourse on the future of this island and exposed the undemocratic nature of partition.In , we will look back at a seminal chapter in our history mdash the partition of our island. For nationalists and republicans, the centenary of partition will not be a cause for celebration.It does, however, give us cause to look to the possibilities and opportunities for the future of the people of this island.This is a defining moment in our history and people will have decisions to make on what is in the best interests of our island.We are in a decade of opportunity where the right to decide our own future rests in the hands of our people. The conversation on Irish unity is well underway across our society.The provision for a referendum on unity is part of the Good Friday Agreement.We now have a choice between a narrow, inward-looking vision of Brexit Britain or the open inclusive vision of a New Ireland. should be about an inclusive conversation. This is a time for debate and big, bold ideas for everyone who calls this island home.Let us all begin this new year with a sense of realism about the challenges we continue to face but also optimism and a commitment to help us build a new and better future for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Workers.jpg","title":"Workers set for strike  ","story":"TALKS between Newry, Mourne and Down Council and trade unions have failed to stop industrial action which started on Monday.The industrial action, including a work-to-rule by all trade union members, is already having an impact with residents claiming overflowing bins have not being emptied.A second day of strike action has been called for end of the month.

For example, under the new law, young people would be permitted to remain on licensed premises beyond pm, to allow them to attend a private , such as a wedding or anniversary party, provided certain conditions are met, for example a main meal is served and a parent oris with them. In another proposal, part of a licensed premises may be deemed suitable to hold an underagesuch as a school formal.Of course, while some of these relaxations will be considered a common sense approach, with a number of recent studies highlighting an increase in underage drinking, we are also keen to ensure that the new law includes measures to protect our children and young people in places where alcohol is served. Changing laws is always a balancing act and we want to ensure that as well as supporting our hospitality and tourism industries, particularly important post Covid, this bill will also allow us to bring forward measures to help tackle alcohol misuse and to promote responsible consumption. The bill sets out a number of proposals to address these issues, for example, by restricting the advertising of alcohol in supermarkets and licensed premises, as well as prohibiting retailers from allowing customers to gain or use loyalty points from alcohol purchases. Law making is never an easy process but I firmly believe that good laws are made when the people they affect are given the opportunity to get involved and have their say. Our ‘Call for Views’ is available on the assembly’s website at http:nia.me  and will remain open until next Monday .We are asking local people to tell us about their experiences and ideas, and,they think the proposals in the bill go too far, or not far enough. Respondents do not have to complete all sections of the online form and can concentrate on the areas that are most relevant or important to them. Responses can be kept anonymousrequested and will help us as a committee to ensure that when this Bill is eventually passed, it will be robust and fit for purpose for many years to come. • Paula Bradley is a DUP MLA  chair of Stormont’s Committee for Communities——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

In these woods live Barbastelle and Bechsteinrsquos bat, and rare birds like lesser redpoll, lesser spotted woodpecker and woodcock.The Vale council is currently consulting the public on the proposals. The consultation runs until December , after which the council will consider what to do next mdash potentially drawing up a full business case for the new road.Coed Cadw is encouraging people to register their concerns about the loss of ancient woodland on their website, with six days left to register objections.A spokesman for the Vale of Glamorgan council said: ldquoNo decisions have been made on this matter, which is currently the subject of public consultation.Natalie ButtrissldquoEarly in the new year, a consultation report will be presented to cabinet and a decision taken on next steps. We encourage as many people as possible to respond to the consultation.The plans can be read in full on the Vale councilrsquos website, where people can also respond to the online consultation.Interested iniduals are urged to visit theCoed Cadw websiteto register their concerns.For more information, visit:https:www.woodlandtrust.org.uk protecting-trees-and-woods campaign-with-us m-link-road Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This means it will have few storage and transportation issues, making it much easier to use in community settings such as care homes and primary care settings like GP surgeries.Wales health minister Vaughan Gething said: ldquoWe understand there are high expectations and excitement at the arrival of a second vaccine. However it will take time to reach everyone as this is not an instant fix. We wonrsquot receive all the doses at once and we have to be realistic about the scale and pace of delivery when we are vaccinating the entire adult population.ldquoWe will not see the impact of the vaccine for some months and the pressure on the NHS will continue during this winter.

To help the NHS to help you please wait to be invited for your vaccination.Senior responsible officer for Walesrsquo Covid- vaccine programme Dr Gillian Richardson said: ldquoThe vaccine has been approved as safe and effective by the MHRA, based on the same high standards as applied to all medicines and vaccines.ldquoIt is great news that a second vaccine has met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the MHRA.Dr Nicola Williams, director of support and delivery at Health and Care Research Wales, which is nationally co-ordinating research and study-set up in Wales, said: ldquoOur research community is working hard to provide the evidence we need to fight this pandemic and the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is an important step forward. We have two further vaccines being tested in Wales right now, with more trials due to be set up in the coming weeks and months.ldquoThis research, alongside the other Covid- studies taking place will help us to not only protect the most vulnerable but also to provide the best care possible for those who become ill.ldquoIrsquom proud of the role our researchers in Wales have played in this UK-wide effort and I would like to thank the participants too who have volunteered.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
