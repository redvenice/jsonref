The Sea For Yourself campaign wants them to take pride of place on your plateFish and chips with a side order of mushy peas has been a Friday night tradition for generations. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded fish and chip shop in London in 1860 and dedicated takeaways have been serving customers ever since.Yet despite this heritage, if you choose battered cod, plaice or haddock to soak up your vinegar, it’s unlikely to have been fished from UK waters: the majority of the cod and haddock we buy is imported from the Barents Sea or around Norway or Iceland.According to the Sea For Yourself campaign, which is largely funded by Defra and aims to inspire the UK to eat seafood caught in UK waters, close to half of adults would buy more seafood if they knew it was caught locally. The good news is that if you’re keen to eat more seafood that’s been caught closer to home, there’s a wealth of alternatives to choose from.We know fish is good for us and the catches found in our waters, from mussels, oysters and crab, to oil-rich mackerel and flaky lemon sole, are a great source of protein, vitamins and minerals. The NHS recommends that we should all enjoy at least two portions of fish a week, one of which should be an oil-rich variety.“Most of us are familiar with nutrition advice that encourages us to eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables for optimal health, and it’s the same when it comes to seafood,” says Juliette Kellow, consultant nutritionist at Seafish, a non-departmental public body set up to support the UK seafood industry and funded mainly by a levy on all first-hand purchases of seafood products in the UK, including imported seafood. “Many varieties of fish provide a range of B vitamins, which help fight fatigue for those of us always on the go.“Incorporating fish such as herring, coley or hake, and shellfish like crab and mussels into your diet is smart, as they provide a great source of protein and allow you to make the most of all the health benefits seafood offers.” When you’re trying to get more variety into your diet, it makes sense to try something new.Trying a wide variety of fish dishes instead of sticking to well-worn favourites supports UK fishermen, helps stocks stay sustainable and keeps your mealtimes creative – because of course, the real beauty of seafood is its endless versatility.Four in 10 of us claim we’d be more likely to cook seafood at home if we felt more confident using it in the kitchen, and whipping up a Friday night fish supper – whether you’re angling for a pile of battered monkfish bites, a plate of simply dressed devilled herrings or a steaming bowl of moules marinière – is a lot easier than you might think.If a fish and chip supper is non-negotiable on a Friday night, beer-battered dover sole is a delicious alternative to cod, while shellfish is a great choice if you’re bored with chicken and looking for an alternative source of low-fat protein.In warmer weather, go for fresh hake with seasonal asparagus and Jersey Royals, or a poached hake salade niçoise. For something a bit different, crab thermidor is surprisingly quick to make, while fish tacos made with coley goujons make the ideal bite for sharing in front of the TV. Fresh oysters on ice or spiced coconut mussels are perfect for impressing. When the weather cools down, there’s a wealth of winter warmers to choose, from roast hake with curried stew to smoked mackerel risotto.Plenty of seafood dishes are surprisingly quick to pull together. Monkfish and coconut curry takes about 15 minutes to prepare, while an Asian-spiced crab and noodle salad with black sesame seed dressing can be on the table in 10 minutes flat. Children love fish too, which is always a bonus when faced with picky eaters – coley goujons instead of fish fingers, or mackerel fishcakes made with mash are easy weekday crowd-pleasers.We all have a favourite fish, and when you’re seafood savvy it’s not hard to find an often-overlooked alternative to your usual choice – from soft, flaky flounder to firm, boldly flavoured sprats or rainbow trout.With so much choice, you may struggle to decide what to cook, but to make things a bit easier, Seafish has created a website so you can arrange for the best of UK seafood to be delivered to your door.

For this project she returned to her grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg to explore themes of memory, isolation and female identity across three generations of her familyThe images in this series address questions of claustrophobic spaces. They convey a sense of being locked down, however they were taken last year before the emergence of Covid-19. They were snapped inside my grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg, which for many years she has hardly left. As long as I can remember my grandmother’s world has conveyed a sense of being locked down. She leaves the flat once a week to get groceries and a TV guide from the shop directly below her apartment. In the winter she doesn’t leave the flat for three months because it’s too cold and windy outside, or too slippery.To keep entertained, Babushka cooks, washes dishes, mends clothes and watches TV. Under Russia’s coroanvirus lockdown measures she isn’t allowed to travel more than 200 metres from her apartment. This is something she has hardly done in the past 10 years, so her life is relatively unchanged.With the intention of exploring my Russian connections, I made two trips to the country in September and December 2019. In this small apartment I made portraits of my grandmother (Babushka), my mother (Svetlana) and myself, in various configurations. I also documented the daily routines and minutiae of my grandmother’s life – the furnishings, her food and pickles, her decor and the ubiquitous television screen that is her main connection to the outside world.The reality I’m depicting here for my grandmother has not changed much she has always lived in this way. Since my grandfather died 10 years ago, her life has become increasingly isolated. My grandmother took care of me for the first four years of my life so, for me, the apartment is like a time capsule. When I visit I am treated like I’m still a child and it doesn’t feel like much changes, though at times I have not returned for years. The routine and familiarity of life in this apartment can be both bleak and comforting and I set myself the challenge of building a visual narrative with photographs taken only within its confines. I saw this work was as the beginning of a long-term process of engagement with my family history and I hadn’t anticipated that a depiction of this claustrophobic isolation would be so pertinent to what’s happening today.My grandmother was born at the start of the second world war, which brought starvation and many other privations. She experienced temporary blindness as a child and has permanent partial deafness as a result of the war. My mother grew up in communist Russia, when travel outside of the Soviet Union was not possible. As a young woman she lived through perestroika and also experienced immense hardship there was no food on the shelves and basic items were rationed. During this time there was also a lot of fear surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.My grandmother sewing in her bedroom, one of the common places you may find her in her flat at midday.The traumas of state violence, war and gender violence weigh heavily on my family. My great grandfather, a victim of Stalin’s purges, was executed in the 1930s. I was born in Russia, but came to Britain at the age of four, after my mother fled my abusive and violent father.With this project I wanted to engage with my family history and investigate my grandmother’s life and the relationships between her, my mother and me. I felt that through exploring this one small confined space I could find something typically Russian but universally human. I am particularly interested in the idea of post-memory, and in understanding the ways family trauma may be passed down through the generations. I am also interested in how we create and project on to our own pasts.My intention is to place female narratives, so often neglected, at the centre of this project. I hope this depiction of the lives of three ordinary women will represent something universal about the bonds of love and history that connect generations of women around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f44919095bb6193b10e2668c7588211ef683b00/0_248_2772_1663/master/2772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed4625af60d36dd363fa925f7014b27","title":"great british art quiz university liverpool victoria gallery museum","story":"The University of Liverpool’s Victoria Gallery and Museum set today’s quiz, in our series exploring the art collections of British museums closed due to Covid-19This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with\u0026nbspArt UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

In the middle of the night Candy collapses, victim of a rare virus, and as Gavanndra watches she dies in their father’s arms: “For a long moment it looked like a sculpture, but Dad was howling, a noise tearing from his stomach, and I wanted to put my hands over my ears and close my eyes but I couldn’t.” The family returns to London, Candy is cremated, and life goes on.Fast forward to 2014, and it turns out that putting her hands over her ears and closing her eyes is exactly what Hodge has managed to do for 25 years. Now in her 40s, she is outwardly the picture of success: a Cambridge graduate, deputy editor of Tatler, happily married with two children. Yet beyond Candy’s death and funeral she has no memories of her. When Hodge sets about writing an account of her childhood she finds herself binge drinking and sliding into depression. Far from moving on from the shock of her sister’s death, she realises, she “adapted to it, like a sapling growing around a metal spike, making it part of who I was”, and at last begins counselling for a lifetime of repressed grief and trauma.The Consequences of Love is a courageous attempt at coming to an accommodation with loss. It’s also an inspired, at times bleakly comic narrative about living in a family so spectacularly dysfunctional that it could have formed the basis of a book in its own right. “I have spent over two decades pretending to be a different person, someone who fits into the world that I find myself a part of,” Hodge admits. The high achiever is a hard-won facade her true backstory isn’t one of glamorous accomplishment but of the “savage self-confidence which comes from desperation”, of “skin-of-the-teeth survival”.\u0026nbspHodge grew up in 1980s and 90s London as the daughter of celebrity hairdresser and “philandering junkie” Gavin Hodge (her exotic first name, which sounds like an invincible warrior queen’s in the Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons games she plays as a teen, is really derived from his). For decades Gavin was dealer by unofficial appointment to a cohort of blue-blooded addicts from Jamie, Marquess of Blandford to Lady Alethea Savile. His wife, Jan, was an alcoholic former model. Hodge recalls making her own breakfast by the time she was three following her parents’ all-night benders, “the room dark, wine bottles and ashtrays all around, my parents still asleep – who knew when they would wake up”.Candy is born when Hodge is four Jan once told her “she and Dad were surprised to find themselves pregnant a second time because they had been so wasted on booze and drugs that they couldn’t remember having had sex”. As a seven-year-old she takes on the job of stubbing out the burning cigarettes of her dad’s clients after they pass out in the small hours on the living room floor when the police rip open her teddy bears during a raid she doesn’t reveal that Gavin’s heroin is stashed in the battery compartment of his torch since he’s warned her. “It’s our little secret.”Hodge relates all this with an extreme candour that highlights both the agony and the absurdity of being raised by a junkie. Part of the challenge involved in her examining of the past lies in having to accept that “fun and funny” Dad himself had no qualms about hurting her. She calls him a sex addict, but his behaviour is far more predatory than the term implies. He grooms her friends by plying them with drugs: “Girls who went to my school. Girls whom I brought down to his hairdressing salon.” Jan finally throws him out after discovering that he has been having sex with one of Gavanndra’s schoolmates from the year below. Is he repentant? Not a bit of it. When weighing Gavin’s casual destructiveness, Hodge veers between revulsion and regret: “My father never said sorry. The drug addiction was a disease the sex drive was a dragon.”\u0026nbspIt is Jan, whose born-again Christianity Hodge finds difficult to tolerate, who emerges as the quiet heroine in this story, providing the day-to-day stability after the orce without which her daughter wouldn’t have managed to get her life back on track. One of the most compelling things in the book is an interview Hodge conducts with Jan about the past: her mother’s honesty, and her memories of Candy, are “a revelation”. Her father, on the other hand, “never required me to be honest, only complicit, which is much more fun”. You wish that she could have brought herself to condemn his manipulations in less equivocal terms. But mostly you want to salute her for escaping the dragon’s den, and for writing about it with such verve.• The Consequences of Love by Gavanndra Hodge is published by Michael Joseph (RRP £14.99).

The deal brought together two businesses that have faced criticism for helping touts charge consumers\u0026nbsphuge mark-ups for attending Ed Sheeran gigs, watching Premier League matches or seeing Michelle Obama\u0026nbspat the O2 in London.Viagogo’s founder and boss, Eric Baker, said in February he believed the virus was isolated to Asia.But the subsequent spread of Covid-19 has meant the takeover, partly funded by the Walton family behind Walmart, has been labelled the “worst deal ever” by Forbes magazine.StubHub, which leads the US market, is thought to be in financial difficulty due to the pandemic and has faced criticism for withholding refunds from fans who have bought tickets for cancelled events, offering them credit instead.If Baker’s purchase of StubHub goes ahead as planned, he will bring two businesses he founded under the same umbrella, creating a ticket resale giant.The entrepreneur co-founded StubHub, before leaving the company amid a dispute with his business partner Jeff Fluhr, who later sold the company to eBay. Baker moved to London, where he set up Viagogo as a European competitor.The two firms are by far the leading players in ticket resale in the UK, prompting the CMA investigation. The regulator has previously threatened Viagogo with legal action for misleading consumers, dropping the action after the firm made changes to its website.Viagogo said: “As we have throughout this process, we will continue to work diligently with the CMA during their review\u0026nbspof the transaction.“We remain committed to our belief that the combination of the two companies is a good move for customers worldwide.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c61f42c53012deb38a1c231723c8235ba6e3eee3/0_159_3955_2373/master/3955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6b154935cd686b1589057ce6d0afbb8","title":"just eat uber grubhub takeover food delivery service","story":"Planned takeover will create world’s largest food delivery service outside ChinaEuropean food delivery service Just Eat Takeaway has agreed to buy the US-based app Grubhub for $7.3bn (£5.8bn) in a deal that would create the world’s largest food delivery service outside China.Confirmation of the all-stock takeover deals a blow to Uber, which has its own food delivery business and was reportedly in discussions with Grubhub.The tie-up will give the Netherlands-based Just Eat Takeaway access to the lucrative food delivery market in the US, with the combined business able to serve customers in 25 countries. Along with the US, these include some of the world’s most profitable food delivery markets – the UK, Netherlands and Belgium.There has been a surge in demand in the food delivery market during the pandemic, as government shutdowns prevented restaurants from serving diners at their premises.The deal comes less than six months after Takeaway won a fierce £6.3bn bidding battle to buy Just Eat, fighting off its rival Prosus, the Amsterdam-listed offshoot of the South African technology group Naspers.Jitse Groen, the chief executive and founder of Just Eat Takeway described himself and the Grubhub boss, Matt Maloney, as “the two remaining food delivery veterans in the sector”, adding that they started their businesses on different continents at the turn of the century.“Both of us have a firm belief that only businesses with high-quality and profitable growth will sustain in our sector,” Groen said.When Grubhub was founded, the online takeaway industry did not exist in the US, Maloney said. “Combining the companies that started it all will mean that two trailblazing start-ups have become a clear global leader. We share a focus on a hybrid model that places extra value on volume at independent restaurants, driving profitable growth,” he added.Just Eat Takeaway and Grubhub together processed 593m orders in 2019 and have more than 70 million active customers globally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f991a34345be8d0c0f4edd7f29c9acacbe4c353/0_88_4879_2928/master/4879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21528d2236516edf7396181711b3d1f","title":"us economy unemployment us states","story":"1.5m claims made for benefits in the past 12 weeks, a sign that layoffs are slowing from the peak of 6.6m in AprilAnother 1.5 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week even as states across the US continued to relax their coronavirus quarantine measures.Last week was the second week in a row that unemployment claims were below 2m, a sign that layoffs are slowing from the peak of 6.6m in April. The numbers, however, remain historically high. In the last recession, the highest number of weekly unemployment claims peaked at 665,000 in March 2009, and the previous all-time mark was 695,000 in October 1982.“The downward trend is obviously good news, but in the context of an economy that is reopening it is extremely high, especially when viewed against previous recessions,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, wrote in a note to investors.Jobless claims are an application for unemployment benefits submitted to a state labor department. The weekly numbers are seen as a proxy for unemployment trends but not an entirely reliable one. Not every person who is laid off applies for benefits, and not every inidual who applies will be counted as making a claim.\u0026nbspOn top of that states have struggled with the sheer volume of claims, leading to huge backlogs.The department of labor said the number of people actually receiving benefits (known as continuing claims) was 20.9 million for the week ending 30 May, a small decline from the week before.The numbers are also declining in part because of the Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal stimulus package worth nearly $3tn, that offers businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee salaries.“We are seeing the labor market high on PPP money,” said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. “Once it runs out we might see a significant increase in layoffs again.”Ashley Harris clocked off from her last shift as a cocktail server at Harrah’s Philadelphia Casino at 2am in mid-March. She had worked at the casino for 10 years and hopes to get rehired, but her most pressing concern is the imminent end of the federal government’s $600-a-week expanded unemployment insurance scheme and her health insurance.Harris said the end of the expanded benefits – currently set to expire at the end of July – will be devastating.“For them to just cut off the extra $600, which is helping, is going to affect me in more ways than I can ever imagine,” Harris said. “If I get sick, I won’t be able to pay bills.”Democrats are fighting for an extension to the $600 payments but face stiff opposition from Republicans who argue that it is a disincentive for people to return to work.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has reportedly told House Republicans the money “will not be in the next bill”.Reuters contributed to this article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ae71a2fae6838f34d3b1bbb9c8ed96ad3e667ee/0_134_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e7c174411944e0747513613e6da6ec4","title":"black lives matter racism bristol colston","story":"There are three powerful words that do expose discrimination. But you won’t find them on a poster, or chanted in the streetIf I hear one more white person say “Black Lives Matter” I think my head will explode. The slogan, powerful when first popularised by black people after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 in the US, has now become so ubiquitous as to have lost almost all meaning.\u0026nbspA way for people to endlessly repeat “I hate racism” while doing nothing to actually stop it.\u0026nbspWhite people, I assume you don’t like the idea of other people being treated as inferior just because of the colour of their skin. But that’s such a basic sentiment that you shouldn’t be giving yourself a buzz from saying it.When even Boris Johnson can say “Black Lives Matter”\u0026nbsp– the same Boris Johnson who talks of African piccaninnies, of “bank robber” burqa wearers, who leads a party riven by Islamophobia but refuses a proper investigation into it, and who was part of a government that deported black British citizens, and continues the injustice of the hostile environment to this day – well, you know the slogan’s cultural appropriation is complete.\u0026nbspEven racists hate racism. That’s why they’re always looking for ways to excuse what they do. “It’s not my fault – black people are just a bit more criminal than white people.” “I’m not being racist – it’s just that a lot of Muslims are terrorists.” “I’d love to recruit a black person – it’s just that they’re not quite the right fit for this role.”“It’s just that …” You won’t find this chanted in a city square by thousands of protesters, but these are probably the three most powerful words in the history of institutional racism. They’re the words people say in private – or don’t say – when they’re making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.\u0026nbspOver the past few days I’ve wondered, why\u0026nbspnow? Why,\u0026nbspafter all we’ve known about police brutality against black people,\u0026nbspare people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there’s not a lot else for young people to do.\u0026nbspThe anger is genuine, but the usual distractions that stop people from turning out have gone.\u0026nbspIt’s the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.\u0026nbspBut the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations,\u0026nbspfor most white people there’s always been a get-out.No white person\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspcould believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.That’s why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people\u0026nbspdeclaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.\u0026nbspThough \u0026nbspmany of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they’re starting to notice.\u0026nbspThis was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd,\u0026nbspwould the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?Many British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But\u0026nbspwhat a glorious moment. It’s an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say “Black Lives Matter” a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.\u0026nbspWhen I saw\u0026nbspFloyd’s life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the\u0026nbspBlack Lives Matter\u0026nbspmovement swept across the US in 2014.\u0026nbspSurely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions.\u0026nbspThere are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we’re going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won’t be by simply calling for more black police officers. That’s been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won’t be just by rooting out “bad apples”: a system that allows them\u0026nbspin unchecked\u0026nbspin the first place is already rotten to the core. It won’t simply be by giving all officers “ersity training”: a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they’re back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.\u0026nbspOn the day\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthe first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday,\u0026nbspthe politan police commissioner, Cressida Dick,\u0026nbspwas giving evidence to the London assembly.\u0026nbspShe\u0026nbspwas talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown – double the rate for white people.This is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels,\u0026nbspthat affect\u0026nbspthousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.\u0026nbspBarack Obama\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspset out an intelligent long-term plan – “How to make this moment the turning point for real change” – which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.\u0026nbspIn the UK we have to be equally thoughtful – so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias. Black Lives Matter is a catchy slogan. But right now, action is what really matters.• Joseph Harker is the deputy Opinion editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41af6b3f4e405f84d5c615a3241b5947c70bef08/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67cf8d69014122c967eb178ba66be5e8","title":"pandemic scientists second wave coronavirus","story":"A second wave of coronavirus cases would be disastrous – but there are ways to prevent this happeningOver the weekend, there were no new deaths from coronavirus in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Slowly, the number of hospitalisations and deaths is falling across the UK. Rather than celebrating these early signs that the worst of the pandemic could be behind us, however,\u0026nbspsome scientists are warning\u0026nbspof a second wave of infections – an increase in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks or months, which could occur even after a sustained fall\u0026nbspin the number of cases.\u0026nbspThese warnings often refer back to the 1918 flu pandemic. That outbreak killed tens of millions of people\u0026nbspwhen it returned the following winter in a deadlier form\u0026nbspafter the first outbreak had been controlled.\u0026nbspBut there’s a confusing lack of consensus from scientists about whether we’ll see a second wave of coronavirus cases.\u0026nbspAlthough the future is uncertain, we can imagine four scenarios for what might come next.\u0026nbspOne\u0026nbsphypothesis, floated by doctors in Italy, is that coronavirus could grow weaker as it spreads. Through viral mutation, Sars-Cov-2 could lose its potency and become milder or less infectious.\u0026nbspBut coronaviruses have proven a remarkably stable type of virus.\u0026nbspThere is no evidence to support this kind of mutation occurring in a matter of years, let alone weeks. Rather than viral mutations, improvements in survival rates in Italy are probably related to better clinical management of Covid-19, as doctors learn how to treat patients in hospital more effectively.But the picture might be more complex.\u0026nbspA recent study\u0026nbspreported that iniduals who had never been exposed to Sars-Cov-2 still\u0026nbsphad T-cells reacting to the virus, another key component of the body’s immune response. The authors of the study suggested that having previous exposure to common cold coronaviruses could\u0026nbspmean the body is able\u0026nbspto detect the proteins in the Sars-Cov-2 virus.\u0026nbspWhile this finding could be promising, there is still no\u0026nbspevidence that either antibodies or T-cell reactivity would result in\u0026nbspsomeone developing immunity to Sars-Cov-2.A third approach, which has been deliberately adopted in Sweden, is to let the virus run its course and spread through the population. This treats Covid-19 much like the influenza virus until a vaccine becomes available or enough of the population is exposed that herd immunity develops, the virus will be unstoppable.But the cost of allowing the virus to spread through the population until it develops herd immunity is that many people will become\u0026nbspill\u0026nbspor die as a result of catching Covid-19. And with no confirmation on how long immunity would even last, this approach offers no certainty about whether people could become reinfected after a couple of months or years – leading to a second wave of infections.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMy own view is that\u0026nbspwe can avoid a\u0026nbspsecond wave\u0026nbspif governments aggressively contain the virus through testing, tracing and isolating carriers, and by encouraging good hygiene, such as hand-washing and environmental disinfection, supported by physical distancing where it’s needed. The goal is to drive down numbers of cases to a low level so that transmission is limited to discrete, containable outbreaks with the ultimate goal of elimination.\u0026nbspThink of this\u0026nbspas a series of constantly emerging small fires that need to be extinguished quickly before they turn into an uncontrollable blaze. South Korea and Germany have effectively run with this approach,\u0026nbsprolling out mass testing and tracing strategies, isolating carriers of the virus and implementing monitoring systems to map its spread.But the focus on deaths from a second wave may miss the real toll of the virus: the\u0026nbsplong-term damage\u0026nbspit can cause to the lungs, heart, kidneys, brain and even blood vessels among those who recover. This is emerging as one of the horrors of Covid-19. It is often forgotten that Covid-19 is a new virus, completely different to the flu, and that it might have longer-term health impacts that will only be identified in months or years.If coronavirus is\u0026nbspour generation’s polio, we might look towards the approach taken by governments in the Pacific.\u0026nbspNew Zealand has eliminated coronavirus, and Australia is\u0026nbspinching closer\u0026nbspto this goal. With border checks in place, people living in these countries can return to normal life. Sports matches are taking place in New Zealand, schools have reopened, weddings are being booked and\u0026nbsppeople can safely see relatives.\u0026nbspThe successes of New Zealand and Australia might force other countries to rethink their own strategies, and the feasibility of eliminating the virus within their borders. Instead of living with a constant threat of Covid-19, people might start asking their own governments – why not\u0026nbsptry to get rid of it altogether?• Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66d1e5c64435290f05f222d9379212923c1e98f1/0_0_5246_3148/master/5246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4027ea4edacf33de7c08ee79e79e6cf2","title":"schools coronavirus policy children parents teachers primary","story":"The U-turn on reopening primary schools is confusing, dangerous, and sadly typical of this governmentThe plan was simple, if logistically impossible. Our government would ensure every primary pupil would attend school for at least a few weeks before the summer holidays. Two weeks into schools opening their doors to all pupils, the government dropped its “ambition”. During this period, just under half of schools remained closed because the government continued its unfortunate habit of over promising and under delivering.If the government had bothered to read even its own rules on school reopenings, it might have worked out that its plans were unworkable – just like when Boris Johnson told us at the beginning of March that the UK was “very well prepared” for the virus. But then doctors and nurses couldn’t get their hands on personal protective equipment. Or when he said “the country is going to get through this in good shape, no doubt at all”, only for us to find that, as of 10 days ago, we have so far suffered the second highest death rate from the pandemic in the world.\u0026nbspAnyone with a working knowledge of how to ide by two might have spotted the problem for primary schools. Primary school pupils were, the government said, to be taught in bubbles of 15 in order to maintain some form of social distancing. The average primary class size is 27, meaning schools would immediately require double the number of teachers and classrooms. That’s before we even factor in those that are shielding as a result of their or a loved one’s underlying health conditions. Perhaps the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, was also acting upon “instinct” when he insisted all primary pupils could return to school for four weeks.\u0026nbspIt’s worth mentioning that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies warned that the government’s test track and trace system needed to be functional before schools reopened. Cue Johnson declaring that it would be “world-beating” and “in place by 1 June”. The system however, won’t be “fully operational” until September.When teachers voiced misgivings at the government’s refusal to release modelling of its guidance, and suggested it all appeared unfeasible, parts of the press first claimed that teachers were in open conflict with our unions – the very bodies we join to represent us. The unions were cast as barons, heedless and unwilling to respect our eager pleas to return and endanger our pupils, families and selves. This narrative tired quickly, and was replaced with one as well worn as my favourite PJs. Teachers, as perennial shirkers, were, in this new version of the story, refusing to “step up” in the nation’s time of need. The problem was that we were too used to long holidays and clocking off at 3pm. It had nothing to do with a lack of trust in a government that had managed to let the virus run wild in care homes, leaving our most vulnerable to fend for themselves. Teachers couldn’t be forgiven for thinking the series of bungled measures was a sign that our government just might not have a clue.In the week before schools closed in March, the WhatsApp group chat for my daughter’s reception class pinged incessantly with messages. Parents were split between deep distrust of the government’s prevarication and a willingness to give them the benefit of doubt. All of us were struggling, if we were honest, to find a rationale behind the stuttering decision-making of our leaders.\u0026nbspWhat was the government doing keeping schools open when our closest neighbours – Ireland, France, Germany, Spain and Italy – had already closed theirs? What should parents do in the face of this foot-dragging? Keep children at school, for their family’s sanity, or at home? Those who were being charitable asked for temperance. Our government surely had a credible plan? Somewhere. Right?\u0026nbspIn the end, it gave two days’ notice that schools would be closed indefinitely but would remain open to the very vulnerable and children of key workers. This was not clear guidance, given in good time, but a back of the napkin, you-go-on-ahead-and-we’ll-get-back-to-you-on-the-details kind of leadership, a sadly typical feature of Johnson’s government throughout the pandemic.\u0026nbspThe scheme to provide vouchers to families of children on free school meals also ended in failure. Edenred, contracted to distribute £234m worth of vouchers to more than 1m homes, did not go through the process of a competitive tender. Thousands were left to go hungry, with teachers donating food or referring families to food banks. And what of the scheme to get 200,000 laptops and tablets to disadvantaged pupils struggling to study at home? Well, that too has had delays. Though, if you believe Gavin Williamson, it remains “on target”. We can’t, I suppose, be surprised.\u0026nbspWhen it comes to schools, at every stage, the government has botched its handling of the pandemic. When you factor in care homes, PPE, and test track and trace, it looks very much like business as usual.• Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and  columnist focusing on race, politics, education and feminism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1c8cd59478d1b8d37f6a90eb6af0ed0429728ee/7_49_5118_3071/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea36f889d24db95e5bc630d593052bf","title":"i cant afford my student housing during lockdown so im striking","story":"Tomasz Jabłoński is one of around 200 tenants on a rent strike in his student accommodation buildingI was working in a pub before the coronavirus outbreak, which was enough to cover my rent at Dinwiddy House in King’s Cross during my first year studying social anthropology at Soas University of London. I was also getting some money from my family back in Poland, to help with food and other basics. But I was put on furlough when the coronavirus lockdown started at the end of March, and I returned home.I rented from the student housing company Sanctuary Students, who are demanding that I pay during lockdown, even though I don’t use the facilities and left the room completely empty, and also won’t be back in the UK until about January next year because my course is going to be online. This is a time when other housing providers have offered students a pass on this term’s rent, and I strongly believe\u0026nbspthis is what Sanctuary Students should do too. So, along with around 200 other students, I joined a rent strike.Sanctuary Students is treating us as if we are only using the pandemic to get away without paying rent, not people who just left their accommodation to be with our families and loved ones due to the virus. Many of us lost jobs and just cannot pay.\u0026nbspWe agreed that we should stand in solidarity until they release us from our contracts.I then received a letter from a debt collection company asking me to pay the outstanding debt of £1,735.69 in seven days, threatening me that if not, they would take more direct action against me.When I got this letter, I talked to the students’ union and they told me they were contacting lawyers to figure out how to approach this. I also told the debt collector that I’m involved in a strike and that they shouldn’t contact me directly, and to negotiate with the students’ union. We wrote an open letter signed by many people who are living in Sanctuary Students housing, and we’re waiting to see what happens next.I’m very anxious about how this situation will develop. I worry that, if I go back to London next year, I won’t be able to get accommodation, and if I have outstanding debts my credit score will be lowered.\u0026nbspIt hasn’t been possible to work in Poland, so I couldn’t collect enough money to pay the rent even if I wanted to. I can’t be sure I’ll be rehired by the pub when I’m back in the UK either. My parents are trying to help me in any way possible but they can’t do much. They don’t have enough money, and they don’t really understand the situation in London.\u0026nbspWe’re standing firm.

Now it’s finally over. I am very happy for the person who found it.”An eccentric New Mexico millionaire named Forrest Fenn said he hid the bronze chest in the Rockies in 2010. The only clues to the prize’s whereabouts were located in a cryptic 24-line poem written by Fenn and added to the last pages of his autobiography, The Thrill of the Chase.“Begin it where warm waters halt  And take it in the canyon down,  Not far, but too far to walk.  Put in below the home of Brown,” reads the second stanza of Fenn’s poem that would send treasure hunters to scour five western states.\u0026nbspOn 7 June, Fenn, a former air force fighter pilot turned art and antiquities dealer, told the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper that a man from the eastern US had recently located his treasure, which has variously been valued anywhere from $1m to $2m. According to Fenn’s website, it was found “under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than ten years ago”.Neither the name of the finder nor the location of the treasure has been disclosed. “I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot,” Fenn wrote on his website.\u0026nbspThe discovery marks the end of a modern-day treasure hunt unlike any in history.“This has been a horrible ending to something that has been so extremely important in my life for eight years,” said Cynthia Meachum, who is part of a vibrant “chase” community of Fenn treasure seekers. “It has affected me a lot more than I thought it ever would.”According to Fenn, the idea that came to inspire so many was conceived in 1988 after he was diagnosed with cancer.\u0026nbspThe prospect of death made him think to leave part of his fortune, and even his own bones,\u0026nbspin a treasure chest somewhere in the mountains. When Fenn beat cancer, the idea persisted, and he meticulously curated the contents of the chest for years.\u0026nbspFenn described a “necklace that’s about 2,000 years old, and it has fetishes made out of quartz crystal and cast gold jaguar claws, and it’s absolutely wonderful”, in a 2018 interview with the . “There are two ancient Chinese jade carvings of human faces.\u0026nbspYou just want to cry when you see them.”\u0026nbspFenn hoped the treasure would be an adventure that could get people “off the couch” and into the outdoors. “He provided us all with great adventure,” said Dent, who searched twice a week for years in northern New Mexico.\u0026nbspYet in the course of looking for Fenn’s chest, as many as five people have died, and Fenn has been criticized for endangering lives, enabling an unhealthy obsession, and even lying about the treasure’s existence.\u0026nbsp“I would implore him that he stop this nonsense,” the New Mexico state police chief, Pete Kassetas, said after a treasure hunter’s body was retrieved from the Rio Grande River in 2017, days after he had gone missing. He told ABC: “I want people to have fun, and I want people to be adventurous, but the reality is when you have $2m or so, as it’s rumored to be, at stake, people make poor decisions.”There are the stories of people quitting their jobs and emptying their bank accounts to pursue the chase. Fenn himself has received death threats and been the victim of break-in attempts at his house.\u0026nbspOthers have claimed the whole thing is an outright hoax.\u0026nbsp“I believe there never was any hidden treasure,” said Linda Bilyeu, ex-wife of Randy Bilyeu, who died searching for the treasure. “Fenn is a corrupt man who seeks attention any which way he could achieve.The controversy around the treasure has continued even after its purported discovery. The absence of photos or information on the location of the chest has led some to question whether it was found at all – though Fenn has promised to elaborate in the coming days.“Give us something, so we know if we were close,” said Meachum, who made 200 trips and invested thousands of hours. “ I have no closure at this point.”“A third think it’s a hoax,” said Dent. “A third think it was never found.\u0026nbspAnd then there are the rest of us that think this is great.\u0026nbspSomeone found it. Now let’s move on with our lives.”Even so, she felt enriched by the quest, if not the actual treasure.The victor “did something tens of thousands of people have failed to do.\u0026nbspIf I could say anything to the finder, I would tell him congratulations.\u0026nbspWe wish you all the happiness in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b994e7f2b5be6a239425e8a6131ab8aacb64c66/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e96c68ba10af96dfeda361373761646c","title":"swim good 10 of the best ethical swimwear pieces","story":"Two-pieces and one-pieces chosen by  styling editor Melanie Wilkinson for their sustainable credentials"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed2d062183cdc085f7f909d0f7d8022c4f39cd5/0_18_1860_1116/master/1860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba1127694c26a996a511678a7bfd55e3","title":"liverpool need to rebuild but werner may turn out to be a great non signing","story":"Jürgen Klopp’s squad is due for a period of renewal but the time was not right to sign the RB Leipzig attackerLook out.

Even better, all of them have been linked with a move to Liverpool in the last two months, a list of suggested transactions that bears repeating only because it is so absurd. We can only hope for the sake of his own sleep patterns that Jürgen Klopp has turned off that Google alert on his phone.There are of course significant caveats to this red-shirted shadow army. “Linked with” is weak gruel at the best of times, shorthand for hopeful agents and arm’s-length bluff. And of course lockdown does funny things to all of us. Right now there is an empty space where football should be, tended by an industry that still needs to produce content.But there is also an edge of reality buried beneath the mound of bodies, a shiver of anxiety as Liverpool’s final step towards the league title looms closer. This is driven in part by the question of what comes next. Something is happening here. But what exactly?The most recent near-miss isn’t on that list. This is of course Timo Werner, who may or may not reach an agreement with Chelsea this week, but who has already become a very public Liverpool non-signing. It is an interesting move in itself, failure to recruit a player presented by Klopp as an act rather than an omission, as a positive choice, another part of a commercially-sound team-building strategy.At £53m Werner was simply the right man in the wrong moment of total economic collapse. Such is the level of trust in Klopp and the club’s owners that this seems pretty reasonable. Footballing lore insists that great teams always build from a position of strength: a line that tends to overlook the wider truth that, weak or strong, in football you always need to be building, that even the finest teams exist in a state of constant disintegration.It is this point that some supporters feel most keenly. Liverpool are champions of Europe. Liverpool spent the first six months of the season marching the rest of the field around the Premier League in a headlock. Liverpool have the most resourceful elite-level manager in the world.And yet, there is also an acceptance that a team built on coaching and chemistry is in need of some urgent refreshing. Werner is a high-class player. His arrival would have reflected the success of recent methods, where large amounts have been spent, but on the right players in just the right spot.There is still time. A high-class central defender and a versatile attacker (plenty on that shadow list) are still wanted. But teams are also fragile things. Time is passing. How often do these moments come around, when every element of an organisation aligns on the same course, when a wider generational success can be seen bedding into place?And how often does such a moment coincide with a wider economic collapse and a four-month pause in the workings of everyday life? Liverpool have, above all, been terribly unlucky with timing.This misfortune applies to the recruitment cycle. The significant period of evolution for the current team was between summer 2017 and summer 2018. During that year Alisson, Fabinho, Andy Robertson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah all arrived, while Trent Alexander-Arnold emerged as a first-team player.It has been a brilliant spell of team building. But by the time football returns it will be two years since Liverpool signed a significant player and 12 regular first-team squad members will be 28 or older. Alexander-Arnold is the only young player in the first XI. A period of renewal is due. Klopp knows this better than anyone. It was clearly coming this summer.At which point: enter one global meltdown. The plans hatched to manage this will have been based on a previous version of reality, one in which it made sense to pay large amounts for a single high-class addition, and where commercial and TV income seemed guaranteed in perpetuity.These are fragile margins, too. To reach this stage, to win the Champions League while also achieving record profits, is a wonderful achievement. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Success is a brittle thing. Imagine throwing a broken season plus total business model collapse into the workings of Manchester United 1992, Chelsea 2004 or Barcelona 2005. Success would still come. But earthquakes hardly help, not least ones that seem geared to attack specifically your own points of strength.On the pitch the current Liverpool is built around extreme physicality and beautifully-grooved team chemistry, all of which have been interrupted. It is also a style built with the home crowd in mind, a way of playing that feeds on shared energy. Liverpool haven’t lost a significant domestic match at Anfield in over two years. This is all part of the design, formulated within parameters that have now disappeared. Same for everyone. But how many others had cracked it to this degree?The commercial landscape has also changed. Liverpool became the best club team on the planet by playing the existing rules perfectly. Klopp and Fenway Sports Group have been kings of the FFP era, obeying the rules of engagement and exploiting their own resources better than anyone else at that level in Europe.Well, say goodbye to all that. It is fairly clear that financial fair play will be given minimal policing from here as football looks to rake in every penny it can. A club like Chelsea is suddenly back in that position of power, with access to a bottomless set of pockets, and prepared to spend speculatively.The game has changed. Will Liverpool change with it?Not so far, and rightly so. Be true to thine own self: the most Klopp-era thing Liverpool could have done at a time of falling revenues, pay cuts and social ision was to walk away from a £200,000-a-week new signing.There will no doubt be money to spend. But success to date has arrived hand in hand with being able to read the room, and in this case the commercial management has once again followed its instincts. Who knows, in time Werner-to-Liverpool might turn out to be one of the great non-signings, an era-defining non-signing. For now Klopp and FSG have earned the time and the space to find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9110ef1cbde85f63206831829fb43d561996037e/0_127_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ec7bdef032d6c623ffdf7ff86750056","title":"premier league restart preview everton","story":"Carlo Ancelotti’s side entered the break in poor form and maybe he will now give young players, such as Anthony Gordon and Lewis Gibson, a chanceWhat was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? Carlo Ancelotti entered lockdown brooding over a painful reality check with his new club. It could be one that benefits him and Everton in the long-term, however. Five wins in his first eight Premier League matches, building on the fine work of Duncan Ferguson as caretaker manager, had encouraged talk from the manager of European qualification and only minor repair work being necessary in the summer transfer market. Anyone who has watched an expensively-assembled squad toil over recent seasons knew both to be hugely optimistic assessments.Everton remain a long way off realising the ambitions of the majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri and their three-times Champions League winning manager. That would have been brought home to Ancelotti when his team blew a two-goal lead in stoppage time against Newcastle, in defeat at Arsenal and especially in the 4-0 reverse at Chelsea in the final game before lockdown. The positives as football entered its enforced break were the new five-year contracts signed by Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Mason Holgate.What about now? The return to contact training has at least allowed Ancelotti more time to impose his ideas at Finch Farm, albeit in a restricted fashion. It is time the manager would not usually have had after arriving in mid-season, and the onus is on players he inherited to prove they belong in his long-term plans. One area he is keen to strengthen is central midfield. The squad was beset by injuries in that department prior to lockdown, which offers one explanation for that sorry display at Chelsea, but that situation has barely improved since 13 March.Jean-Philippe Gbamin, last summer’s £22.5m intended replacement for Idrissa Gueye, had hoped to offer a solution in the restart after recovering from the quadriceps injury that has blighted his campaign. But he is now out until next year after suffering an achilles injury in training. Morgan Schneiderlin is several weeks away from returning from a knee operation he underwent in February while another training-ground thigh injury, this time to Yerry Mina, means Everton have only two central defenders available for the restart. Theo Walcott has also been ruled out for four weeks after abdominal surgery.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? A first Merseyside derby win for almost 10 years would be a good start. There remains an outside chance of Europe, with six points separating Wolves in sixth from Everton in 12th, although it would require major and consistent improvement for Ancelotti’s team to climb that high. It is arguably more important to determine who should be part of next season’s plans, who needs to go and for his tactical vision to take shape. There are high hopes at Goodison for the 19-year-old Anthony Gordon. The restart offers opportunity for the forward to build on his two Premier League substitute appearances. Likewise, given the injury situation in central defence, Lewis Gibson could get a chance to press his claim although Everton would need special dispensation to re-register the 19-year-old after a loan season at Fleetwood. It is also time for Moise Kean to justify Everton’s £24.5m investment.Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? Everton acted immediately to help the local community when the pandemic struck, launching a £50,000 ‘Blue Family’ campaign that involved charity staff delivering emergency food parcels, medical prescriptions and fuel vouchers to those in need. Players and management took part in the thousands of phone calls the club made to elderly and isolated people. All of which explained the club’s anger, and disciplinary action, when Moise Kean was filmed breaching lockdown rules at a house party.Any unsungcommunity heroes? Everton in the Community staff have worked tirelessly during lockdown, with players and Ancelotti also helping out. A donation from Seamus Coleman, who was prominent in the Players Together initiative with Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson, helped the Irish comedian Stevo Timothy raise over €60,000 for the Irish Wheelchair Association. Timothy took on the challenge of cycling 5km despite being partially paralysed following a spinal injury in 2005.Key player in the run-in? Calvert-Lewin. The striker’s huge development this season had fuelled talk of an England call-up before the pandemic struck and, with 13 league goals and a new five-year contract, he will be looking to reassert those credentials during the run-in.End-of-season-prediction Just scraping into the top 10."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7bacb26a0303d599ea8143d77992110bd5ba66/0_286_3409_2044/master/3409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efb20fbd94447ebc4bffa4c894fae3ff","title":"europe major leagues prepare for restart football weekly extra podcast","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Sid Lowe, Archie Rhind-Tutt and Nicky Bandini to compare how Spain, Italy and Germany have approached the resumption of football.

Parkrun sadly remains in hibernation but everything else has bloomed. In my local park there are the joggers, cyclists, speed walkers, guys doing chin-ups on the goalposts, iniduals stretching on mats, small groups doing workouts and the yoga enthusiasts with their sun salutations. Meanwhile, next door, the neighbours are impressively in the back yard every morning, hamstrings at the ready for Joe Wicks.Before the coronavirus, the gym industry was booming. Ten million people – one in seven of the entire population – had a gym membership and as a country we were spending a record £5bn on keeping fit.Almost all of that spending has come to a shuddering halt, with Britain’s 7,000 gyms and leisure centres still firmly shut. Will enough of us ever go back, now that new habits have been formed (the expansion in cycling is remarkable) and we have learned how to keep fit without paying costly monthly fees?People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Reopening day for leisure facilities is scheduled for 4 July, with gyms in stage three of the government’s Covid-19 recovery roadmap. But if they do reopen on that date, they will look very, very different. In Switzerland, when gyms reopened in May after a two-month lockdown, members were told to arrive and leave in their gym clothes to avoid changing rooms, group exercise classes were banned as they simply couldn’t feasibly meet two-metre distancing requirements in studios, while lots of fitness machines were marked out of bounds. Users are expected to thoroughly wipe down every machine after use, with an army of cleaners thoroughly disinfecting the kit every hour.The keenest users of gyms – urban 20- to 40-year-olds – have been among the worst hit by coronavirus job losses, which will only magnify when the furlough scheme ends. Monthly direct debits to the gym will be the first thing to be scrubbed.What’s more, many gyms are now in the wrong place. If office workers do not return in any number until after the summer, with a possible permanent increase in working from home, city centre gyms will start to look somewhat redundant.The gym chain owner and former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne believes people prefer the more structured exercise routines that gyms offer.“We recently asked our members if they would be confident to return to their local health club in June or July if the correct safety measures are in place and more than two-thirds agreed they would,” he said as he joined a campaign launched this week to back the safe reopening of gyms.We can also be certain that the allure of outdoor activity will lessen into autumn. Who is really going to work out in the park on a cold, dark and miserable evening in November?But, ahem, what about the delicate matter of sweat? Can’t say I fancy a cloud of no-pain, no-gain sweat wafting into me as I venture through a gym in an era of coronavirus.The industry knows it’s the question on the lips of many a club user. In a myth-busting Q\u0026ampA guide sent to the clubs by ukactive this week, the very first question is: “Can you pass Covid-19 from sweat?” And their answer? “No, there is no current evidence that the virus can be spread by perspiration (sweat).” It cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although it admits there is “limited data available on sweatperspiration”.In truth, the industry is putting a brave face on calamitous times. It knows that thousands of gyms and leisure operators could be forced out of business by crippling rent payments, which come back into effect at the end of this month.That’s an issue for returning gym goers, too. Who is going to pay upfront for another 12-month gym membership to a club teetering on bankruptcy?Unless the industry follows the Ryanair playbook and offers huge cut-price offers to get us back, or receives a government leg-up (it is pushing hard for a cycle-to-work-style tax rebate on gym membership), then it faces grim times indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26278156c75784985bae2cb1ff1232b3c2c922a7/0_2_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56a32bfda860658e5af8bb470fb8e92d","title":"relative ran up 1000 phone credit but cant get a refund","story":"Vodafone isn’t able to override its computer system and get her the money backA relative in her eighties has managed to accrue a credit of nearly £1,000 on her Vodafone pay-as-you-go mobile. She believed she had to top up her credit regularly using a top-up card, partly due to texts from Vodafone warning her that she’d lose her free minutes and rewards unless she did.Vodafone says it is willing to refund her but is unable to do so unless she uses a debit card to top up the account further, so her bank details are with the account. However, this is not possible as the system does not allow debit card payments if the credit balance is more than £700.Several hours on the telephone have established that there is apparently nobody, in one of the biggest companies in the world, able to override a computer system in order to manually link a customer’s bank details with a mobile phone account and process a refund. She only uses the phone rarely, so reducing the balance by £300 is likely to take many more years than her remaining life.GW, CumbriaIt is dismaying that Vodafone continued to text incentives to top up the account when the credit was already eye-watering. And it’s concerning that there is no upper credit limit to prevent such errors, especially since there is no obligation on telecoms firms to refund unused credit if a customer switches provider.Vodafone finally found a way round the problem when contacted by the Observer. It turned out the PAYG account was linked to the details of a grandson who had helped her set it up in store years previously.“We’d like to say sorry for the experience, and we have arranged to refund her the full amount,” it says. “We acknowledge that customers shouldn’t be able to run up such credit levels on our pay-as-you-go services.

More Modern Classics came with sleeve notes written by Weller himself, which ended with a gruff message to his audience: “Don’t be scared of the new, don’t get bogged down in the cliches of, ‘Oh it’s not as good as …’ or you’ll miss out on what is NOW.” You could say that’s a bit rich coming from Weller, a revivalist from the start, who furthermore could be found in the midst of his 90s renaissance informing the late music writer David Cavanagh that “everything’s shit after 68”. Then again, the Weller who admonished his fans against looking back was in the middle of one of his periodic, confounding career resets.After years sticking fast to a well-turned but increasingly hoary brand of trad rock, he unexpectedly unleashed a succession of sprawling, chaotic, grippingly experimental albums on which avant-garde electronic instrumentals fought for space with off-kilter acid folk, spiky guitar noise, free improvisation on the piano and songs that came in five-part suites. Weller sounded re-energised, the reviews were ecstatic, but the response from the rump of his fanbase – the feather cut-sporting dads who may well represent the world’s first middle-aged youth cult – was decidedly mixed.From 2017, A Kind Revolution and the following year’s True Meanings offered the conservative wing of his fanbase some consolation – the former dialled down the experimentation, the latter explored an acoustic strand of his writing you could trace back to the Jam’s English Rose and Liza Radley – but Weller clearly isn’t done springing surprises yet. His first release of 2020 was an EP of musique concrète-style instrumentals on the left-field electronic label Ghost Box. Which brings us to On Sunset, an album on which he gamely attempts to meld the competing desires to be the keeper of musical traditions and a modernist in the original sense of the phrase: if you were looking for a spiritual forebear in Weller’s catalogue, you might alight on 1980’s Sound Affects, where the influence of the era’s wilfully jarring post-punk was overlaid with his obsession with mid-60s Beatles.At one extreme are opener Mirror Ball and Earth Beat. The former goes on for nearly eight minutes and contains shimmering synths that wouldn’t sound entirely out of place on a mainstream 2020 pop single, Beach Boys-worthy harmony vocals, a weird moment where it appears to be shifting into an entirely different tempo before deciding against it, a lengthy free-form interlude that could have come off the aforementioned Ghost Box EP and a lo-fi piano coda. Despite a title that suggests something unspeakable you might stumble across on one of Glastonbury’s outlying stages involving a didgeridoo and a rapping crusty, Earth Beat is a dramatic reworking of The Willows, a track from Ghost Box co-founder Jim Jupp’s 2004 debut as the Belbury Poly, reshaping the original’s eerie electronics into a kind of warped soul track with guest appearance from rising London R\u0026ampB artist Col3trane and a glam-era glitter-beat.Another curveball comes with Equanimity, which features Jim Lea of Slade on violin and sounds like David Bowie, an artist Weller paid open homage to on True Meanings: not, it’s worth noting, the Bowie of Ziggy Stardust or Low, but the Bowie found on his eponymous 1967 debut, in thrall to music hall and Anthony Newley’s brand of musical theatre. At the other extreme, meanwhile, there’s Baptiste and On Sunset, offering warm, soul-infused rock that could have been released in 1969 and 1972 respectively.The rest lurks somewhere in between, offering gentle disruptions of the familiar. More offers the kind of relaxed bucolic sound found on 1993’s Wild Wood, but underpinned by a taut, metronomic bass line that leans towards krautrock. Old Father Tyme has a naggingly familiar guitar riff weaving through satisfyingly off-beam production – a drum machine fades in and out of the mix, Weller’s vocal comes decorated with little bursts of dubby echo – and one of a number of lyrics on which Weller, who spent his early years as a songwriter obsessed with his own youth, addresses ageing with surprising equanimity. There’s a lot of stuff here about contentment and growing into yourself: “Not a thing I’d change if I could, I’m happy here in my neighbourhood,” he sings in On Sunset.You could, if you were so minded, mourn the sonic shock value of 22 Dreams or Wake Up the Nation, or indeed raise a quizzical eyebrow at how much the electric piano-flecked Village resembles the kind of relaxed mid-70s rock that bands like the Jam set themselves in spiky opposition to. But you’d have a hard time arguing that On Sunset doesn’t work as an album, held together not just by its overriding lyrical theme but uniformly strong melodies. As exercises in trying to have your cake and eat it go, it’s pretty impressive.• On Sunset is released on Polydor on 3 July.Róisín Murphy: Murphy’s Law (Cosmodelica remix)Murphy’s recent artistic roll continues unabated: a fabulous nu-disco reworking of her recent single, complete with demented lockdown video."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71dabb521bc7e99a7402ed3bd84493f91b142bf5/809_415_2116_1269/master/2116.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6b7c85534e2c2e209cedb37f9bccb7c2","title":"stormzy to donate 10m to black british causes over ten years","story":"The uncomfortable truth that our country continuously fails to recognise and admit is that black people in the UK have been at a constant disadvantage in every aspect of life – simply due to the colour of our skin.

People still argue over how successful that first assumption was, but with this recording he puts his own stamp on it. Kaufmann’s Otello starts out as less the swaggering hero, more the serious commanding officer, and as he becomes more and more defined by his own instability he alternates between a taut, intense tone of anger and certainty and a less tightly focused, more burnished voice full of doubt – at times it’s almost a Jekyll-and-Hyde-type characterisation, but a subtler one than that might suggest. He dies well: quietly and movingly.His Desdemona is a relative newcomer, Federica Lombardi, whose light and fresh-sounding soprano plays up the young bride’s innocence beautifully. There’s a little more depth to Verdi’s characterisation of her than she conveys here, but it’s not one of the composer’s most rounded roles: he, like Shakespeare and everyone else, was much more interested in Iago. He sounds properly dangerous as sung by Carlos Álvarez – forceful but smooth, he’s as much in control as Otello is volatile, and he sings his nihilistic Credo with relish, the orchestra hurtling along with him until the mention of death brings a moment of pause to make your skin crawl. Here and elsewhere,\u0026nbspAntonio Pappano’s pacing wrings all the drama out of the music, without semaphoring or turning self-conscious. Whether building the mounting urgency of Otello and Desdemona’s confrontation or weaving the web of Iago’s deceit as he frames Cassio, Pappano gets an unflaggingly vivid performance from his Rome orchestra, and you could argue that the odd rough edge in the choral ensemble just adds to the drama. This Otello may be Kaufmann’s showcase, but it’s Pappano who really makes it sing.Other top-rank tenors are available. Vincerò!, Piotr Beczała’s new disc with the Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana and conductor Marco Boemi, finds him with plenty of juice in the tank for a calling-card collection of Italian arias by Puccini and others.

It emphasises that this is a “targeted intervention” directed at those who have been cut off from family and friends during lockdown. So what does the new law mean?What’s happening?In England, from 13 June, if you live by yourself or are a single parent with dependent children – in other words, if there is only one adult in your home – you can expand your household to include one other household of any size. These are being called support bubbles.So can grandparents now visit their grandchildren and have them to stay in their own homes?Yes and no. One grandparent who lives on their own can form a bubble with one of their grown-up children. But families with two lone grandparents need to choose which grandparent they link up with.Can my partner stay the night with me?Yes, as long as one of you lives alone and you’re in an exclusive bubble.What about parents who have separated but who have children under 18?You’re already allowed to operate as though you’re in a bubble. You can form a bubble with another household, as long as it contains only a single adult.I live alone but I’m shielding. Can I form a bubble?\u0026nbspAfraid not. But the government will be setting out further advice next week targeting this group.Can I be in a bubble if I’m clinically vulnerable or have a higher risk of catching coronavirus?If you are at a higher risk of exposure (for example, if someone in your house is a healthcare worker), you should take particular care when deciding whether to form a bubble and with whom.What can I do in a bubble?You can behave as though you live under the same roof with the other people in your bubble: you’re one big family. You can also share things such as sport or garden equipment.Are bubbles safe?The risk of infection rises with the number of people in a bubble and the number of interactions you have with people you do not live with. Good hygiene remains important even for those in the same bubble: keep washing your hands and sneezing into a tissue.How can I get to those in my bubble?There is no limit on how far you can travel but the government recommends that you form a bubble with someone who lives locally, so that you can continue to avoid using public transport and can cycle or walk if possible.I’ve chosen my bubble. Is there anything I can’t do?You can’t change your mind. You can’t swap bubbles or expand them to include more than one household.What happens if someone in my support bubble develops coronavirus symptoms or we come into contact with someone else who does?You all have to stay at home. If you or a member of your bubble is contacted as part of the test and trace programme, the inidual contacted must stay at home. If the inidual becomes symptomatic, everyone in the bubble must then isolate.\u0026nbspI’ve just returned to the UK from abroad. Can I form a bubble or immediately rejoin my previous bubble?No. You need to self-isolate in one place for 14 days first.\u0026nbspI’m not eligible to form a bubble. Can I still see my friends and family?This is a targeted intervention for those who really need it. The safest thing is for us all to continue limiting our contact with others by staying at home. You can continue meeting outdoors in a group of up to six people including those you do not live with, as long as you keep at least 2 metres apart.What happens if I break the new rules?The relevant authorities, including the police, have the powers to enforce them through fines and dispersing gatherings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b143716c88576fcd713bd51766c974077eecb103/3175_2203_10517_6315/master/10517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6b8027eb6c91700715ac43e9bc4be44","title":"how to use music to boost your running whether over a mile or a marathon","story":"From music’s effects on fatigue to its motivational properties, the right soundtrack is a powerful tool for improving your ability to run wellEveryone knows there’s a link between music and running. Barely a gym lets a cross-training machine go unaccompanied by hi-NRG dance tunes. There’s a great choice of running playlists on Spotify, some with millions of likes from users who’ve found that the right music can push them farther and faster. Bruce Springsteen has even written a whole album about being born to run. But if you want to use music to help improve your running, it’s important to get to grips with the science, and how it applies to your running style.Given that most runners tend to follow a pace of 150 to 180 steps per minute, you need music that corresponds to that. One option is to pick music that has about 150-180bpm, so that you can match your steps to the beat. “Foo Fighters’ The Pretender, which has about 170bpm, is really, really popular with runners,” says Hallett.However, 150-180bpm is very fast in terms of tempo, so there’s relatively little recorded at those speeds – with the exception of more high-energy rock’n’roll, thrash metal or speed garage. So another option is to aim for music that matches your stride cycle – ie two steps rather than one. This lets you pick music that’s much slower. Something that’s particularly good? Hip-hop.One of the most pleasant ways to run is to do so in what’s known as a “flow state”. It’s a highly enjoyable feeling of being completely immersed in what you’re doing to the point where it’s as though you’re on autopilot, but which is in itself highly enjoyable. It’s also been shown to enhance running endurance.Karageorghis did a study where he ran people to exhaustion during a beep test and found that those who listened to music more easily entered flow state. But in order to enter flow state, it’s important to have the right listening experience. The more continuous the listening experience, the easier it is to enter flow state. So if you’re planning to go on a reasonably lengthy run, it’s best to avoid music with ads, and to ensure you’re not listening in a way that might be interrupted by poor signal. Using Spotify Premium, with ad-free music and offline listening, is one way to keep the flow state flowing, if you will. “Having interrupted music can be a little distracting and disconcerting – it’s not as beneficial as having continuous music,” says Karageorghis. “That’s why I often encourage people to create end-to-end playlists that contour their workout.”One of the most important ways that music can help take your running to the next level is by making you feel less tired when you exercise. When you’re listening to a soundtrack, you’re giving your brain something to process other than your physical activity. The music distracts it from focusing on the effect exercise is having on your body, so the parts of the brain that speak to each other to communicate fatigue are less able to do so – meaning you feel less exhausted than you otherwise would.“It’s as though the music takes up some of your brain’s bandwidth that would normally be used for communication with the working muscles and the organs,” says Karageorghis. “It limits the degree to which fatigue-related signals can enter conscious awareness.”One thing that is unaffected by how fast you’re running is music’s ability to make you feel like you’re enjoying yourself. Even at higher intensities, studies have found that music can make people enjoy exercise more than they otherwise would.Karageorghis has also found that not only does music enhance how pleasurable your run is, but it enhances your memory of your run. It makes you remember your runs more positively, associates them more with being positive experiences and increases your probability of running more frequently. As to the right type of music to ensure that your brain responds positively to running? That depends entirely on you.“It’s often to do with the personal associations that the music has for you,” says Hallett. “I had a participant who listened to music from their university days because it took them back to a time when they had less responsibility. Going on a run felt like a bit of escapism for them. Others were motivated by music that reminded them of people they knew. It depends what has meaning to you.”Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Citizens Advice estimates that a fifth of UK adults have applied or expect to apply for benefits as a result of coronavirus.Although 1 million recent claimants took out an advance loan from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to see them through the five-week wait, many had refused it, said Citizens Advice, because they would rather “scrape by” than go into debt.Sam Williams, a benefits specialist at Warrington Citizens Advice, said the five-week wait was a “real shock” to claimants: “You can sense them trying to do the mental maths on whether they can get by until their first payment and even then, if it will be enough for their essential bills and for them to put food on the table for their kids.“We talk people through their options, but taking an advance is something many feel nervous about. Instead I’ve seen people literally scraping by until their first payment: asking family and considering credit cards or other forms of credit from lenders missing bills and relying on food banks for support. It can put an enormous strain on people both financially and emotionally.”With many more people expected to claim universal credit as the government’s pandemic job retention scheme unwinds, the charity is calling on ministers to support claimants by temporarily turning advance loans into a non-repayable grant.Dame Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said:“Universal credit has been a hugely important safety net during this crisis, but it’s simply not right that some end up skipping meals, borrowing from family members or falling behind on bills while they wait for money to come through.“The government has said that it is too complicated to change the payment process for universal credit. Yet tackling this technical challenge is needed to reduce the human cost of the five-week wait.”A DWP spokesperson said: “With universal credit no one has to wait five weeks for money as urgent payments are available. We recognise this is a difficult time for people on low incomes and we’ve injected more than £6.5bn into the welfare system – including increasing universal credit by up to £1,040 a year – to help those in most need.“Repayments of advances\u0026nbspare made over 12 months and deductions are capped. More than 900,000 urgent payments have been made to claimants, landing in their accounts within days of a request, since mid-March.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1ae1995bbe3ab7aec20bb5788c53986ef4150e5/0_0_4332_2599/master/4332.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=baeb92c50336b3eee5ca00a6d39e4fe0","title":"chess national solving championship opens for entries from britain","story":"Entry is free, the prize fund is expected to be at least £1,200, and the winner qualifies for the 2021 world solving championship This week’s puzzle is the opening round of a national contest where  readers traditionally perform strongly.

There is life after Test Match Special. Henry Blofeld, recently back from the Real Marigold Hotel, is living proof of that, although the odds on Geoffrey Boycott following him on to that programme in the next series may be slim.Geoffrey will no longer be a regular on TMS, which is hardly surprising in this summer of all summers. He is in his 80th year and even he recognises that it is a good idea to shoulder arms to the pandemic. Like his old teammates, David Gower and Ian Botham, he is withdrawing – or has been quietly withdrawn – from the commentary box since he has not been offered another contract. The departure of an almighty trio of cricketers turned broadcasters marks the end of an era, in which Geoffrey, in contrast to his career on the pitch, played rather more shots than his former colleagues.My contact with Geoffrey s at least four decades – though we have never been particularly close. Even so I’ve admired his work throughout that time as a batsman especially and a broadcasterpundit. I played in the same team as him (on the field) once. In 1980, I was first selected in an England squad for two ODIs against the West Indies. As the net session on the eve of the first match at Headingley came to an end (where I would be 12th man) Geoffrey asked me to stay on and bowl to him I was more than happy to oblige. When he had finished batting he asked if I’d like him to bowl at me, an invitation I declined, but I was impressed that he had asked.I played in the second match at Lord’s, which England won by three wickets after chasing a target of 236. Geoffrey top-scored with 70. At the close of play the teams assembled on the balcony, where the man of the match award, which had been given to Boycott, would be announced. One problem: there was no Geoffrey. He was already on the train to Middlesborough, where Yorkshire were playing Sussex the following day. In one sense this was a highly professional act once out he could contribute no more and he wanted to be as fit and alert as possible when opening the batting for Yorkshire against Imran Khan and Garth le Roux. It was another reminder that here was a remarkably single-minded man.He was one of the two most treasured wickets among bowlers on the county circuit in that era (Viv Richards was the other one). I have not forgotten having him stumped by Trevor Gard at Weston-super-Mare (he wasn’t yards down the wicket he just lost his balance as the ball spun down the legside). He also remembers this well and still grimaces at the memory.He does not forget much and this has helped in his journalistic career. He has written many columns in his time and two of his longest-serving ghosts, John Etheridge of the Sun and Nick Hoult of the , make the same observation: he never forgets he is rock-solid reliable he will always be there at the arranged time he knows exactly what they want and he gives it to them. So more often than not their job has been one of transcribing rather than chiselling out a story.Likewise as a broadcaster Boycott was ultra-reliable he never missed his slot. Moreover, he recognised he was not being employed for his discretion. It would be a disappointment – and a surprise – to his employers and the majority of his listeners to hear Geoffrey start a sentence with “But on the other hand …”. One of his books is entitled The Corridor of Certainty.He has always been capable of sending a few shivers down the spine of his producer, when he sets off with a: “Don’t get me wrong they’re lovely people …” And he could be tricky to keep quiet Tony Cozier occasionally managed that by talking so fluently he would not let him in Matthew Hayden did this more spectacularly – and disrespectfully – at Edgbaston in 2009 on his first appearance in the TMS box, when suggesting on air that Boycott’s batting style had “emptied cricket grounds”, which prompted Geoffrey to throw down his microphone and storm off.The game has been his life batting was his obsession and the crease was his natural habitat, where he was at his most relaxed. But he soon became comfortable in a broadcasting box. It has always been fascinating to listen to him talking about the art of batting and to unpick how his cricketing brain was operating. I remember seeing the light once when Geoffrey was asked who he would prefer in his team, Shane Warne or Glenn McGrath. “You’ll pick Warne,” I said and we both understood why, which cheered me up since I was briefly on his wavelength. As Geoffrey explained: “They’re both brilliant bowlers but you might find someone who is almost a like-for-like replacement for McGrath Warne is unique.”Whenever he was wound up by Jonathan Agnew on TMS, he could eventually laugh at himself. The best sequence was over the venue of his 100th\u0026nbsphundred the bogus suggestion, delivered deadpan by Agnew and Andrew Samson, TMS’s scorer, was that this momentous event took place in Faisalabad rather than at Headingley against Australia in 1977 after a new ICC ruling, a source of considerable angst to Geoffrey, who had just commissioned some memorial plates to celebrate the 40th anniversary of this landmark.While some revelled in his bombast about Brexit, the honours system or uncovered wickets, I enjoyed chatting to him about his early days and was increasingly struck by the warmth and respect he showed when recalling some of his peers such as Brian Close and, in the end, Fred Trueman, with whom he had a few fierce arguments over the years, and his old opening partner for England, Bob Barber, who, he gratefully noted, “looked after me at the start”. Believe it or not, he has mellowed a bit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51edf197c298281543d23ab4bb87abc6de47699/0_47_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea34f47d13e0846aa75043c5df7b967","title":"twitter aims to limit people sharing articles they have not read","story":"Test to promote informed discussion will ask users if they want to retweet unread linksTwitter is trying to stop people from sharing articles they have not read, in an experiment the company hopes will “promote informed discussion” on social media.In the test, pushed to some users on Android devices, the company is introducing a prompt asking people if they really want to retweet a link that they have not tapped on.“Sharing an article can spark conversation, so you may want to read it before you tweet it,” Twitter said in a statement. “To help promote informed discussion, we’re testing a new prompt on Android – when you retweet an article that you haven’t opened on Twitter, we may ask if you’d like to open it first.”Twitter’s solution is not to ban such retweets, but to inject “friction” into the process, in order to try to nudge some users into rethinking their actions on the social network. It is an approach the company has been taking more frequently recently, in an attempt to improve “platform health” without facing accusations of censorship.In May, the company began experimenting with asking users to “revise” their replies if they were about to send tweets with “harmful language” to other people. “When things get heated, you may say things you don’t mean,” the company explained. “To let you rethink a reply, we’re running a limited experiment on iOS with a prompt that gives you the option to revise your reply before it’s published if it uses language that could be harmful.”That move has proved less effective, with the company’s filter picking up as much harmless – if foul-mouthed –\u0026nbspconversation between friends as it does genuinely hateful speech targeting others.“We’re trying to encourage people to rethink their behaviour and rethink their language before posting because they often are in the heat of the moment and they might say something they regret,” Twitter’s global head of site policy for trust and safety said at the time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ed93343eceb39068a4ff051743a66cafbecfa66/0_414_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acd25415be1dafc8d83dd30846ed8c0d","title":"dreams of italy readers travel tips","story":"A friendly football bar, the ‘real’ sword in the stone, plus walks, festivals and fantastic food ... you responded in droves to our request for Italian highlights For an unforgettable day away from the bustle of Rome, walk part of the Via Appia Antica, among the oldest paved roads in the world.

We stumbled upon a craft beer pub (the Alvarado Street) covered in football scarves from around the world. All the seats had names taped on them, reserved for friends and regulars – but a couple of drinks and phone calls by the barman later and we had our own bean bags in among it all.

TheoZip. Tent open: the Dolomites. We’d woken to those jagged spires for almost a week. This morning’s vista was across the green valley to the shark fin of the Sassolungo. Circling it was the aim for the day. An espresso on the piazza in Canazei was for fuel. Then we headed for the Col Rodella gondola. It’s a gateway to another world nearly 2,000 metres up, where rolling meadows crash into spires of rock, cows moo, and ramblers scuttle like ants across the trails. Thirteen hours of walking took us over the col and into the vast Alpe di Siusi, the largest alpine plateau in Europe. Tired legs were later rewarded with a wine (or 10) at the bustling Bar Oma, back in Canazei’s quaint centre.Joseph FrancisFour readers recommended this place this week! EdIn rural Marche, not far from the Adriatic coast, Casal dei Fichi (flats from €870 a week) is a glorious place. So beautiful and relaxing that we seldom travel far from its peaceful grounds, inviting pool and stunning views. We might make a quick trip or two to the local market and vineyard to ensure we are well stocked for our stay, and an occasional lunch in one of the huge choice of local restaurants. That said, for the more active there is a wide range of activitiestrips that can be enjoyed, and hosts Ian and Bob are on hand to advise and assist. We can’t wait for these lockdown days to end so that we can escape to this little piece of heaven. DiThe Abbey of San Galgano (adults €4) is a glorious ruin, but the real reason you are there is to enter the small round Rotonda chapel in the grounds, in which you will see the “real” Sword in the Stone, plunged into solid rock by the knight Galgano, attempting to deny the angels. The sword sits in a perspex dome, protection against thieves. The mummified arms of one would-be thief remain there as a warning. Then ponder the similarities to the Arthurian legends. Coincidence? Gord PaynterFresh out of uni I visited Reggio di Calabria, city of my forebears, over Ferragosto and had a transformative experience. In this beautiful city, free of tour buses and souvenir shops, I observed a way of life both foreign and completely sensible. Seemingly everyone spent their days taking it slow: extended families gathering at the beach, strolling about town, having long outdoor meals, rambling along the stunning yet understated promenade (pictured). Something clicked: it dawned on me that people live this way and I could too. Years later I briefly lived in Italy and hope to move back with my family.Nick PostorinoAs a kid I spent many family holidays in Camogli, near Genoa. The topography of steep mountains rising from the coast forced the locals to build upwards, creating a labyrinth of alleys and stairways. Of course the food was good, great gelato and pasta, and the famous pesto genovese. But what stands out is the focaccia. Recco, just north of Camogli, is the home of a most delicious cheesy version that has spread – like the molten cheese inside it – over the whole area. Popping into a focacceria to get a pile of freshly baked focaccia slices and sharing them was the highlight of the day.Simon HoerHead north from Trento and you reach a curious mix of Italian and German language and culture around Siusi allo Sciliar. Visit San Valentino’s church, then take the cable car to the Seiser Alm, one of Europe’s highest mountain plateaux, with 240km of tracks and trails great for running, walking or biking. It’s perfect in spring or autumn: try staying in one of the family-run farms that offer local knowledge, homegrown produce and a friendly welcome. Public transport is excellent, and if you need a hand on the hills and with the altitude, e-bike hire means you can manage without a car.Tony WadeAt the centre of the Valchiavenna, north of Lake Como, lies the old town of Chiavenna, on the right bank of the river Mera. From the railway station we walked the short distance to the magnificent nature park and wildlife refuge that is the Parco delle Marmitte dei Giganti. Taking its main path overlooking the river, we continued on our way in seclusion towards Prosto, with its ancient bridge and church. Crossing the bridge, the path leads to the beautiful Acquafraggia waterfalls, whose soothing roar was completely mesmerising. We stayed at the brilliant Villa Très Jolie (doubles from €95 B\u0026ampB).Robert ConnollyUp the road from San Gimignano is the equally picturesque medieval town of Volterra, but without the crowds of shuffling tourists – except for one weekend in August, when the town dresses up in its medieval finery and goes back in time. There are food stalls aplenty, musicians at every turn and pageantry to fill the eye. It is the best of Italy inasmuch as it is noisy and seemingly chaotic but enormous fun. It’s a great day out for a family or even a solo traveller. Modern currency is not accepted you have to change your euros into the historical equivalent and you then buy your street food with this. Confusingly, you then use euros if you stop for a drink or a coffee in a bar.Nick StringerWe were fortunate enough to discover a boating lake in a romantic corner of the Villa Borghese, a park in Rome. It was a haven from the long, hot queues of Rome’s tourist sites. We hired a boat. The joy of rowing around the small lake with the person I love is a pleasure I will never forget. The sound of a harp from a nearby musician beckoned us towards the Temple of Asclepius on a small island in the middle of the lake. The statues and fountains looked so alluring. We got so close that at one point we feared one of the fountains would draw us in and engulf our boat with water. We had to row a hasty retreat in laughter just before our time was called.RogerTrattoria Trapani on Piazza Giulio Cesare in Palermo reminded me of someone’s pantry. A young man and his father greeted us with smiles as large as mine and my mother’s hunger. To the left was the grandparents’ territory, the kitchen. We were given complimentary panelle (chickpea fritters), a local tradition. When we finished, the father came over and said, “I get you something from my farm.” He returned moments later with a complimentary plate of juicy blood orange slices. When paying I complimented the son’s English. He replied, “The Beatles. The best teachers, right?” Our no-frills Sicilian dream included plates of swordfish and spaghetti vongole for less than €7 a plate.Marth SnellingOne Saturday in June, we attended the annual Archidado Joust in Cortona. Attired in colourful medieval costumes, teams from Cortona, Arezzo and Subbiano perform elaborate flag-tossing routines, with cute displays by children, all accompanied by drummers and trumpeters. The celebration starts with a crossbow tournament, followed by a procession of worthies, drummers, trumpeters, and the teams into Cortona town square. For the next few hours, we witnessed a colourful and atmospheric pageant as each team performed with skill and precision. John HellinikakisWhile exploring the spectacular south coast of Sardinia, we detoured by ferry to the island of San Pietro, tempted by the annual Girotonno tuna fishing and cooking festival, held at the end of every May. The ferry docks in Carloforte, the picturesque main town. We soaked up the atmosphere, sampled tuna cooked a myriad of ways, watched tuna-themed cookery demonstrations, danced into the small hours at concerts in the main square, wandered its colourful streets and vowed to return.Marian O’Mahony"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a104afad75b8a8197746ddd1186ac568297e24c/0_21_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=abe7e1cdb70a1daad80acf9bcb8e7f3a","title":"beauty spot how do you make a tv show about looks without being shallow","story":"The makeover show is on the comeback trail, attempting to ditch the noughties cruelty that so defined it. But Queer Eye is one of the very few to succeedAs Queer Eye reaches its sixth season, its well received mission to put the self love in selfie has led to a resurgence in makeover shows, with a much-needed twist. Queer Eye is an empathetic tearjerker with its kinder approach to the genre, but the makeover shows that dominated the noughties were better known for their caustic putdowns.They were desperately cruel: the central premise of Snog, Marry, Avoid? was slut shaming, as well as essentially telling members of subcultures that they needed to be “normal” to gain acceptance. What Not To Wear saw Trinny and Susannah take scissors to the less-than-chic wardrobes of the public. Last year The Surjury offered a throwback to this period: a Channel 4 show that would have seen contestants attempt to convince a jury of 12 panellists that they were in need of plastic surgery. The backlash was huge, although it was ultimately pulled because of the sad death of its intended host, Caroline Flack.So what should a makeover show look like today? The rise of body positivity, female empowerment and self care means that jibes about double chins and crow’s feet don’t go down as well as they once did. And a greater push toward ersity means hosts and experts come in all shapes and sizes, and from all walks of life. But at times it simply feels like a syrupy veneer applied to what is largely the same product.The biggest change is not necessarily the ethos, but the tone. Hosts as harsh as Nicky Hambleton-Jones or Gillian McKeith have been replaced by those able to deliver similar messages, more delicately. BBC’s You Are What You Wear, which starts today, is fronted by the affable Rylan Clark-Neal, alongside a cohort of five erse stylists armed with compliments. Criticism is only ever light as the contestants wardrobes are reinvented.Embracing body positivity, one of the stylists specialises in dressing fuller figures. But much like modern “brand” feminism, there is an inherent cognitive dissonance in a show fixated on appearance while simultaneously trying to rubbish the idea that appearance matters at all. In the first episode we meet a PE teacher who lives in trackies and trainers because she finds them more comfortable. It’s hard to see why she needs a makeover at all.\u0026nbspHow To Look Good Naked, from 2006, returned to screens this year. Gok Wan’s Channel 4 show was always well ahead of its time, so hasn’t had to update much to work for a new generation of viewers. Its central message has always been normalising the female form, celebrating stretch marks and mum tums. But even Gok fell into the trap of suggesting shapewear to cover up bad bits that viewers had just been taught to flaunt.In today’s iteration we still see women’s bodies being paraded to the public in stunts. The opinion of strangers is still considered the barometer of worthiness. Though the comments are comparatively kind, we never quite shake the message that, bad or good, it’s what other people think about our appearance that matters most.Another rebooted franchise is 10 Years Younger, with a new home at Channel 5. It is hosted by the amiable Cherry Healey, but that isn’t enough to smooth its sharp edges. It’s hard not to wince when the British public bluntly weigh in on how old they think the women are and then watch them being delivered the news that they look a few years older as if they had terminal cancer. Even with likable, kindly hosts, these shows cannot help but veer into “hot or not” territory. Therein lies one of the biggest issues – how does one make a show entirely about looks, without being shallow?\u0026nbspQueer Eye, with the gang’s multi-pronged, in-depth approach to all areas of their participants’ lives, seems to be one of the few programmes that has managed to truly make over the makeover genre. Another, which began last year, is Drag SOS, which saw the drag queen collective The Family Gorgeous give men and women drag makeovers that boosted their confidence. Participants developed a drag persona and learned choreographed dance routines – along with bucketloads about themselves in the process – all leading up to a one-off performance.What’s clear is that it is not impossible to create makeover shows with heart, but many are still only willing to go skin deep.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f6281f41b1c55cd6b4536fbf56c542d38242332/3121_64_1223_734/master/1223.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f776ff5199303f8baf296e1371e5eae3","title":"from friday night lights to corrie our surprise lockdown tv gems","story":"Stuck at home, our writers’ viewing habits have extended to some unexpected small-screen discoveries, from old soaps and high school football to Bake Off for makeupOver these past 11 weeks of lockdown, I have become intimately familiar with the cracked white walls of my flat, stained by remnants of Blu Tack and decked with hastily pasted posters and photo frames. Like any committed TV watcher, the centre of my living space is my television –\u0026nbspthe welcome object of my focus away from plates piling up in the sink. Once I had rinsed through The Last Dance, Normal People, Tiger King and the rest, though, I found myself gravitating to an escapism of a different, more aesthetic kind.Alan Yentob’s Imagine series seems like a daunting undertaking at first glance: hour-long, ponderous documentaries on the biggest personalities in the arts, from Jeff Koons to Marlon Brando and Doris Lessing. It even stretches to the concept of the internet. There are three episodes from its 17-year archive currently on BBC iPlayer –\u0026nbspon Lenny Henry, Anish Kapoor and Howard Hodgkin – and they have become unexpected highlights of my current viewing.Yentob is a reassuringly calm presence, forever hunched and trailing behind his interviewees, asking suitably vague questions about the meaning and allure of works, while glimpses of Kapoor’s luridly bright sculptures, Henry’s booming laugh, and Hodgkin’s swirling colourscapes have provided much-needed reminders of all the vibrant creativity that exists around us. Hopefully, it is something we will be able to enjoy for real again once we emerge back into some semblance of normality.\u0026nbspIf nothing else, the programmes have at least inspired me to decorate my flat a little better. Ammar KaliaWhenever I hear tech bros talk on TV shows, the phrase “hacking the mainframe” starts running ticker-tape-style through my brain, drowning out all the actual dialogue. Which is why Devs (BBC iPlayerFX) – the Silicon Valley-set thriller from Alex Garland (The Beach, Ex Machina) – wasn’t exactly something I was prepared to clear my schedule for. What I was willing to do was vaguely overhear bits of it as my partner watched in the proper manner – a style of viewing that meant it took an inordinately long time for me to realise that Devs is less about big computers and more about the big questions.What begins as a whodunnit set amid the shadowy goings-on at Amaya, a technology firm led by a Charles Manson lookalike called Forest (Parks and Rec’s Nick Offerman), swiftly morphs into a) a rough guide to quantum physics, and b) a discussion of determinism so involving it will recolour your entire worldview. Devs does for free will what Inception did for lucid dreaming and The Truman Show did for your life being a morally dubious reality-TV experiment.It may have taken me a while to get on board, but I won’t forget this stylish, heartrending and compelling show in a hurry. Rachel AroestiWith lockdown shutting down soap filming and the nation’s favourite serials reduced to a few showings a week, I have found a solution: watching old soap episodes on BritBox. Thanks to the service’s archive system, I’m\u0026nbspreliving a plane destroying Emmerdale, seeing Den hand Angie orce papers on Christmas Day, and crying:\u0026nbsp“Free the Weatherfield One!”If you had asked me six months ago if I would be spending a global pandemic rewatching old episodes of Coronation Street – I’d say yes, that sounds exactly like something I would do, where can I see them?BritBox has been criticised for essentially being no more than a repeats service, but this is why the soap archive works so well. Unlike every other programme that gets frequently reshown, soaps are one-offs, producing some of the biggest moments on British TV, never be shown again.\u0026nbspRichard Hillman driving the Platts into the canal\u0026nbspisn’t the sort of thing made to only be watched once.\u0026nbspMy only complaint is that the EastEnders archive is worryingly sparse. Where is the Max and Stacey videotape reveal, or Sharongate’?\u0026nbspDon’t hold out on me now, BBC.\u0026nbspFrances RyanStrong is tawdry, bewildering and, in its explicit association between body confidence and traversing monkey bars under the tutelage of a man called Todd or Ky, guilty of setting unrealistic wellness goals. But it’s addictive, and is now a key part of my regime. Jack SealeThere were signs, I suppose. An (entirely healthy) obsession with Drag Race. An (entirely unhealthy) obsession with Skin Wars and its bizarre world of competitive body painting. But eight weeks ago I would have been more inclined to believe that driving 30 miles with your child in the back of your car was a government-approved eye test than I would that I’d have binged an entire series of Glow Up: Britain’s Next Make-Up Star (iPlayer) in a few days. And yet, here we are. Lockdown does strange things to a person. BBC Three’s take on the Bake Off formula swaps cakes for elaborate makeup, and presents a varied cast of young British talent. What they can do with clay and some eyeliner is astonishing, and some of the transformations are jaw dropping – as far out of what you might see on the high street as my choux buns are from Paul Hollywood’s finest croque-en-bouche.It is lovely to see our oft-demonised “youth” perform at such a high level, and while the judges have some annoying foibles (Dear God, Val Garland, please stop trying to make “Ding, dong” happen) they are enthused by strong performances, and quick to encourage these young people to grow their talent. Stacey Dooley excels as host, one part friendly older sister, one part everybody’s favourite teacher. Refreshingly, the prize isn’t £10k and a pat on the back. Instead, the winner gets a contract to learn and assist some of the world’s best makeup artists so that they, too, can build a future in the industry. Toby MosesI’ve never belonged to a sports team. At school, I was always the last to get picked in PE. “She appears to be afraid of the ball,” was one school report’s verdict on my netball performance. So it’s safe to say that a drama about the triumphs, trials and tribulations of a Texas high school football team didn’t immediately appeal.But I had heard so many good things about Friday Night Lights (Amazon) that I decided to give it a go. And my oh my, it’s the best choice I’ve made all lockdown. It’s a brilliant combination of emotional rollercoaster and profound social commentary on the racism, deprivation and religious conservatism that are endemic in the US south. I have never cared about TV characters like I’ve cared about the folk of Dillon, Texas – and that’s only partly because I’ve been hanging out with them more than with my mates. As a motto to live by, you can’t do better than: “What would Coach T do?” To have a marriage like his and Tami’s has to be the ultimate relationship goal.I’m so obsessed that I couldn’t help but feel sad thinking how gutted the Panthers team would have been had the season been called off because of coronavirus, and I find the thought of it being over so horrifying that I’m saving the last eight episodes, maybe for ever. When I feel the lockdown blues approaching, I look in the mirror and give myself a little pep talk: “Clear eyes, full hearts, CAN’T LOSE!” Sonia SodhaRemember waking up far too early, heading out into the still-dark morning, getting into an Uber or on to a train, and starting your holiday? Remember changing time zones? Remember scrambling across continents by any means necessary, battling floods in China and working on a ranch in Argentina, only the cost of an airfare in your pocket? Oh, you don’t remember that last bit?\u0026nbspIf you have watched BBC Two’s Race Across the World (iPlayer), it might sound familiar, however. Following pairs of friends and families from across Britain, all of whom have undergone or are undergoing some kind of life change or challenge, the show does the logical thing and sends them thousands of miles away from their homes and support systems to race against one another.\u0026nbspIt is not the type of show I would usually watch, mostly because I’ve never been backpacking, and the last time I ran was in 2001 at a school sports day. However, its cross-continental journeys felt like just the thing for lockdown. And, as well as being thrilling in an extended school geography lesson sort of way, it’s rather heartwarming, too. The star of the second series was Jo, who should just be everyone’s mum from now on, while the first featured two friends I was desperate to go for a beer with (Natalie and Shameema, let me know when you’re free?).\u0026nbspSo, get your backpack ready, head out of the door at silly o’clock ... and then come straight back in, plonk yourself on the sofa and have a watch.

But interviews with experts, and analysis of the government’s own data, paint a grim picture of what the UK has endured – and a lack of confidence about what the next 12 weeks may hold.First glance at the now-familiar government graphs suggest the curves tracking new infections and deaths are showing significant improvements, at least when viewed from the devastating peak of the outbreak around Easter, when new infections hit 3,918 on 5 April and deaths peaked at 943 a day on 11 April, taking rolling averages.\u0026nbspCloser inspection reveals a less comforting picture. When Johnson spoke 12 weeks ago there were 913 new cases of coronavirus recorded each day on average. At the latest count there were 1,543.Twelve weeks ago the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths was just 21 this week it remains 10 times higher. As the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, reminded Johnson in parliament on Wednesday, the UK’s excess deaths during the pandemic have passed 63,000 – higher than in Italy, Spain and France. As Greece (with a death toll of 183) welcomes holidaymakers, Britons still cannot stay overnight with extended family in most cases.Scientists are also concerned that as lockdown lifts, the test, trace and isolate system for quelling future outbreaks is not robust enough. The care sector, where at least 15,000 have died from Covid-19 so far, warns that the government’s tactics to protect the most vulnerable in a second wave remain largely unchanged.It is the sheer numbers of infections and deaths at the peak that have shocked many. Two days before Johnson made his prediction, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said less than 20,000 deaths would be “a good outcome”.That milestone was passed more than six weeks ago. According to Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser and now chairman of an independent version of the government’s Sage advisory group, that could have been the total death toll.King has calculated that if Johnson had ordered the lockdown on the day he promised to “turn the tide”, rather than four days later, transmission would have been slashed and fatalities halved. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist and former government adviser, also said on Wednesday that the death toll could have been halved if lockdown had come a week earlier.We have not “sent coronavirus packing”, King says, because the R factor – the rate of reproduction – is still not low enough. His group is worried we are risking a second wave by lifting lockdown restrictions now.“There has been a series of really dreadful mistakes by this government that has led to a vast number of people dying and they need not have died,” he said.His calculation about an earlier lockdown was supported by Prof Roland Kao, chair of epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh. He found that if Scotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier, its death toll could have been cut to a fifth of the country’s 4,000 deaths now linked to the disease.\u0026nbsp“Cutting the virus off earlier has a huge benefit,” said Kao, who warned the tail of the epidemic is likely to be unpredictable and long.Some modellers predict more grief to come even in this first wave. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington DC, for example, believes the UK could suffer another 3,500 Covid deaths by 4 August.Critics say the tide has not turned in other ways too. The government’s test, trace and isolate system remains “not even close” to being able to keep up with new infections, said King. Care homes complain about a continued lack of testing to control outbreaks which can spread through asymptomatic staff and residents.“We need much clearer protocols on planning for a second wave and they need to make their plans public,” said Martin Green, chief executive of the industry group Care England. “We need either weekly or fortnightly testing.”Care minister Helen Whately said on Tuesday she is expecting scientific advice soon on the appropriate frequency of repeat testing. Some care managers now want ministers to use hospitals to quarantine infected residents in future outbreaks, as happened in Hong Kong where no one has died from Covid-19 in a care home.“In any assessment of turning the tide you have to include preparedness and clarity of action against Covid,” said Dan Hayes, chief executive of the Order of St John Care Trust, which runs 82 care homes and accommodation centres where 242 residents died from Covid-19. “We still don’t have certainty about care residents being able to access hospital treatment on the same basis as everyone else. There is still a viewpoint that people in care homes will not benefit from treatment.”The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the government’s “Protect the NHS” mantra had obscured other important aims.“The prime minister had all this rhetoric about turning tides, and taking things on the chin,” he said. “Twelve weeks later, we have one of the highest excess death rates in the world. And yes, the NHS has coped: but it’s coped on the back of discharging its patients into care homes cancelling operations delaying treatments for cancer – which probably means we’ll have waiting lists at 10m by Christmas.”Downing Street, by contrast, takes a very different view of its performance – and the outlook for the future.Referring to Covid-19 as “an invisible mugger”, Johnson claimed in the House of Commons on Wednesday that it had been an “astonishing achievement” to “drive down the curve”.Asked about whether the country had “turned the tide”, his spokesperson added: “Thanks to the very hard work of the British public we have now passed through the peak and you are seeing the key indicators like the new hospital admissions, new infections and the number of deaths falling. But at the same time we know we have much, much more to do in order to both beat this virus and put the country fully on the road to recovery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee79db233601f7a6674588593421140b52a1ca6f/0_386_5790_3474/master/5790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80eec430c3895a6537a2a98aefa15850","title":"internet ban sparks covid 19 rumours in rohingya camp","story":"Call for Bangladesh to lift news blackout as refugees who fled Burma try to flee againRohingya leaders have urged Bangladesh to lift an internet ban imposed on a million refugees in the city of Cox’s Bazar, warning that rumours and panic over Covid-19 is deterring people from getting tested.Limits on communication are exacerbating already dire conditions for the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, who live in cramped bamboo huts with as many as eight family members to a room, and are dependent on communal taps and toilets. In some areas, basics such as soap are lacking.Aid agencies in the city in south-east Bangladesh, 20 miles from the border with Myanmar, have warned repeatedly that the virus could thrive in the camps and that medical facilities would be unable to cope. As of 10 June, 35 refugees have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization, while three have died. In total, 30 are in quarantine, though it is feared that there are more undetected cases.The outbreak has coincided with flu season, adding to confusion over symptoms, but community members say that people are avoiding going to clinics because they are worried about being moved to isolation facilities.Last week, two people fled quarantine because they believed they would be sent to centres far from their families, according to reports.Many of the Rohingya refugees sheltering in Cox’s Bazar fled to Bangladesh in 2017, following a military crackdown in Myanmar on its minority Muslim population, which the UN has since said was carried out with “genocidal intent”.\u0026nbspAfter three years in the camps, with people unable to access education or build livelihoods, conditions have become increasingly desperate. Since the start of the year, many have attempted to flee Cox’s Bazar by embarking on dangerous boat journeys to Malaysia, 1,000 miles away. They have then been left stranded at sea for months as countries respond to the coronavirus pandemic by tightening their borders.\u0026nbspThis week, 270 refugees were detained by Malaysia after their damaged trawler was intercepted by the country’s coastguard.Separately, another boat carrying hundreds of refugees from Cox’s Bazar was recently intercepted by Bangladesh and escorted to Bhasan Char, a remote silt island, apparently to reduce the risk of bringing the virus into Cox’s Bazar. Some refugees fear they could face the same fate, though the UN’s refugee agency said that 200 beds in severe respiratory infection isolation and treatment centres were available, and that hundreds more were being established.Mohammad Shaiful, 25, who lives with his wife, uncle and one-year-old daughter, said misinformation spread quickly in the camp. “There’s a rumour that people will be killed in quarantine,” he explained. “Like doctors are injecting them with something that’s causing the deaths. Also, doctors are ‘giving’ coronavirus to people who don’t even have it and killing them.\u0026nbspPeople tend to believe those rumours rather than putting some sense into it.”\u0026nbspRefugees are being urged to maintain good hygiene and physical distancing but at the same time aid work has been cut to reduce the risk of transmission. Though essential services such as food and sanitation are continuing, one community leader said that in his area toilets had become unusable because they were not being maintained.\u0026nbsp“Honestly, we are not practising hand washing and maintaining sanitation because the particular NGOs who are responsible for hand washing and hygiene and sanitation, they are not coming in the camp,” said Mohammad Jaffa, a community leader in camp 7 of Cox’s Bazar.Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, said that the Rohingya were grateful to Bangladesh for hosting them in Cox’s Bazar, but that internet services should be switched on so that people could receive news and reliable information about the pandemic.“They can’t follow what’s happening in the world and how many people have died. They need to know what is happening with Covid-19 so they can learn from that and see how it is a danger to the whole community,” he said.\u0026nbspThe Bangladeshi government has repeatedly stated that it is doing far more than other countries to support the Rohingya, and says that the internet ban has been imposed for security reasons.Markets and shops were closed, said Abu Tahir, 37, who lives with his wife and three children, but people could not stay isolated inside tiny rooms all day.“I don’t know what will happen if I test positive for Covid. “I’m not so sure about this quarantine thing. If anything’s to happen to me, I’d like to have my children and loved ones around me. And they say there’s no treatment for this disease, then what’s the point of isolating?“We’ve already been through a lot. But we survived because the Almighty has a soft corner for us. He’ll take care of us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1c3c08bc27b6eb2ea3c16f41196d2bb09f4578/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd048dacb806c54dcb4473070fd5a126","title":"paul mccartney italy ticket refund policy singer government gigs","story":"Singer says government decree preventing refunds for cancelled gigs is ‘insult to fans’Sir Paul McCartney has strongly criticised the Italian government over an “outrageous” decree preventing concertgoers from getting refunds on gigs that were cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic.The former Beatle had been due to perform in Naples on Tuesday and in Lucca on Saturday as part of his Freshen Up tour.He wrote on Facebook that when his shows across Europe were cancelled on 7 May, it was in the belief that fans would receive a refund. While this was the case in the other countries the singer had been scheduled to visit, a decree passed by the Italian government offered only vouchers for scrapped music events.“It is outrageous that those who have paid for their tickets are not getting their money back,” McCartney wrote. “Without the fans there would be no live entertainment. We strongly disagree with what the Italian government are doing … the organiser of our shows must do the right thing here.“We are all extremely disappointed the shows could not take place and this is a real insult to the fans.”The decree was passed under the recommendation of Assomusica, an Italian live music promoter, with vouchers valid for 18 months.D’Alessandro \u0026amp Galli, the agency that promoted McCartney’s concerts in Italy, said the singer had been aware of the voucher plan before the gigs were cancelled.“We fully understand the artist’s bitterness as he cared for these two concerts that would have marked his return to Italy, as well as the displeasure of fans for receiving a voucher instead of a full refund,” the company said.“The formula was established by the Italian government to deal with an unprecedented crisis that risked giving a fatal blow to the live music industry and the approximately 400,000 workers who risk not being able to work for a year.”Dario Franceschini, the culture minister, said the intention was for vouchers to be used for gigs held by the same artist. If no future dates were set, then people would be entitled to a refund.“I’m sure parliament will be able to intervene to remove any interpretative doubt on the rule,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The effects of climate change could damage, and possibly even destroy, our collective heritageAgriculture Minister accuses Green party leader of doing a \u0026lsquodisservice\u0026rsquo to rural communities"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Above, protective face masks at a clothing stall in Norwich, in the UK. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergGo into any supermarketshop, or take any form of public transport in Ireland, and it is clear few people are wearing face masks. It is hard to resist the conclusion that either they are utterly confused by changing public health messaging, or they don’t see the merit of wearing a mask. Those in the latter camp may believe this Covid-19 pandemic is dealt with as Irish deaths and cases are close to zero – and wish to get back to normal as quickly as possible. Or they are not prepared to put up with what they perceive as the hassle of wearing a mask with all the protocols about how to put it on and take it off correctly, not forgetting re-use procedure. There is social stigma too around wearing them.While the world for the most part agreed on the best way to deal with the Covid-19, ie lockdown, physical distancing and repeated handwashing, the same cannot be said about face masks. There is huge variation between countries in some they are mandatory in public places, in others they are worn routinely whenever there is risk of an epidemic. Differing advice from health authorities doesn’t help.A lot comes down to interpreting research, evaluating risk and factoring human behaviour. So scientists don’t reach an absolute position and governments wrestle with what to tell their citizens who are demanding clarity.What on balance is best advice?Advice on whether to wear a mask has changed in line with emerging research about Covid-19. Evidence backing the wearing of masks in public, where there is community transmission, has strengthened – especially in confined spaces. They do not need to be worn in the open air or while driving a car.When it comes to those over 60, whose immune system is weakening coinciding with ageing, and those with underlying conditions, the case is clear-cut. Moreover, this age group should wear medical-grade masks that, fortunately, are now more readily available, though not cheap.What is the latest advice from the World Health Organisation?In the past week, WHO has come out more strongly in favour of masks, with a variation of types recommended depending on circumstances. Its updated guidance says the public should wear masks where physical distancing is not possible. It is firmly in favour of medical masks for the over-60s and those with pre-existing conditions. A cloth mask of at least three layers is best for the general public. Initially, the WHO was almost anti-mask, insisting many people won’t wear masks properly, thereby risking infection. Masks give people a false sense of security and encourage risky behaviour, it contended. Compounding matters was the obvious shortage of masks for healthcare workers as cases rose rapidly. WHO accepts growing indications that the more people use masks, the lower the transmission, notably from those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. Previously it recommended masks for people who are symptomatic, to prevent spread to others.What research is persuasive in favour of face masks?At the onset, scientific evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in slowing transmission of respiratory diseases was limited. There was no data on Covid-19 since it was a previously unknown disease.However, there is a growing body of evidence favouring face masks and cloth coverings. This week a UK study found population-wide face mask use could push Covid-19 transmission down to controllable levels, and prevent further waves of the virus when combined with minor lockdowns. A US study found that if 80 per cent of a closed population were to don a mask, infection rates would statistically drop to approximately one-twelfth the number of infections – compared to “a live-virus population” in which no one wore masks.Where does Ireland stand in light of revised WHO guidance?NPHET’s expert advisory group is to review the latest WHO recommendations, but evaluation of current advice suggests Ireland is very much aligned with that viewpoint – though there may be a difference of emphasis.The bottom line, however, is mask use is nowhere near the level warranted. There has been a failure of national advice to hit the target – understandable at a time of exponential rise in cases less acceptable when easing lockdown.Given such low usage in Ireland, the time has come to heed the strong recommendation of WHO special envoy Dr David Nabarro, who told the Oireachtas special committee on Covid-19 there needed to be a push from saying people “should” wear them to people “must” wear them.This, he advised, was for the benefit of service providers, including drivers, attendants and security guards – it was a reasonable requirement that commuters wear coverings for the sake of people who look after them.There is much catching up to do to ensure more specialist masks are available for those who are vulnerable to Covid-19 and those who cannot afford a mask or to make a cloth version. Supplying free masks to every household could make up lost ground.What is the prudent way to proceed?There is no going back to normal soon. Risk of contamination of surfaces and infection is ever present. Good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, while maintaining physical distancing where possible is still the winning formula. But “wear a mask” in the correct way has rightly been added to that mix.

In a press briefing on Thursday, Liz Canavan, assistant secretary-general of the Department of An Taoiseach, said that the changes to include these women have now been made, making them eligible for the scheme.“Revenue has also confirmed that the changes in place of the wage subsidy scheme are now in place to accommodate employees who have returned or are due to return to work following a period of maternity leave, adopted leave or related unpaid leave,” Ms Canavan said.“These changes also apply to employees who were not on their employer’s payroll on the 29th of February, who were on a period of paternity, parental or related unpaid leave, or in receipt of health and safety benefit, parents benefit or illness benefit.”Employers who wish to access this scheme on behalf of employees covered by these changes can do so by completing a short online form, available for download via Revenue’s online service, Ms Canavan added.Employers of workers who have been in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) may also be eligible for the TWSS, if the employee has been rehired.“The employee needs to cease their PUP payment claim and the employer can provide relevant information to Revenue,” she said.Over 60,000 employers are registered with Revenue for the temporary wage subsidy scheme, and more than 527,300 employees have now received at least one payment under the scheme. However, that figure does not include additional employees who may receive a subsidy as a result of payments generated on Thursday, on which Revenue generated further payments to employers of € 26 million. These payments will be in the bank accounts of “the majority” of the respective employers tomorrow. The value of payments made to employers under the scheme now stands at €1.48 billion, Ms Canavan said.Speaking about face coverings, the assistant sectretary-general said the Government is “aware” of the public’s concern and confusion on when to wear them.She added the National Public Health and Emergency Team will meet on Thursday to discuss face coverings, taking the World Health Organization’s new guidelines on coverings into consideration.Ms Canavan also added that non-covid related health services are resuming, adding they “can see a return to non-Covid levels of services in emergency departments and in hospitals overall”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275979.1591821419!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"changes to farming a sticking point in government talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Agriculture Michael Creed. Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA Talks will continue on the formation of a government on Thursday with progress reported on several issues on Wednesday, but no sign yet of a decisive breakthrough.Sources now fear the talks could run into the weekend, despite the belief in all parties that this week represented a final deadline to reach agreement.One source reported significant progress on Wednesday with agreement on a text covering a number of policy areas in a proposed programme for government, but added that this was on less contentious issues. The role of agriculture in reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains a key sticking point, with isions between the Green Party and Fine Gael on the issue demonstrated on Wednesday when Green leader Eamon Ryan and Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed clashed during a Dáil debate.Sources said all parties knew the “landing zone” for agreement is for average annual reductions to be about 7 per cent, but that there would not be complete clarity about how that would achieved in the later years of a five-year term. One Green source acknowledged it would not be possible to have a detailed roadmap for the reductions in emissions every year, and the Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton referenced the example in the Dáil of Denmark – a country specifically identified as a role model in the Green manifesto. “The reality is that we will probably end up in a position like Denmark, which has committed to high ambition but cannot specify all of the pathway,” he said. “That is the reality we will have to follow.”If negotiating teams and the deputy leaders agree the bulk of a text on Thursday or Friday, the remaining issues will be “kicked upstairs” to the party leaders to agree. Green agreementFine Gael and Fianna Fáil doubt that Green deputy leader Catherine Martin will agree a final text approved by the leaders, but Ms Martin has told her party she wants to get a deal that will gain the two-thirds support it needs among Green members. Meanwhile, Rise TD Paul Murphy sought to stoke Green Party fears that it will be attacked from the left after a deal. Mr Murphy said the Greens would be a “mudguard” for “neo-liberal and austerity policies” if they agree to share power.He said the Greens will be blamed for every “austerity” measure under the guise of it being “about the environment”.Mr Ryan said he “fundamentally disagrees” with claims his party will be bad for farmers, as Mr Creed accused him of doing a “disservice” to farmers over their efforts on bioersity.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said he has been in touch with Mr Ryan to tell him that his party still wants to form a government and will attempt to do so if the current talks are unsuccessful.“We’ve made sure we have been in contact over the last number of days,” Mr Doherty said. “We have reassured people we want to be part of a government for change.”“It is important that the Greens know there are other options.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4276566.1591876894!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says ireland may be almost fully open by mid july","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach  Leo Varadkar said some restrictions would have to continue including a ban on mass gatherings.

He stressed that the Government’s plan was suppression not mitigation.Mr Varadkar said it indicates that easing of restrictions could continue and the Government is now conducting extensive work with NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) about speeding up phase three and four and “have the country almost fully open by the middle of July rather than the middle of August”.But he said some restrictions would have to continue including a ban on mass gatherings.“It all depends on us continuing to keep the virus under control,” but he added that “the last couple of days have been encouraging” notwithstanding the deaths in that time.Referring to childcare services he said they could re-open from June 29th. The Taoiseach acknowledged that the vast majority of crèches closed for July and August but “we would anticipate that those that usually open for summer months will re-open”.Mr Varadkar also echoed

post-Brexit transition period. Photograph: Andrew TestaNew York TimesBritain wants to accelerate the pace of its negotiations with the European Union by changing the format of the talks, a cabinet office minister told MPs on Tuesday. Paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any agreement must be in place before the end of the year so that businesses would have time to adapt to its terms.“There is no point in our arriving at an agreement at the 11th hour: we have to arrive at an agreement to enable it to be implemented and ratified, but also in order for our citizens and businesses to prepare. That is what is dictating the timetable, and that is why we must have renewed focus. We are talking to the EU about having a change of format – about how we can increase the pace of negotiations, get the focus where we need it to be, and get a deal done for both our sakes,” she said.‘Achingly pragmatic’Ms Mordaunt said the government would soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. But she declined to give details and said officials were planning for all outcomes, including the possibility that no deal would be agreed.“It would be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario, just as we have always done. We did so last year and then did not need to implement those preparations. I am confident that we cannot only come to an agreement but do so in a timeframe that gives people the time that they need to prepare and to understand. We are very aware of the other things that are going on in the world that form the backdrop to that. Our approach is going to be achingly pragmatic,” she said.Transition periodFormer Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said that businesses in the North had told him they were moving jobs to the Republic because of the implications of the Northern Ireland protocol. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna drew the minister’s attention to last week’s vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly calling for an extension to the transition period.“The government insisted that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have the final say on the protocol. The Assembly finally gave a say on Brexit when it voted last week to request an extension to the transition period to allow businesses, which are currently in the fight of their lives due to Covid, to adapt and to have the certainty that the minister refers to. If the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consent is so vital, should the government not listen to what it says?” she said.Ms Mordaunt said that, although the Assembly would determine whether the terms of the protocol remain in force in a few years’ time, the government would not extend the transition.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

In the real world, wake-up call after wake-up call rang with grisly lucidity, while Britain remained trapped in its obsessive-compulsive second wave bunker. First came the warnings of a jobsageddon, as unemployment claims surged by 70 per cent. Then the news that NHS waiting lists are set to double to 10 million. This rounded off by Rishi Sunak’s revelation that school closures will wreck the UK more than the 2008 crash.But on Planet Lockdown, even these grimmest of facts could not penetrate the powerful forcefield of Covid hysteria. So much so that No 10 has ditched plans to reopen primary schools, overwhelmed and intimidated by the strange new “safety first” neurosis sweeping through the public sector. At this crucial juncture that will decide Britain’s economic future, the nation is incapable of having a sensible lockdown debate.But perhaps this is no surprise, when virus modelling zealots continue to conflate, confuse and corrupt the scientific discussion. After playing a starring role in what may go down in history as the most seismic scientific error ever, Imperial College on Monday released a deeply odd paper, with a cunningly worded press release, claiming that “lockdown and school closures in Europe may have prevented 3.1 million deaths”.The hitch is that this impressive figure comes from comparing the actual death toll with the death toll in an imaginary counter-factual universe that could never have existed. The report appears to make the literally inhuman assumption that, if there had been no government measures imposed, not one person would have changed their behaviour in response to the virus– even though mobility data suggests mobility was falling before lockdown. It also assumes that in this parallel universe, 70 per cent of people would get the virus to reach herd immunity.This despite emerging evidence that calls such thinking into question, or at least complicates it significantly. The La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California has, for example, tested pre-Covid 19 blood samples and found that many have so-called “T cell reactivity” (a form of immunity) to the virus, even though they have never been exposed to it (but had almost certainly been exposed to at least three of the four common cold coronaviruses). They tentatively posit that such “cross-reactive immunity” could offer some people natural protection from Covid-19, which means that a great many people may have natural protection, making the herd immunity threshold potentially much lower.Could it be that burrowing down too deeply into the latest evidence risks rocking the foundations of lockdown? Other researchers have had no such qualms, revising their assumptions based on new information as it comes in rather than retreating to tired old models. The University of Oxford has, for example, just published research that explores what respiratory infection logs up to May might tell us about Covid in the community. This granular, evidence-led approach suggests that the infection rate fell significantly from March 15, long before lockdown orders were imposed.But the momentum somehow seems against them. From the study into the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where only 19 per cent of people were infected despite ideal spreading conditions – which could suggest widespread natural immunity – to early evidence of superspreaders in China and Italy, insights that challenge pro-lockdown assumptions have been sidelined from the start.And in an infuriating twist, a lot of very good modelling is going on in the margins. Neuroscientist Karl Friston, whose generative modelling, which is more responsive to uncertainties and adjusts assumptions as data flows in, is digging into whether natural immunity could explain Germany’s comparatively low fatality rate. Nobel prize-winner Michael Levitt has found that Covid has seemingly followed a so-called Sigmoid curve across the world, with exponential growth slowing after two weeks (rather than the virus continuously growing exponentially as assumed by Imperial).Mathematical research company Omega Analysis has compellingly predicted the daily increases in new cases in several countries using cutting-edge statistical methods. But this, alas, is a side story. Years from now historians will write books about how a mickey mouse discipline crept across Western universities like a cancer, spawning new fields (like climate modelling), and corrupting old ones (like epidemiology). Indeed, one of the most bizarre spectacles of this whole debacle has been to watch some modellers justify their murky findings by talking up fundamental epidemiological theory, as if it is the new physics.It cannot be a coincidence that, as the scientists refuse to engage with the real world, so too do the wider public. Life imitates art, so the merry cliche goes. But one might fear that Covid will give rise to a chilling new saying: life imitates science.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"harry enfield have no regrets blackface","story":"Harry Enfield has defended his use of blackface, saying he would like the opportunity to impersonate Rishi Sunak.The veteran comedian said he had no regrets about blacking up to play Nelson Mandela, in a sketch that portrayed him as a drug dealer.In a discussion on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Enfield, 59, said: “I played Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron - four Prime Ministers.“If Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister I would find it difficult that I would not be allowed to play him because of the colour of his skin.”Enfield said he had blacked up several times in the past. “I played Nelson Mandela in one thing for laughs - and I did it because this thing had come round from the BBC that we couldn’t do it any more.“And so I thought, well, who is my hero? Nelson Mandela, who I had the pleasure of meeting once. And what’s the stereotype of black people? At the time there were a lot of things in the paper about drugs, so I made him a drug dealer or peddler of alcopops to children and things like that, which I thought was so wrong that it was right.“I wouldn’t do it now but I don’t think I regret it.”Enfield said he had also played an Indian officer in the First World War for a BBC Two history programme. “I just read a book on the Indian regiments in the First World War and I wanted to represent them, so I did a chap who talked like Zia ul-Haq, the old Pakistani dictator who was educated at Sandhurst.“So you can judge whether they’re funny or not but I definitely think there should still be a conversation about it.”Enfield debated the issue with Ava Vidal, comedian and writer. At one stage he referred to the Chocolate Coloured C--n, a character played in the 1930s by GH Elliott.The Today programme’s presenter, Nick Robinson, said some people would be offended by that term and advised Enfield not to repeat it.Vidal said blackface was unacceptable. “You have to look at the origins of blackface: it was done for the entertainment of white people, and done promoting negative stereotypes. It normalises dehumanisation.”She added: “I’m sure you can take the mickey out of the Prime Minister without blacking up, if he was a black Prime Minister.”The pair were debating the issue after the BBC and Netflix took down old episodes of Little Britain featuring blackface characters, saying “times have changed”.Yesterday, Ant and Dec issued a public apology for impersonating black people in the undercover segment of their Saturday Night Takeaway show several years ago.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"homeschooling gardens uks haves have nots have had different","story":"Ever since the UK was put under lockdown we have been assured we are all in it together, and only an immense national effort can defeat the virus.But in reality, life under lockdown has been a wildly different experience depending on income and personal circumstances, statistics from a range of sources suggest.From access to outside space to the practicalities of homeschooling and the ability of people in different professions to work from home, there are stark disparities.Often, it is the poorest in society who get the short end of the stick in these regards and with aspects of lockdown - including lack of school openings - looking set to continue indefinitely the personal cost of lockdown keeps rising.Primary school children have been doing an average of 5.1 hours of learning time at home during lockdown according to a survey by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.This includes online classes provided by the school, any other work set by the school, time with paid private tutors and a catch-all category of other educational activities.However, the amount of time children spend doing these things varies by their household income with those in the poorest quintile doing 90 minutes less per day than those in the most well off quintile.This would add up to a gap of three weeks of schoolwork if this pattern continued until September - at which point some schools may still not be open.This ide in learning time is greatly impacted by the amount of resources that schools provide their pupils, with the biggest ides coming in avenues of intensive online help.For example, just 41 per cent of the poorest state secondary school pupils pupils say their schools are providing them with online classes, compared with 58 per cent of the richest pupils.Private school pupils are well out in front in this regard with 79 per cent saying they have access to online lessons and 48 per cent saying that online video chats are available.For more than 11 weeks now, hundreds of thousands of workers have been working remotely as offices the length and breadth of the country have shut up shop - likely to be the last to reopen.The advantages of home working are clear - less at risk of catching or spreading infection, saving on commuting costs, and having more time with family and friends.But the lockdown experience rests heavily on how much you earn and where you live.For many occupations, home working simply isn\u0027t an option.Among elementary occupations - including cleaners and labourers - working from home is often impossible.According to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, fewer than one in 20 in elementary occupations had ever worked from home prior to December 2019.Higher earners were overwhelmingly more likely to have been able to work from home. Of those in managerial and professional occupations - with average gross incomes above £800 a week - more than 40 per cent had been able to work from home before the pandemic hit.The income ide has thrown up starkly different experiences of lockdown, despite the claims the country is \u0027in it together\u0027.While daily habits and routines have been uprooted in the last two months, those with higher incomes have been able to weather the storm better, with more free time and better working habits.Those working in lower paid jobs have been far more likely to be working harder to keep the remnants of the economy moving.According to an ONS survey of activity under lockdown compared with 201415, those earning less than £1,700 a month had lost the most time for personal care - an average of 21 minutes a day lost.At the same time they are working more, an average increase of 21 minutes per day in paid work. Those earning between £1,700 and £3,300 have been working 30 minutes less a day on average under lockdown.The highest earners have gained, on average, 47 minutes of leisure time a day under lockdown - two and a half times higher than the lowest earners, with around 19 minutes a day more free time.One of the danger areas for catching the virus is thought to be public transport because people are forced to come into close contact with many other people in an enclosed environment.Having a car or a van obviously allows you to avoid travelling via these means, making it easy to escape your immediate environment and go further afield for excercise.Again, your ability to do this is directly correlated with your income group with 65 per cent of households in the poorest tenth of the country not owning a car or a van.At the other end of the scale, 69 per cent of the richest 10th of households have at least two vehicles.With most people mainly confined to their homes, never has garden space been so coveted than during the past 10 weeks. The size of your garden and whether you have one at all is informed largely by the part of the country in which you live.Figures from the ONS show that 3.3 million addresses across the country are entirely without access to garden space with the majority of these being flats rather than houses.Perhaps unsurprisingly many of these garden-less homes are located in London with 766,224 addresses listed as being without one.London\u0027s gardens also tend to be on the small size with the mean being 196.5 metres squared compared with 427 metres squared in the South East of England.These numbers may seem large but because they are the mean average they are skewed by very large gardens and by communal gardens, which tend to be bigger.It should also be noted that although people living in a flat may have access to a private garden it doesn\u0027t mean they have exclusive access. In fact the average number of flats sharing a garden is 3.5 across Great Britain.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11th june 2020","story":"Social distancing markers around the penguin enclosure at ZSL London Zoo in the capital\u0027s Regent\u0027s Park, where staff from the zoo have been preparing and are now ready for reopening next week with new signage, one-way trails laid out for visitors to follow, and extra handwashing and sanitiser stations in placePolitics latest news: Schools will not be open for key workers this summer, Downing Street admitsCoronavirus latest news: One third of people with Covid-19 could not be contacted by NHS Test and Trace Nigel Farage leaves LBC with immediate effectComment: We cannot let these Marxist vandals humiliate us in their mindless iconoclasmNHS Test and Trace system failed to reach one in three positive cases in first weeksSwiss boy given police record for asking if he can pay with toy moneyTurkish president accused of creating \u0026#39militia\u0026#39 as neighbourhood watch is given powers to carry gunsThe problem with the UK\u0026#39s testing dataComment: We should not allow the new puritans to dictate our livesEmmanuel Macron may resign and hold snap election as \u0026#39I\u0026#39m sure to win\u0026#39, he reportedly claimsComment: The Hackney assault on police is a sickening sign that mob rule is taking overPandemic has led to rise in Rohingya domestic abuse cases, charity warnsComment: Listen to the people, we cannot tax our economy into prosperity after this crisisPrivate firms will be stripped of a role in rehabilitating offenders as probation returns to public sectorCovid-19\u0026#39s \u0026#39devastating\u0026#39 impact on cancer servicesNo touching, no group dancing and no kissing – Bollywood prepares for life in the coronavirus eraCoronavirus positive: Good news round-up -Hundreds of elephants make their way homeComment: It’s time to get over isive notions about race and focus on what brings us togetherComment: Ignore Neil Ferguson\u0026#39s guesswork - the post-mortem on Covid-19 is best left until this is all overBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/06/08/TELEMMGLPICT000232704659_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"travel latest news scottish tourism leaders welcome july restart","story":"All UK arrivals are required to self-isolated for 14 days under current rulesKey dates: When will destinations around the world reopen to British tourists?

However, they will have little effect under quarantine regulation that the IATA says is killing air travel and wreaking more damage on jobs and the economy.The government must scrap the quarantine, or implement its plan for travel corridors as soon as possible. There’s still just enough time to save the summer if they move quickly, said Rafael Schvartzman, IATA’s regional vice president for Europe.The UK\u0027s new air travel rules – which meet international guidelines set down by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the recommendations of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)–  include:Face coverings for passengers, crew and airport staffIncreased cleaning of surfaces and use of hand sanitizer Clear communications to travellers on measures and expectations regarding COVID-19Measures to ensure social distancing at the airport but no requirement for temperature screening or COVID testingReducing contact on board, for example, reduced refreshment service and duty free sales, preventing queuing for toilets, use of pre-packaged meals, and availability of hand sanitizerSocial distancing to be enabled on board depending on load factor and weight and balance requirements but no requirement to block the middle seat.A 14-day quarantine for all UK arrivals was brought in on June 8 and tourism and airline leaders are urging for the regulation to be dropped. Paul Charles, a spokesman for the Quash Quarantine group of more than 500 travel, hospitality and hotel businesses, said on Wednesday: “If we still have quarantine in place and other countries have opened up, then we will lose potentially millions of tourists who would have come here to other countries.”Follow the latest news below.Silversands Grenada made a splash when it opened in late 2018, sitting on the island’s best beach and boasting the Caribbean’s longest swimming pool. Closed since March, it will reopen today with a raft of safety measures, reports Emma Beaumont.Upon arrival at the airport, visitors will undergo a rapid Covid-19 test before being whisked off to the high-end hotel by private car. Guests will also receive a care package, which will include personalised hand sanitiser, masks and gloves. Other modifications include digital menus in the restaurants, while sun loungers around the pool will be spaced two-metres apart. All staff members will have their temperatures checked twice a day.Beachfront Villas are the rooms to book to ensure social distancing. Each comes with a fully equipped kitchen, private pool, plus indoor and outdoor living spaces.

Those returning from the common travel area – which includes the Republic – are not required to self-isolate for two weeks upon their return to the UK. With this in mind,  Travel\u0027s Emma Cooke has the ultimate guide to Ireland, including what to see, where to stay, and the best things to eat and drink. Ireland\u0026#39s wide open spaces can be enjoyed without facing quarantine on your returnTui UK and Ireland has cancelled all beach holidays up to and including July 10. It had previously extended cancellations until June 30. All customers whose bookings are affected by the change will receive a refund credit – they can also request a cash refund via the company\u0027s online form.Customers who had booked a package holiday over this period will be given an incentive of up to 20 per cent off if they rebook with Tui. Those due to travel with the company before the end of August can modify their booking without charge. Tui said in a statement: “We are constantly monitoring the situation and will start taking people on holiday again as soon as we are able to do so.”The Males Ministry of Tourism is planning to welcome visitors next month without any restrictions: no minimum stay requirement, and, crucially, no testing, Emma Cooke reports.The move is a complete 180 from previous announcements that the Males would aim to set itself apart as a safe tourism destination and a Covid-free country with strict testing requirements. This could be a risky move. Of approximately 2,000 confirmed cases, there have been only eight deaths in the Males. With just nine to 26 confirmed cases per day since June 2, the country is in a good position to contain the virus – given this progress, inviting a wave of unrestricted tourists into the country could prove problematic. Read the full report, here.On Monday, Iceland will begin to welcome international visitors for the first time since the country went into lockdown in March, Hugh Morris reports.That Icelandair, the flag carrier, has only two flights from the UK on the day is perhaps a reflection on how the Nordic nation intends to restart its tourism offering: with caution. Anyone who does make it to Iceland on June 15 - there is also a Wizz Air flight arriving into Reykjavik late morning from London Luton - will be given the option of a coronavirus test on arrival (free until July 1, and then at a cost of 15,000 Icelandic krona £88) or a two-week quarantine.“Utmost care is being taken not to jeopardise the success achieved in Iceland during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said prime minister Katrin Jakobsdottir. As a result of these measures, for the first time in years foreign visitors will be outnumbered by locals.Read the full article, here.The Portuguese tourism board has launched an official platform to help travellers identify establishments that have been awarded a clean \u0026amp safe stamp. The search tool identifies the location of places with a stamp, which includes accommodation providers, restaurants, golf courses, car rental companies, tourism agencies, casinos and cultural facilities, and what requirements they must meet. Customers will also be able to evaluate companies and organisations listed on the platform.

The company said it is losing £2 million a month while hotels are closed. Even with the provisional July 15 restart date, hotel room capacity and services are likely to be much reduced, meaning there will be fewer staff required.The monument will reopen on July 4, too late for the annual celebration, which is one of the rare occasions that the stones are usually accessible to the public. While people cannot physically watch the rising of the sun at Stonehenge in 2020, it is hoped that they will be able to join in virtually, writes Sophie Campbell.“We really hope that people will live stream it at home,” said Stonehenge Director Nichola Tasker. “We’ll be streaming from sunset the night before and we’ll be live from about 3.30am for the sunrise. We’ve been live streaming the summer solstice for about five years now – but this year there won’t be 10,000 people there celebrating.Celebrations will be virtual this yearDisneyland Park and Disney California Adventure park could open from July 17, pending approval from local and state authorities. The theme parks, based in Anaheim, California, shut on March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19. Under the reopening plans, capacity will be limited and visitors will have to secure a booking in advance. Experiences such as parades and character meet-and-greets will be unavailable to begin with. Disney executive Chairman Bob Iger has previously said that theme park visitors may be required to have their temperatures checked when the attractions reopen. Shanghai Disneyland witnessed a muted reopening in May after a three-month shutdown. The multi-billion-dollar safari industry has crunched to a standstill in the pandemic and rural communities are suffering. From Kenya’s Masai Mara to the Okavango Delta in Botswana, those that depend on safaris for income are seeing it melt away, reports Reuters. A lion crosses marshland in the Okavango Delta, BotswanaHundreds of thousands of workers, and their dependents, rely on the sector, which is unravelling amid closed borders and grounded airlines. The shutdown has also dealt a blow to conservation projects. The safari industry generates some $12.4 billion (£9.76 billion) in annual revenues for South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia – Africa’s top wildlife tourist destinations – according to an estimate by SafariBookings.A  survey of over 300 tour operators carried out by the online safari travel platform found that almost 93 per cent reported a drop in bookings of at least 75 per cent due to the pandemic. Find out how South Africa\u0027s tourism industry is planning for a September restart. A mere nine per cent of Britons believe that the economy will be unaffected by the Government\u0027s quarantine for UK arrivals, according to a new survey.The research was carried out on behalf of Quash Quarantine, a group of over 500 travel and hospitality firms seeking to overturn the UK\u0027s 14-day mandatory self-isolation rules.Some 38 per cent of respondents thought the Government should have conducted an economic impact assessment prior to introducing the measures. Meanwhile, 85 per cent said they lack confidence in the Government being able to successfully implement the quarantine.George Morgan-Grenville, leader of the Quash Quarantine group and chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, said: “These figures tell us the true feeling of the UK public about these unworkable and disproportionate quarantine measures. It’s staggering that the Government seems willing to gamble with people’s livelihoods in the travel and hospitality sector, with apparently little regard for the hundreds of thousands of jobs likely to be lost.Of those surveyed, 59 per cent supported the idea of travel corridors or \u0027air bridges\u0027 to connect the UK with other countries and circumvent quarantine. The survey of 2,102 people was carried out by independent research company AudienceNet. Boris Johnson made a bid to save our summer holidays, saying that he will take personal charge of “air bridges” –  bilateral travel agreements that circumvent quarantine measuresZoos and safari parks in England will be able to reopen from MondayHalf of travellers are considering flouting FCO advice, according to a  Travel poll The spread of coronavirus cases was found to be highly correlated with the extent of air travel, according to a study by the Institute for Economics and PeaceLandlords warned that social distancing rules could lead to the death of the country pub Take a look at Wednesday\u0027s blog for moreCoronavirus latest news: One third of people with Covid-19 could not be contacted by NHS Test and Trace Politics latest news: Schools will not be open for key workers this summer, Downing Street admitsNigel Farage leaves LBC with immediate effectComment: We cannot let these Marxist vandals humiliate us in their mindless iconoclasmNHS Test and Trace system failed to reach one in three positive cases in first weeksSwiss boy given police record for asking if he can pay with toy moneyTurkish president accused of creating \u0026#39militia\u0026#39 as neighbourhood watch is given powers to carry gunsThe problem with the UK\u0026#39s testing dataComment: We should not allow the new puritans to dictate our livesEmmanuel Macron may resign and hold snap election as \u0026#39I\u0026#39m sure to win\u0026#39, he reportedly claimsComment: The Hackney assault on police is a sickening sign that mob rule is taking overPandemic has led to rise in Rohingya domestic abuse cases, charity warnsComment: Listen to the people, we cannot tax our economy into prosperity after this crisisPrivate firms will be stripped of a role in rehabilitating offenders as probation returns to public sectorCovid-19\u0026#39s \u0026#39devastating\u0026#39 impact on cancer servicesNo touching, no group dancing and no kissing – Bollywood prepares for life in the coronavirus eraCoronavirus positive: Good news round-up -Hundreds of elephants make their way homeComment: It’s time to get over isive notions about race and focus on what brings us togetherComment: Ignore Neil Ferguson\u0026#39s guesswork - the post-mortem on Covid-19 is best left until this is all overBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/15/16/pixel3.jpg","title":"android 11 beta download new features release google install how","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Google is also making it easier for users to deal with all their notifications and privacy permissionsThe Android 11 beta is now available on all Pixel phones, bringing with it tweaks to how it handles notifications, media controls, payment interface, and many more smaller changes.The beta allows users to access pre-release features on Google\u0027s operating system, at the risk of some software bugs.One of the most important ways that Android has been updated is its notification menu, in an attempt to keep vital conversations separate from the barrage of other pop-ups users receive from every app.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis is done by binning notifications into sections. The first is “Conversations”, which is for messaging apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and so on.This keeps them separate from your other notifications so you can always find the people you\u0027re messaging.Google Maps adds coronavirus warnings to directionsThe other sections are priority notifications, and silent ones.Priority notifications will appear in the status bar and on the lock screen, and will always show up at the top of the panel.Silent notifications, in contrast, will keep the notifications at the bottom of the section, but will avoid your phone buzzing with every message. This is useful for group chats that you need to keep an eye on, but do not require constant attention.Also, like Facebook Messenger, the “chat heads” feature is now available to any messaging app. These small bubbles float on top of your other apps, so you can quickly access any conversation.The second most important change is to media controls. Before, these lived separately to the drop-down settings menu, accessible when you swipe from the top of your Android screen.Now, they’re integrated into that menu, and have greater functionality. Users can now quickly switch audio output from that panel between headphones, your phone’s speakers, and audio devices like the Google Home.Google has also added a new way to control smart home devices: long-pressing on the power button will bring up controls for your lights or thermometers.That’s also where Google is keeping credit cards and other payment methods such as Google Pay.Finally, Google is making a smattering of other updates. Its default keyboard, Gboard, will let you make custom emoji stickers as well as auto-filling content.You’ll also be able to add new shapes for Android icons to make themes better. Dark Mode will have smoother scheduling options, too.Android’s permissions are also getting further privacy features. Much like Apple, there will now be a one-time permission button so you can hand over your location data in a particular instance without worrying an app would be tracking you constantly.Google has been criticised, and sued, for its confusing permissions so it will be interesting to see how this new update affects it.Finally, Android has a new accessibility update which means your phone now understands what’s on your screen. Users can now control the phone completely with their voice.Tech giants launch new plan to stop child abuse contentGoogle Maps adds coronavirus warnings to directionsHow do Siri, Google and Alexa respond to Black Lives Matter questions?Facebook tool to transfer images to Google Photos available worldwideGoogle Search adds automatic highlights and scrolling to articlesPreviously, people who could not use the screen would need to say a series of numbers that correspond to digital buttons. When using Twitter, for example, there might be a number one next to the ‘tweet’ button, a two next to ‘cancel’, a three next to the camera icon and so on.Now, users can simply say “Twitter” to open the app, “scroll down” to scroll, “Home” to go back to the home screen, and so on.To try out the beta, you’ll require either a Google Pixel 2, 3, or 4 model of phone. However, it is recommended to only install pre-release operating systems on spare devices because of potential bugs.Should you install and find an issue, you can reset your phone back to Android 10 – but beware, as that may wipe your existing content off your phone.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Headquarters in both countries will not be affected but the company’s legal base will switch to London.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted that the decision was a “clear vote of confidence in the UK”.Unilever was forced into an embarrassing U-turn in 2018 after announcing plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam and ditch its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Nestle and Unilever ‘linked to Indonesian forest fires’Some shareholders objected to the proposals which were later ditched, with former chief executive, Paul Polman, and previous chair, Marijn Dekkers, both quitting soon after.After the new legal entity is established in the UK, Unilever plans to keep its main stock market listing in London with secondary listings in Amsterdam and New York. The company revealed it had not consulted Dutch shareholders about the plan, meaning there is a possibility they could block it, as British shareholders did in 2018.Its unusual dual structure emerged in 1930 after British soap manufacturer Lever Brothers merged with Dutch firm Margarine Unie to create Unilever.Establishing the new setup will simplify the business, with board members meeting in London rather than alternating between two headquarters in different countries.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

I’m sitting down with a cup of tea and a biscuit with my friend of three decades,” he said. “I’m taken aback, but I can’t show it. When I arrived, she greeted me with a hug, as one of her ­closest friends.“Barbara was my ‘TV mum’ on EastEnders and is hilariously funny and ­vivacious, with a rapier wit – we’ve always had a giggle, on and off set. But now she clearly has no idea who I am,” he continued, describing Windsor asking him: “Who are you?” and “What are you doing here?”Alanis Morissette: ‘I would put s around 19-year-old Alanis’Orlando Weeks: ‘The reason for the Maccabees split is our thing’I love Keeping up with the Kardashians – but coronavirus might ruin itWindsor, who became a household name through the Carry On films and appearing in EastEnders as pub landlady Peggy Mitchell since 1994, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2014.While her health has declined in recent years, the actor was named in 2019 as a new ambassador for the Alzheimer’s Society and joined a campaign encouraging the Prime Minister to review the “devastating” state of care for the disease.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Modern slavery victims are being deported to countries where they are at high risk of further exploitation because the Home Office is relying on a flawed interpretation of evidence, lawyers and researchers have warned.Guidance used by caseworkers to assess whether people trafficked to the UK can be sent back to Vietnam or Albania – the two most common nationalities for modern slavery victims in Britain – is “significantly misleading” about the risks, one told The Independent.The situation has “horrendous human consequences” if trafficking victims are refused asylum and returned to countries where they are unlikely to receive adequate protection.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGovernment figures show 1,705 Albanians were identified as potential modern slavery victims by the UK’s National Referral Mechanism (NRM) last year, making it the most commonly referred foreign nationality, while 887 referrals were of Vietnamese origin, making it the second-most commonly referred.Victims identified through the NRM can apply for asylum if they wish to remain in the UK due to fear of returning to the country from which they were trafficked.Record high 10,000 suspected modern slavery victims in UKPotential slavery victims to be deported on charter flight to PakistanHome Office leaves modern slavery victim ‘in limbo’ for five yearsHowever, a report published last month by Asylos, a charity that produces its own reports on country-of-origin information, found many victims were at serious risk of re-trafficking in Vietnam due to economic vulnerability, problems accessing social services, stigma and unpaid debts to traffickers.It also found that recognition by the NRM as a victim of trafficking would not automatically confer the same status with officials in Vietnam, making them potentially ineligible for assistance.The report included one example of a Vietnamese boy who was trafficked from the country twice, once to China, and then once to Laos for sex exploitation, before he was found in Poland.For Albania, the Home Office’s guidance makes almost no mention of boys and young men, which experts said leads to the impression that male victims do not face any issues that would entitle them to asylum in Britain.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever, Asylos last year found boys and young men in Albania are being targeted for exploitation by groups associated with organised crime, some of which have links within the UK.Trafficking victims ‘left without access to justice’ under new rulesDavid Neale, legal researcher and formerly a barrister at Garden Court Chambers, told The Independent that the Home Office guidance on both Vietnam and Albania “painted the country of origin as able to protect the person adequately when that’s very often just fundamentally not the case”.He noted that the government’s assertion that victims were likely to be able to access effective protection from the state in Vietnam was “flatly contradicted” both by the Asylos report and by some of the information included in the Home Office’s own guidelines.“It’s wholly wrong to say that in general people are going to be able to avail themselves of sufficient state protection because in a lot of cases they’re just not. They’re not going to be recognised as trafficking victims at all, and whatever services might be available are just not going to be made available to them,” he said.“Sometimes the Home Office conclusions are significantly misleading. Yet they are presented as if they are evidence when the country summary is not evidence and is in my view extremely problematic and potentially very misleading and I think does mislead a lot of people.”Mr Neale said the “misconceived” guidance was part of a “culture of refusal” within the Home Office that he said was “set up to disbelieve people and to try and paint the country of origin as able to protect the person adequately when that’s very often just fundamentally not the case”.He said negative asylum decisions based on this guidance risked “absolutely horrendous human consequences” for the victims.“They’ll go to appeal, but if they’re unrepresented or not well represented, the judge may not be cognisant of all these issues around the Home Office narrative and they just accept the Home Office narrative, and they could end up in detention – they could end up removed,” he said.“Equally, they could end up living an underground life in the UK for a long period with no access to legitimate work or benefits, which obviously makes people extremely vulnerable to re-trafficking and abuse and labour exploitation.“And even if they’re able to get legal representation to appeal, people can be waiting months or years for their appeal, during which they’re likely to be on a minimal level of support – unable to work and claim mainstream benefits. And of course people throughout this period are vulnerable to re-trafficking.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Social distancing markers around the penguin enclosure at London Zoo.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Headquarters in both countries will not be affected but the company’s legal base will switch to London.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted that the decision was a “clear vote of confidence in the UK”.Unilever was forced into an embarrassing U-turn in 2018 after announcing plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam and ditch its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Nestle and Unilever ‘linked to Indonesian forest fires’Some shareholders objected to the proposals which were later ditched, with former chief executive, Paul Polman, and previous chair, Marijn Dekkers, both quitting soon after.After the new legal entity is established in the UK, Unilever plans to keep its main stock market listing in London with secondary listings in Amsterdam and New York. The company revealed it had not consulted Dutch shareholders about the plan, meaning there is a possibility they could block it, as British shareholders did in 2018.Its unusual dual structure emerged in 1930 after British soap manufacturer Lever Brothers merged with Dutch firm Margarine Unie to create Unilever.Establishing the new setup will simplify the business, with board members meeting in London rather than alternating between two headquarters in different countries.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Almost 210,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in New York City alone since the US pandemic began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst one million Americans contracted the virus within the initial three months of the pandemic, the past one million cases were contracted within six weeks, according to the data.  The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption.

What previously took a number of researchers a long time can now be accomplished by one drone operator in minutes.”The paper’s lead author Dr Andrew Dunstan, of the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, said: “Previous population survey methods involved painting a white stripe down the green turtle’s carapace when they were nesting on the beach, then getting on a small boat and counting painted and non-painted turtles.“Our eyes are attracted much more to a turtle with a bright white stripe than an unpainted turtle, but the pain washed off after a few days and the counting accuracy suffered.“Trying to accurately count thousands of painted and unpainted turtles from a small boat in rough weather was difficult. Using a drone is easier, safer, much more accurate and the data is permanently stored,” he added.Managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Anna Marsden, congratulated the researchers and described the images produced by the drone as “extraordinary”.“Raine Island is the world’s largest green turtle nesting site and that’s why we’re working with our Raine Island Recovery Project partners to protect and restore the island’s critical habitat,” she said.“We’re taking action to improve and rebuild the island’s nesting beaches and building fences to prevent turtle deaths, all working to strengthen the island’s resilience and ensure the survival of our northern green turtles and many other species.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.As the government continues to flip-flop over its plans to reopen schools in England, provoking uncertainty and anger among the education sector, other countries across the world have already succeeded in sending children back to class.Earlier this week, education secretary Gavin Williamson admitted that not all pupils would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September, despite initial aims to begin the phased reopening of all primary schools from 1 June.  In contrast, thousands of children in countries such as Denmark, Germany, France, South Korea and China have been back in class for weeks. Here, we take a look at what the rest of the world is doing:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHaving passed through the worse of the crisis, China was one of the first countries to start reopening its schools. In the far-western provinces, some have been opened since mid-March, though the vast majority started welcoming students back last month. Class sizes have been reduced, lessons shortened and arrival times staggered to limit the risk of transmission.Schools in cities with large populations, such as Beijing and Shanghai, are running classes with a maximum of 20 students to allow social distancing. Pupils have also been told to walk or be driven to school by their parents, in order to avoid busy public transportation like the subways.Teachers are taking students’ temperatures before they enter buildings while thermal scanners have been introduced in some schools those with a fever are sent home.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsA country that has been credited with its rapid and effective Covid-19 response, South Korea began reopening its high schools last month. On 8 June, lower-level pupils started returning to school in phased steps.Under new sanitation rules, students and teachers must wear masks except at mealtimes and clean their desks, which are spaced 1 metre apart and have been fitted with plastic partitions in some schools.Like China, authorities in South Korea have turned to thermometers to help monitor the temperature of pupils and teachers. And if any student tests positive for the virus, the entire school is expected to switch to online classes for at least two weeks.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than 500 schools were last month forced to close just days after they had re-opened, due to a spike in cases in Seoul and its surrounding metropolitan area.With responsibility for education devolved to the country’s 16 federal states, some regions have been moving quicker than others in opening schools.In general, younger students and those with exams to sit have been prioritised in returning to class. Schools in some states have been opened since 27 April to allow pupils to take their tests.To reduce the risk of transmission, class sizes have been cut in half, one-way systems enforced in corridors, and lunch breaks staggered.Many states are aiming to have all classes in schools and kindergartens return before the start of the summer break, which starts as early as 22 June in some parts of the country.Denmark was the first European country to reopen primary schools and kindergartens, doing so in mid-April. Secondary students started returning to class on 18 May.Denmark reopens schools and shops, sparking concerns from parentsYounger pupils are expected to remain in “protective bubbles”, which keeps them from mixing with other teachers and groups of children. They use different entrances to their fellow pupils and must wash their hands at least every two hours.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.When it comes to ruthless colonialism and racism, few historical figures are more notorious than Leopold II, the king of the Belgians who held Congo as his personal property and may have been responsible for the deaths of millions of Congolese more than a century ago.Yet across Belgium, the monarch\u0027s name is still found on streets and tunnels. Cities are dotted with his statues and busts, even as evidence of his misdeeds has piled up over the decades.Now a reckoning seems to be at hand.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe protests sweeping the world after George Floyd\u0027s killing in the US have added fuel to a movement to confront Europe\u0027s role in the slave trade and its colonial past. Leopold is increasingly seen as a stain on the nation where he reigned from 1865 to 1909. Demonstrators want him removed from public view.In just the last week, a long-running trickle of dissent that resulted in little more than occasional vandalism has turned into a torrent, with statues of Leopold defaced in a half-dozen cities. In the port town of Antwerp, where much of the Congolese rubber, minerals and other natural riches entered the nation, one statue was burned and had to be removed for repairs. It is unclear whether it will ever come back.Statue of slave trader Edward Colston fished out of Bristol HarbourChristopher Columbus statue set alight, thrown in lake by protestersConfederate statue removed from Florida park“When you erect a statue, it lauds the actions of who is represented. The Germans would not get it into their head to erect statues of Hitler and cheer them,” said Mireille-Tsheusi Robert, president of the Congolese action group Bamko-Cran, which wants all Leopold statues removed from Belgian cities. “For us, Leopold has committed a genocide.”Similar efforts are unfolding in Britain, where at least two statues of prominent figures connected to the slave trade have been taken down by protesters or city officials. London\u0027s mayor has promised a review of all monuments.Leopold ruled Congo as a fiefdom, forcing many of its people into slavery to extract resources for his personal profit. His early rule, starting in 1885, was famous for its brutality, which some experts say left as many as 10 million dead.After his ownership of Congo ended in 1908, he handed the central African country over to the Belgian state, which continued to hold sway over an area 75 times its size until the nation became independent in 1960.Leopold has come to symbolise the racism and inequality citizens of Congolese descent have had to endure. Next to the royal palace stands an equestrian statue with Leopold gazing solemnly towards the horizon. On Wednesday, his hands and eyes were covered with red paint, and expletives were spray-painted on the side of the monument.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMaximilian Christiaens, an architect with a Congolese mother and Belgian father, who came to see the statue after the defacing, realises the issue is part of his identity. Since Congo achieved independence, Belgium\u0027s Congolese population has swelled to about 230,000 in a nation of 11 million.“You know, we feel at home here, but seeing symbols like this in the city and all over the country gives us the opposite signal,” Mr Christiaens said. He would like to see them torn down.A similar struggle is playing out in the majestic woods east of Brussels in Tervuren, where the palatial Royal Museum for Central Africa stands. It was built over a century ago to glorify Leopold\u0027s colonial exploits and to convince Belgium citizens that their country was delivering civilisation to the heart of wild Africa.Museum director Guido Gryseels fully understands the challenges and the sensitivities, especially after a Leopold statue was defaced in the gardens outside the museum last week. He has sought to shift the museum\u0027s views on colonialism into a contemporary reassessment of a flawed past. This week, the Black Lives Matter logo was displayed on digital screens at the museum entrance.As part of a major renovation he oversaw, Mr Gryseels consigned the racist statues of Congolese and the glorifying busts of the Belgian military to the “depot” of outdated sculptures in the museum\u0027s cellars.“We wanted to keep them somewhere so that the visitors could still see, so that we could explain: \u0027This is how we looked at Africa before,\u0027” Mr Gryseels said.Oxford University head warns against ‘hiding history’ in statue rowBanksy suggests replacement for toppled statue of Bristol slave traderMuseums and cinemas reopen in Denmark as Copenhagen eases lockdownUpstairs, in the grand rooms, the only bust of Leopold on display is made of ivory and aims to explain how the plunder of the country extended to the wholesale slaughter of elephants.As a listed architectural treasure, Leopold\u0027s royal double L monogram is still plastered all over the building. But Congolese artists have been asked to make a counterpoint, and in the main hall now stands a sculpture of a skull of a Congolese chief who was beheaded by a Belgian. In front of statues that could not be moved because they were protected, there are now transparent drapes with images criticising Belgian actions in Congo.“It would have been impossible 30 years ago, but there is a step forward,” Ms Robert said. Still, she said the changes do not go far enough and the museum needs to better embrace Congolese in its management structure.Just about everybody acknowledges that Belgian society needs to take a hard look at its past. The Catholic church, the dominant force in education during much of Belgium\u0027s existence, was at worst an active participant in colonialism, at best a passive bystander. And since many Belgians had family members who went to Congo to seek their fortunes, there is a sense of unease in confronting the history of racism and exploitation.“The amnesia is linked to the money the Belgians made in Congo,” Ms Robert said.For many years, Belgian colonial authorities peddled the idea that the king went to Congo to stop the slave trade, Mr Gryseels said, when it was really “a pretext to make big economic gains”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

and the screen and stage couldduring the summer.Several drive-in cinemas will open from June , following a statement from the PM.At the Drive In, Luna Cinema, and Pub in the Park are all offering drive-in screenings across the UK, but won’t be starting until the beginning of July.Luna Cinema will host drive-in cinema nights at a number of venues including Allianz Park in London, Warwick Castle in the Midlands, Knebworth House in Herts and Bleinheim Palace in Oxford.More venues are expected to be revealed soon.All cars will be two metres apart and all food will be pre-ordered to minimise contact.The Drive In has planned film screenings, stand-up comedy and live music at the Troubadour Meridian Water in Enfield, starting July .Tom Kerridge’s Pub in the Park will launch Drive  Dine Theatre at Syon Park and Selhurst Park Stadium in London.Films on show will include Jaws, Aladdin, , Knives Out and Back to the Future.Sunset Cinema at Twyford Avenue Sports Ground in London will be showing Bohemian Rhapsody, La La Land, Grease, Joker and The Lion King.Other venues include Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle.Suffolk’s Helmingham Hall near Stowmarket will also welcome Brits to screenings in July with live entertainment and classic movies from the s.Cinemas could be opened as part of the third step of the governments three stage plan to reopen the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic.It is hoped some leisure facilities will be able to open from July  at the absolute earliest - with cinemas being explicitly named in the documents.In the plan released on May , the government said: The ambition at this step is to open at least some of the remaining businesses and premises that have been required to close.It added: They should also meet the Covid- Secure guidelines.Some venues which are, by design, crowded and where it may prove dficult to enact distancing may still not be able to re-open safely at this point, or may be able to open safely only in part.Nevertheless the Government will wish to open as many businesses and public places as the data and information at the time allows.All measures laid out in the new blueprint are dependent on how successfully the UK can control the virus, and social distance measures will still be in place.Mr Johnson has said he will slam on the brakesit looks like Britain is being threatened by a second wave of infections.Vue Cinemas is planning for a reopening on July  and will introduce a string of measures to make it safe for staff and customers.Tickets will only be able to be booked online to make sure that only viewers who live in the same household will sit together in groups.It will also stagger film times to help maintain social distancing rules between screens.The chain said enhanced cleaning and employee protection protocols will be introduced.They added: Big screen entertainment is a force for good in society, providing an accessible and controlled way for families to begin to enjoy le outside their homes and we are excited to be able to start planning for a future where we can enjoy movies together again.Tim Richards, head of Vue, previously said he hoped to open up screens again in time for the release of Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan’s new film, the £ million high-concept blockbuster Tenet - slated for release on July .The live-action version of Mulan and new James Bond film No Time To Die are also set to be screened this summer after being put on hold due to the virus.Theatres are also folded into step three of the plan - meaning they will open from July  at the very earliest.Stage fans however may have a chance to view live-streamed or broadcast productions of shows during step two.The second stage guidance includes options for cultural events to occur behind closed doors.It is currently unclear how this would work as industries across the UK to try work out how to adapt to the new normal.Some shows, such as the Menier transfer of the Jane Austen adaptation The Watsons to the Harold Pinter theatre, which was due in May, had to be cancelled due to the pandemic.Others, like To Kill A Mockingbird at the Gielgud, have been postponed.In early May, theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the lockdown measures mean West End theatres are unlikely to reopen until .Playwright James Graham was even less hopeful.He says the theatre wont survive without an “aggressive government bailout”.The Government has released its road map to ease us out of the nationwide restrictions - starting on Wednesday, May , with unlimited exercise and some sectors such as construction and manufacturing making a limitedto work.Mr Johnson unveiled the three-step plan during an address to the nation on Sunday, May .Along with it he also revealed the Covid Alert System, which offers five tiers of warning levels indicating the severity of the virus.Britain is currently in level four -

And this is not the case for Maddies parents. #We think that the parents dont have anything to do with it. #We are convinced that our -year-old suspect is the murderer of Maddie McCann.#A PIECE of blue material held of a Portuguese forensic lab could provide the vital link between Christian B and Madeleine.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders .. A happier, funnier show that’s only on twice a week, where the BBC doesn’t endlessly bask in its own right-on virtue and the majority of characters actually sound like Londoners, instead of stage-schooleditorials.But that’s not going to happen, is it So I’m just going to enjoy the silence. Tarzan like.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in the Midlands shares its name with a meeting between two sporting rivals ”Bill: “Birmingham.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an th century poem, what season of the year did Keats describe as ‘a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Ben Shephard: “The Anglo-Dutch wars were fought primarily between England and which modern-day country ”Amy: “Denmark.”.THE Last Leg, Desiree Burch on the George Floyd fallout: “Follow black artists and thinkers on social media, people who have good resources, information, opinions and insights. Right now I have two shows you could watch — Desiree’s Coming Early and Tar Baby.”Or you could watch Too Hot To Handle, where Netflix films young people having sex while artist thinker Desiree offers her “insights and opinions”.But she’s clearly too modest to mention her role on that one.THIS week’s winner is Tory MP Andrew Bridgen and Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice But Dim. Sent in by RJ.FIRST job for the Beeb’s new Director General, Tim Davie  Find out how Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer ended up on primetime, Saturday night, BBC. Seriously, how  It’s a late-night ITV show, with no one to bleep out the swearing, but with BBC levels of over-manning.The star, obviously, was Peter Crouch, who’s actually funnier than  per cent of TV comedians and more likable than all of them, but not yet ready to front his own show. So they added Maya Jama, who looked sensational in her Status Quo Blue For You-era denims, the compulsory Horne Section and Chris Ramsey, who was hiding behind a fence at the start. And should’ve stayed there. All deserve our sympathy. SOS was meant to be a Euro  spin-off and when the tournament vanished so did the show’s point. Camera angles also seem to have gone to hell, but that’s maybe an act of socially distanced mercy given what’s happening front and centre.Saturday’s content included: A teabag- flipping contest between Mo Farah and Ellie Simmonds, parachuting with Jermaine Jenas, which was straight off the Alan Partridge script and foul-mouthed football “bantz” from Rio Ferdinand, who said his career was ended by Peter Crouch, so may have been playing keepy-uppy to the Match Of The Day theme tune as some sort of twisted payback.The really alarming thing, though, is the series lasts eight weeks.Save Our Summer  At this rate, there’ll be a dark cloud hanging over autumn as well.For the record, it was the BBC News.SPRINGWATCH’s Steve Backshall wearing a “No planet B” T-shirt like he’s a -year-old student, rather than a -year-old BBC presenter who won’t shut up about his three kids. Bafta giving nominations to The Greatest Dancer and The Ranganation but not a Best Drama nod to Line Of Duty.This Morning’s Phillip Schofield losing his very short temper with John Torode over yoghurt dressing. Anyone who says “chowing down” instead of eating. And the clearly smitten GMB host Susanna Reid making an involuntary groping gesturewith her left hand, just after she says the name Keir Starmer. Easy tiger.PETER Crouch: “It wasn’t all about improving, it was also about getting better.”Ian Wright: “The one thing about Gerrard was his professionalism and the fact he was so versatile.”Paul Merson: “It was definitely half an open goal.”                                 SKY Documentaries’ McMillion, the best show on TV.Ralph’s wedding on The A Word. ITV’s th birthday tribute to the great Bradley Walsh.The GMB spat between Piers Morgan and Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which had everything except the obvious reprimand: “Rudy. Stop your messin’ around.”And Channel ’s Murder In The Outback, where disgraced Australian lawyer Andrew Fraser proves, beyond much forensic doubt, Bradley Murdoch did indeed kill Peter Falconio.The only slight glitch being, he’s trying to prove the exact opposite.Watch it, Channel , tonight and tomorrow, pm. The self-delusion becomes hypnotic. A Gillian Burke on Springwatch B Connell Waldron on Normal People C Comedian Tom Allen on nearly everything MOST surprising thing about Britain’s Best Parent  Anita Rani isn’t the most annoying person on this Channel  show.In fact, she’s not even close to a medal position thanks to the other five – two couples and a single mum – who must champion their own style of parenting, whether  it’s “pushy” or “vegan” or mollycoddling or just sort of lying around in bed all day treating their offspring as the hired help.Like the rest of us, Channel  silently understands, of course, listening to strangers talk about their small children is no more engaging or enlightening than listening to a ­scientologist talk about L. Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,” ventriloquism, egotism, Roxette’s fourth album Tourism.On the other there’s gender fluid feminist nut Joana, who is attempting to bring up five-year-old son Willow as “a free spirit”, by banning the word “boy”, refusing to buy him “militaristic toys” and plastering her house in idiotic Socialist Worker propaganda.Hopefully, little Willow will be a stalwart of his local golf club and TA unit  in about  years’ time.But that’s no real saving grace for the show, nor a reason to watch any part of Britain’s Best Parent, apart from the final vote where, every week, the studio audience has to choose between those “free spirits” who let the kids rule the roost and those couples, like David and Nicky, who run their house more like an SAS boot camp.And every week, I’m happy to report, they vote for the boot camp.All hope for Britain may not be lost.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right.

Millions of key workers across the supply chain have continued to work throughout this pandemic and are hidden heroes, keeping Britain fed.He added that manufacturers are fully engaged with a wide range of government-led initiatives designed to tackle the huge public health challenge of obesity.  FDF members’ voluntary work is already delivering substantial changes. Compared to four years ago, FDF member products contribute  per cent less calories,  per cent fewer sugars, and  per cent less salt to the average shopping basket.He said the government needs to invest money in specic measures to support people and areas that are most affected by obesity.We believe a whole lestyle approach will be most effective, focusing on how we achieve a balanced diet and keep active, and not on any single nutrient.” To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So we need a strategy. We need leadership, and we need an army of recruits.First, let’s not waste those upcoming summer weeks. There is no need for school to be out for summer.As the Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield has said, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"our schools should be open in some form or other over the six-week summer holidays. We can’t afford to leave it all to the autumn and hope for the best.I am not trying to trap the wonderful teachers into another six weeks without a break. They have already been ­working flat out over the past three months, developing home- learning resources.I understand the practical as well as contractual concerns that need to be negotiated.But without overburdening, or ­risking anyone’s health — where there’s a will, there’s a way.There are teaching staff, ex-teaching staff, retired teaching staff and countless volunteers who I believe are ready and willing to step up and help supervise children under the leadership of professionals.Second, we need to think ­creatively about space.I am the leader of a group of  schools around the country.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"There is just not enough space in any of our school buildings to properly social- ­distance and house all pupils at the same time.We are not alone here.So let’s use other empty buildings — village halls, town halls, hotel conference halls, church halls and closed museums. What great learning opportunities for “bubbles” — those small groups in which all children are taught now.Third, this moment gives us the opportunity to rethink what education is. If it’s true that we are community beings — that we learn in community from one another — then we need to rethink the curriculum.Education has always been about more than maths, English and geography.It is every little bit as much about social and emotional development.Human beings are social beings. We thrive when we are connected and struggle when we’re not. I talked to a GP who lives up our street and is the mother of an ­intelligent six-year-old boy. She told me last week about how concerned she is about him “becoming withdrawn”. She is right to be worried.We have to get used to the fact that “remote” learning will probably be part of the ­equation for the foreseeable future. So, once again, let’s think dferently.Let’s use the days when children are in school with us dferently to the days when they are at home.Leave the academic subjects for days when they can work at home on projects we have set them the day before. While they are with us, concentrate on team-building and emotional and social skills development, making up for the deficit they have suffered through ­lockdown.Through the summer, let’s use lots of play and sports for the same purpose, along with those “catch-up” lessons. We are all going to have to learn how to balance intelligently “remote” home-learning with the “togetherness” opportunities of classroom learning.In a survey by PiXL — a ­national partnership of primary and secondary schools —  per cent of teachers questioned believed the Covid- crisis presents us with an opportunity for root-and-branch reform of educational methodology.So let’s start now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In stem cell therapy, cells are taken from either bone marrow or the patients own heart and injected into other parts of the body in order to repair damaged tissue.Schumacher, who won a record seven F world championships with Benetton and Ferrari, underwent his first stem-cell therapy in Paris in September last year.French journalist Jean-Michel Décugis told The Times that the stem cell therapy will have an anti-inflammatory effect which will mostly likely impact the brain. He said: Our sources say that Michael Schumacher is receiving stem cell perfusions that... produce a systemic anti-inflammatory effect.That is to say they reach the whole body and you could imagine that they reach Michael Schumachers brain.Its quite mysterious. Officially [Menasché] works only on the heart.Stem cell therapy - also known as regenerative medicine - promotes the repair of diseased, injured and dysal tissues.Stem cells are the bodys raw materials - the cells from which all specialised cells, like brain or heart cells, are generated.Under lab conditions stem cells can ide to create daughter cells.These daughter cells can form new specialised cells with a specic- brain, heart muscle, blood or bone cells.The pioneering treatment is still relatively new and many studies are examining its potential.In Michael Schumachers case its understood doctors are aiming to use the treatment to regenerate his nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord.It could involve scientists taking stem cells from the Formula One legends bone marrow, to create new brain and spinal cord cells with an aim of treating those that were injured in his accidentHe is carrying out experiments with [secretome] that is made by a laboratory from new stem cells and injected into veins, until now only on animals.Mr Décugis also claims that Schumacher is being injected with secretome -protein found in the human body - which he says Menasche calls stem cell juice.In October, Menasche warned fans that he does not work miracles following the first widely-reported stem cell therapy on the sports star.He also slammed claims he was carrying out experiments on the legendary racing driver.Speaking with Italian newspaper La Republica, he said: I do not perform miracles.My team and I are not doing an experiment, an abominable term that is not in line with a serious medical view.And after the procedure last year, a nurse told Le Parisien that Schumacher was conscious.She said: Yes he is in my service ... And I can assure you that he is conscious.Speaking about the cutting-edge procedure, Acciari said: Over the past  years, science has made enormous progress with stem cell treatment.But that does not change that we still do not know much about the human brain.We are not able to say what the results will be.In January, Italian brain surgeon Nicola Acciari - who has not reportedly treated the German - claims he will still be changed from the man his millions of fans remember.We must imagine a person very dferent from the one we remember on the track, with a very altered and deteriorated organic, muscular and skeletal structure, said Acciari.All as a result of the brain trauma he suffered, he told Italian newspaper Contro Copertina.Last month, former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa said he is very close to Schumacher and said his situation is not easy.He told Fox Brazil: I know how heis, I have information. My relationship with him has always been very close.It is less close with his we Corinna because she did not go to many races.

And yet a statue of Cromwell stands outside Westminster. Does that mean it should be taken down  No.This is the stuff of academia. This is the stuff of universities. This is what education is all about. I dont think we can pretend our history is dferent from what it was.It follows slave trader Edward Colstons statue being toppled at Bristols Black Lives Matter protest on Sunday, raising fears that others including Winston Churchills Parliament Square monument will face the same fate.Protestors pulled Colstons statue down with rope before rolling it into the harbour while London demonstrators defaced Winston Churchills statue accusing him of being a racist.In  the South African statesman Mandela told Westminster Hall he would team up with a trust founded by Rhodes in order to build a better future for Africans.Rhodes was one of the th centurys most famous imperialists, helping colonise much of Southern Africa and having Rhodesia - now Zimbabwe - and Gambia named after him.As Prime Minister of the Cape Colony from  to , his government restricted the rights of black Africans by setting financial qualications for voting.Rhodes was a student at Oriel, created Rhodes scholarships and gave money to the College.He has now been accused of being racist and a British supremacist with growing calls for institutions to distance themselves from his legacy.In his last testament he said: I contend that we [the English] are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race. I contend that every acre added to our territory means the birth of more of the English race who otherwise would not be brought into existence.He referred to other parts of the world as inhabiting the most despicable specimens of human beings.The Rhodes Must Fall campaign ignited in  at the University of Cape Town and soon won momentum from Oxford students demanding the fall the imperialist above the Oriel College entrance.He died from heart failure in , aged , at his seaside cottage in Muizenberg.In this, I am certain, Cecil John Rhodes and I would have made common cause, he said.Professor Richardson added: Those speeches by Mandela were extraordinary in their generosity.

We have to understand our history and we have to confront our history.Oxfords chancellor Lord Patten said he had been present when Mandela signed the agreement to set up the Mandela Rhodes Foundation. He claimed Mandela said: Cecil Rhodes, you and I are going to have to work together now.Lord Patten told the BBC: For me there is a bit of hypocrisy in Oxford taking money for  scholars a year, about a fth of them from Africa, to come to Oxford, and then saying we want to throw the Rhodes statue in the Thames.For all the problems associated with Cecil Rhodes history,it was alright for Mandela then I have to say its pretty well alright with me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wearing a mask helps to reduce pollen coming into your mouth and nose, which is great.“Adding a pair of wrap around spectacles will keep it out of your eyes.”The pollen forecast ies depending on what part of the country you are in and today the south of the county will be hit by high pollen levels.This week experts warned that pollen would flourish over the next few days.This is while the midlands and north west will have mild pollen and the north and Scotland will have low levels.Dr Glenis added that some areas of the country do have it worse than others.“The south gets the pollen first because the climate is warmer and then the pollen gradually moves northwards so that the far north of Scotland is probably about three weeks behind having its main pollen count.She also said that when the pollen count is high it could trigger first time outbreaks.“There may be people who have not previously been sensitive enough to notice hay fever who will get it this year.”. Use vaselineDabbing a little bit of petroleum jelly around the edges of your nose works as a barrier to trap pollen before you breathe it in.A standard tin of Vaseline will do the trick – just smear a small amount around the edge of your nostrils.. Try some nasal sprayIf you’re struggling with a blocked, itchy or runny nose, a steroid nasal spray might provide you with some extra relief.They work by reducing the inflammation inside the nose.It’s best to try and use them for a week or two before you think your symptoms will start as they can take a few days to work, according to NHS advice.. Shower morePollen can stick around for a while on your skin even after youve gone back indoors.If you have been out in the sun all day then its important to make sure you shower afterwards, this will wash away any of the pollen still attached to your skin and hair.. Cut down on boozeBeer, wine and other spirits all contain histamine - the chemical that sets off allergy symptoms in the body.Sick of fighting against runny eyes  The Met Office recommends sticking to the soft stuff where possible to avoid adding any unnecessary allergy pressure.. Take your meds at the right timeIt may seem obvious for anyone that an antihistamine will help, but its actually knowing when to take them that could make the dference.As well as wearing a mask to help stop symptoms, she added that people who follow a plant-based diet may not experience severe symptoms.Diet is fascinating because diet alters the bacteria living in your gut, and they in turn could alter the way your body reacts immunologically.A diet that is rich in short chain fatty acids promotes good bacteria, and the sorts of things that help that are plant-based foods - fruits, vegetables, and also yogurt and fish.This year the country has seen a clear strain of hay fever related symptoms and Google searches have revealed that more and more people are looking for ways to treat them.Earlier this month money revealed that searches related to hay fever relief wipes had increased by over , per cent during a seven day period at the end of May.Between May  and June , searches for the “best hay fever relief” were up by  per cent.This is while searches for “how to stop hay fever” were up by  per cent.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I like it more and more as I get older, she said.“I made this house around my own le and I wasn’t thinking about it being sellable.“We’re living like two children in a doll’s house and in retrospect why would anybody  want to buy it “I just thought it might go to a mad collector of my work who might want to buy it, but no one was interested.Ms Young said she enjoyed transforming the property from two rundown cottages into a colourful playhouse for adults. “It became a really fun project for me on the side of my pottery business and I was so galvanised by it I ended up neglecting my pottery at times.“I painted it all myself and I would get help for some bitsI was in a hurry and was trying to work on the pottery. When you do it by yourself, you do it with all your heart.“I’ve stopped noticing how colourful it is because I’ve lived here for so long.“Lots of people are self-conscious and don’t say much when they see the decoration, but the right reaction is to laugh and go ‘oh wow.’“It should make you feel like a child walking into a sweet shop.

My relationship with him has always been very close.It is less close with his we Corinna because she did not go to many races. But I think the main thing about all this is that we know that his situation is not easy. He is in a dficult phase but we need to respect him and the family.They do not like to ulge any information, so who am I to do that  Since his accident, Schumachers son Mick has followed in his fathers footsteps and has become a racing driver competing in Formula Two.And Massa said he hopes the Ferrari legend can one day watch his boy compete in the sport he loves.He said: I dream and pray every day that he gets better and that he can appear at a circuit again, especially now that his son is racing.So I pray that it may happen one day.Meanwhile, French newspaper Le Dauphine reports Schumachers latest stem cell procedure could take place in the next few days.Dr Philippe Menasche, who is known as a “pioneer in stem cell surgery”, is reportedly going to carry out another op on the racing drivers heart.But, the exact details of the procedure are unknown and the Frenchmans techniques have been called mysterious.According to Spanish outlet minutos, Menasche is using surgery to transfer stem cells from the Germans heart to his brain. In stem cell therapy, cells are taken from either bone marrow or the patients own heart and injected into other parts of the body in order to repair damaged tissue.Schumacher, who won a record seven F world championships with Benetton and Ferrari, underwent his first stem-cell therapy in Paris in September last year.French journalist Jean-Michel Décugis told The Times that the stem cell therapy will have an anti-inflammatory effect which will mostly likely impact the brain. He said: Our sources say that Michael Schumacher is receiving stem cell perfusions that... produce a systemic anti-inflammatory effect.That is to say they reach the whole body and you could imagine that they reach Michael Schumachers brain.Its quite mysterious. Officially [Menasché] works only on the heart.He is carrying out experiments with [secretome] that is made by a laboratory from new stem cells and injected into veins, until now only on animals.Mr Décugis also claims that Schumacher is being injected with secretome -protein found in the human body - which he says Menasche calls stem cell juice.Stem cell therapy - also known as regenerative medicine - promotes the repair of diseased, injured and dysal tissues.Stem cells are the bodys raw materials - the cells from which all specialised cells, like brain or heart cells, are generated.Under lab conditions stem cells can ide to create daughter cells.These daughter cells can form new specialised cells with a specic- brain, heart muscle, blood or bone cells.The pioneering treatment is still relatively new and many studies are examining its potential.In Michael Schumachers case its understood doctors are aiming to use the treatment to regenerate his nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord.It could involve scientists taking stem cells from the Formula One legends bone marrow, to create new brain and spinal cord cells with an aim of treating those that were injured in his accidentIn October, Menasche warned fans that he does not work miracles following the first widely-reported stem cell therapy on the sports star.He also slammed claims he was carrying out experiments on the legendary racing driver.Speaking with Italian newspaper La Republica, he said: I do not perform miracles.My team and I are not doing an experiment, an abominable term that is not in line with a serious medical view.And after the procedure last year, a nurse told Le Parisien that Schumacher was conscious.She said: Yes he is in my service ... And I can assure you that he is conscious.Speaking about the cutting-edge procedure, Acciari said: Over the past  years, science has made enormous progress with stem cell treatment.But that does not change that we still do not know much about the human brain.We are not able to say what the results will be.In January, Italian brain surgeon Nicola Acciari - who has not reportedly treated the German - claims he will still be changed from the man his millions of fans remember.We must imagine a person very dferent from the one we remember on the track, with a very altered and deteriorated organic, muscular and skeletal structure, said Acciari.All as a result of the brain trauma he suffered, he told Italian newspaper Contro Copertina.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While there have been historic breaches of planning and building control regulations, current legislation places a time limit on any enforcement measures and as a result no further action will be taken.

The MP insisted the government acted in good faith on scientic advice - and claimed the UK was particularly vulnerable because itaposs a travel hub. He said: Huge numbers of lives have been saved by the action the government has taken and the resilience and co-operation of the British people. But he admitted clearly some decisions are easier in hindsight. And he confessed striking a balance between peopleaposs lives and livelihoods was the whole story of the pandemic - despite Health Secretary Matt Hancock claiming there just isnapost a trade-off.It comes exactly  weeks after Boris Johnson claimed in  weeks we can turn the tide.Since then the UKaposs official death toll from confirmed COVID- cases has topped ,. It is over , cases when deaths from suspected cases are included. Prof Ferguson, who had to step down from scientic advisory group SAGE after breaking lockdown, led research that warned mitigating the virus alone would have cost , lives.  Days after his team produced that study, the UK government U-turned and decided to impose a full lockdown from March . The , death toll is clearly lower than the , that was feared. But it is more than double the , that the chief scientic advisor said would be a good outcome.And Prof Ferguson last night said the death toll could have been halved by entering lockdown a week earlier. He told MPs: The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced. So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have then reduced the final death toll by at least a half.  Minister for Regional Growth and Local Government Mr Clarke claimed the UKaposs death toll was so high compared to other countries because the UK is a travel hub. He told Sky News: We should be clear we acted in good faith on the guidance that we received. “We were taking the best possible advice open to us at the time. I don’t think for a second that government failed to listen to our scientists. Askedthe scientists got it wrong, he said: I don’t think they did. “Britain was always going to be hugely exposed to this virus because of some of the features of our society. We are a global travel hub.”  He went on: “Clearly some decisions are easier in hindsight than they are at the time. That’s just the nature of responding to such an unprecedented crisis.” Boris Johnson is currently facing anger from both sides of the virus debate. The death toll is above that of many other countries - but Tory MPs and industry also accuse the government of moving too slowly out of lockdown. Plans to bring all primary school pupils in England back before the summer have been shelved, and the government is under pressure to cut the two-metre distance rule to help them reopen.  Last night Boris Johnson said: Of course weaposve got to learn lessons. But I just think that it is at this stage premature, thereaposs still too much that we donapost know. Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty warned last night: We are not at the end of this epidemic, not by a long shot. We are in the middle of it. But asked todaythe tide had been turned - as Boris Johnson said it would be by now,  weeks ago - Mr Clarke said: I think it has. I thinkyou look both at the number of new infections and new deaths, they are coming down sharply, he said.  As lockdown is eased, ministers have insisted there is no trade-off between the economy and protecting peopleaposs lives. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this week: It is just simplistic to say that there is a trade-off between the economy and health. Yet Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty last night said: Anyone who pretends there is a comfortable option has not understood the situation we’re in. We are obviously having, in government, to balance a large number of risks. What you are trying to do is manage those risks as best we can with the information we have to minimise the risk for the bad outcome and to maximise the possibility of a good outcome. But the idea that there is some option that is completely safe and all fine is clearly not true.

But it comes amid warnings the risk of infection remains high and the epidemic is far from over. We must hope the Government has got this right after so many previous missteps.

It says many children with conditions such as cerebral palsy and scoliosis should no longer be shielded. It adds that the benefits of school in terms of access to therapies and developmental support outweigh the risk of infection. It said: Children and young people who are cared for just in primary care are very unlikely to need to continue to shield.Do you have a coronavirus story to tell  Email webnew@mirrorThe RCPCH has created two lists, with those on List A being advised to continue to shield. These include children with immunodeficiency and immunosuppression, such as those who have had transplants, children having cancer treatment for acute leukaemia and Non-Hodgkinaposs Lymphoma. Children with signicant impairment in their ability to cough and to clear their airways are also on the list.  On the other hand patients on List B can discuss with their doctors whether it is safe for them to stop shielding, and, for example,to school when these reopen. This includes children with some cardiac conditions, those with sickle cell disease and children who were born premature with oxygen requirements. Those with kidney disease, cystic fibrosis or more serious asthma are also included on the B list.  Dr Liz Whittaker, co-author of the guidance for the RCPCH, said: There is a group of children who are very clinically vulnerable, and they should continue to shield. There is a second group who are currently shielding but may not need to do so. Itaposs important for parents and carers to have a conversation with their specialist to determine the best course of action. These conversations will be informed by knowledge of the severity of the disease, intensity of the treatment, and, for some, their home situation. We need to get the balance right between clinical risks and the social impact of shielding.  We know this has been a tough period for lots of children, young people, and their loved ones. This guidance is to help doctors have evidence-based discussions with parents and carers. Figures out last month show that one in  people in England is currently on the Covid- extremely vulnerable shielding list.Data from NHS Digital shows that % of the population in England, or ,, people, have been veried by GPs and hospitals as suffering from conditions that mean they should be closely protected from exposure to coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"girl 2 left needing rabies","story":"NewsGirl, , left needing rabies jabs after bat flew through window and scratched her faceMum Charlene Corcoran, , from Leavesden, Hertfordshire, said her daughter Amelie was attacked at around am - and the little girl has had to have rabies jabs as a resultShareCommentsByHarrison Moore:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsAmelie was left needing rabies jabs after she was scratched by a bat \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Mary Rose Young has been putting her own touches on the beautul country home in Lydney, Gloucestershire, by hand since , when she purchased the property for just £,. After  years in the house, she put it up for sale in  and estate agents told her that she could expect it to fetch at least £, from prospective buyers. But her hopes of selling up to open a boutique hotel nearby were dashed when only one person could be persuaded to view the house, with Mary Rose saying they aposleft pretty quicklyapos. Despite the decor leaving Mary Rose and her husband Phil Butcher stuck in the home, the -year-old potter has refused to paint over her leaposs work and says she still loves her home, which she also uses as a workspace and gallery. She said: I made this house around my own le and I wasnapost thinking about it being sellable. Weaposre living like two children in a dollaposs house and in retrospect why would anybody  want to buy it  Itaposs like a playhouse for adults. I just thought it might go to a mad collector of my work who might want to buy it, but no one was interested.  Only one person came and looked at it in the year it was on the market and they werenapost here long. I think they had just come out of curiosity to see the decoration and were never interested. The estate agents despaired. I could have painted over all my work, but I didnapost want to. I love my house and the house really works for me. Iaposm a colourful person and I even have pink hair. I like it more and more as I get older.  Since the failure to sell left her dreams of running her own hotel in tatters, Mary has doubled down and put even more effort into putting her mark on the property, turning the courtyard into a bright pink painting studio last year. When she originally bought the house, which is comprised of two knocked-through cottages, she painted the entire home white in a bid to bring more light in, but when that failed she began drawing patterns inspired by her colourful pottery on the walls.  She said after doing one wall orange with red dots it helped distract from the fact thereaposs aposhardly any natural lightapos and it went from there.

Elizabeth Boudreaux, , was pronounced dead five times after the horric smash in  - and had to learn to walk and talk again. When she woke up from a coma she was unable to remember anything before the incident, Wales Online reports. She has now spoken out about the moment her mother re-explained racism to her after she noticed people looking at her like a aposfish in a fishbowlapos on display. Speaking following the death of George Floyd, Elizabeth, who has British and Nigerian heritage, said racism is still an issue in Swansea.She said: I went to college after my accident to study counselling. I wanted to do something good and educate myself. A staff member told a story in front of a group of us and said the reason why black people are black is because they donapost wash. I was shocked and confused and everyone was looking at me. It was like I was a fish in a fishbowl on display. I remember feeling unwell that day and afterwards I cried and cried and cried to my mother, who is originally from Nigeria. She explained to me that this is racism and that it has always been around. When I experienced this disgusting behaviour I was in extreme shock I had no idea humans were so cruel to one another.  It might have been the first memory Miss Boudreaux has of racism but it certainly wasnapost her last. She explained that since the Black Lives Matter movement has come to the forefront of debate, she has seen a number of people dismiss suggestions that racism happens in Swansea and other parts of Wales. Racism does exist in Swansea. I myself have experienced it many times, said Elizabeth, who lives in Killay. A few years ago I was in my own front garden doing some weeding and I saw someone with two horses, one white and one brown, over the fence.  They said, while looking at me and laughing: aposYou know, you get white and brown horses tooapos. I just stopped what I was doing and ran back inside. Another time I was in a taxi and was askedIaposm married. I said: aposNo, I have a partnerapos. He said: aposHeaposs black is he apos I said: aposNo, heaposs whiteapos. To that the man responded: aposOh, so you donapost bed your own do you apos. I was in complete disbelief. Elizabeth said she had even witnessed children using racial slurs in Swansea. A child, about the age of five, once called one of my children aposblackieapos while they were out playng. A parent apologised but you think: aposWhere did that child learn it from in the first place apos  Hearing the aposNapos word in music and film really upsets me. I thinkpeople are still using it like that people are going to think itaposs okay. Iaposve heard my childrenaposs friends playing it and all I can hear is that word. I canapost listen to it. Elizabeth said racist comments and experiences build up, making her feel like she canapost always trust people. It gets me really, really down. Itaposs just heartbreaking since Iaposve learnt how people are, I feel like some people donapost like me because of my skin colour, she said. I donapost knowpeople are being . When people are being nice to my face are some of them also going home and saying these horrible things about me   In group conversations people sometimes stare at me and other times they wonapost even acknowledge me but they always talk to my partner. It just makes me feel like Iaposm a person as well, why canapost they speak to me the same  Sometimes itaposs just the way people are around me, keeping a distance, and Iaposm there thinking: aposDo I smell or something apos She also recalled situations where people had been hostile towards her and said based on her experiences she could only conclude it was because of the colour of her skin.  To think that in the st century this is still happening it appalling. I feel sick to my stomach. I think of people like my mother and grandmother when I see racism and what they and other people have experienced in their lives. Itaposs dehumanising and degrading, she said. At the end of the day weaposve all got red blood pumping through our veins. Itaposs not black, white, or any other colour of the rainbow. Itaposs red. Elizabeth had to be reintroduced to her two daughters – Sian, now , and Sarah,  – after her crash because she could not remember them.

The disturbing incident took place hours after he brutally attacked her in a jealous rage after she innocently hugged another man, she told the Mirror. She claims he repeatedly slammed her head against a wall in the ladies toilets of the Algarve bar where she worked - leaving her a bloodied mess. When the woman ed home she had a “horrible feeling” someone was inside and found Brueckner under her bed. The -year-old believes the German was lying in wait to attack hershe brought another man back to her studio flat. But instead Brueckner, then aged in his late s, chillingly stared at her and said “goodbye” before fleeing.  She said he then embarked on a stalking campaign against the petite barmaid, leaving her too afraid to walk home alone. Portuguese police were twice called out to deal with Brueckner after she complained of the attack and stalking - but he was never charged. The  break-in has eery similarities with Madeleine’s disappearance two years later in nearby Praia da Luz, where he was living. Gerry McCann previously said he believed her abductor was hiding behind a door when he went to check on her. Investigators believe the person who took Madeleine broke into their holiday apartment through a window. The woman, who is still too scared of Brueckner to reveal her identity, today reveals her account of her relationship with the Madeleine suspect.  She tells the Mirror how the German: • Seduced her when they worked together waiting tables in an Algarve restaurant. • Flew into jealous rages when other men paid her attention or even spoke to her. • Branded her a “lazy Brit” when she refused his demands to clean his house. • Chillingly broke into her flat through an open window and hid under the bed after a bust-up. • Now believes her ex, who is in a German prison, could be responsible for Madeleine’s abduction. She said: “Until now I’ve refused to believe someone I was involved with could commit such a horrible and disgusting thing like hurting a child. “But I’m not sure anymore. I’m starting to wonderhe did do it. Andhe did, he needs to be really punished for it.  “It’s chilling to think my ex is suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann. I can’t cope with it.” The woman, from Berkshire, moved to the Algarve town of Lagos in late  after spending several years in the Netherlands. She landed a job in the Taberna de Lagos restaurant - now called Sal e Companhia - alongside Brueckner, a waiter who was two years her junior. “At first I didn’t actually like him that much,” she recalled in a softly-spoken southern accent. “Not for any reason, I just didn’t like him. “I was , he was a couple of years younger than me. Everyone called him Chris. “He liked me, I knew he liked me in ‘that’ way but I wasn’t interested. We slowly became friends in the spring of . “Chris could be very, very charming, very funny and very smooth in the way he talked. “He always dressed nicely, holding the door open for women, that kind of thing. “I was alone here in Portugal, no family around and a bit lonely and I was getting all this attention from this guy. “We got together romantically and at first it was great. The relationship was very nice.” The woman stayed over regularly at Brueckner’s rented farmhouse on the outskirts of Praia da Luz, less than a mile from the Ocean Club.  “I was living in a little flat by myself on the same road as the restaurant where we worked,” she said. “He was living in Luz in the house that has been on the news all week. He was living on his own. “He wasn’t sleazy in the beginning, he was very charming, even chivalrous. “He drove the nice car - the black Jaguar - and was very gentlemanly and spoke properly. “Our sex le was normal. He wasn’t into anything weird with me. “We used to go out to eat a lot. He wasn’t a veggie. He liked to eat Indian food. “He also liked German food. I remember in his house once he made strange German food that I didn’t like at all. “He liked taking me to the beach. He didn’t like the town beach in Lagos. It would always be the West coast beaches, the isolated ones. “He liked those because he didn’t like lots of crowds, that’s what he said. He didn’t like all the tourists in the summer. “At first he seemed very easy-going, very relaxed, but gradually after summer things changed. “During the summer it was good, but during the winter it started to get not so good.” Her first inkling that things were not right came when she bumped into a male friend in Lagos in late .  “We were chatting and suddenly he stopped talking to me, like he was spooked or suddenly remembered something,” she said. “Someone later told me Christian had previously threatened the guy because he’d seen us speaking before. “We also started to argue in the late autumn, early winter. “It would be small things. He would get angry about really small things and I would get upset. “I remember he lost it once because I didn’t clean his house. I said ‘I’ve got my own house to clean, I don’t live here.’ “He was like, ‘You should clean my house, you’re a woman’. “He said he had two Portuguese girlfriends before me and they both cleaned his house even though they never lived there. “I remember saying, ‘but I’m not Portuguese’, and he replied saying ‘English women are all lazy’. “He said he had seen an English girl for a little while and she was lazy like me. “He called her Carol, I think it was only for a few weeks, she was on holiday and they had a fling. “He started to get possessive but it wasn’t to my face, it was behind my back.  “He also began going back and forwards to Germany over that time. He’d stay one week in Germany, then back to Portugal. “I remember feeling suspicious, like something strange was going on, so I looked at his phone. “I found messages in German from someone called ‘B’ saying ‘Ich liebe dich’ - I love you. “It was a German number, and obviously he had been going back and forth to Germany, so I put two and two together. “I confronted him about those and he went crazy, completely crazy. We had a huge fight.” Worse was to come weeks later when Brueckner flew into his jealous rage at theBar - now called Little Breakfast - in the early hours of New Year’s Day. “I started New Year’s Eve working in Taberna de Lagos and then after midnight I worked at another bar,” she recalled. “Chris was at the bar and was drunk. “Some really nice guys I’d made friends with came in from the bar next door to say happy New Year and gave me a hug. “Chris just suddenly came round the bar in a crazy rage and dragged me out in front of everybody. “He grabbed me by the neck, pulled me into the girls toilets and was ramming my head against the wall. “There were people pulling him off me, I think it took four big guys to get him off me.  “They called the police and some officers came. I was on the floor and couldn’t move because I was in shock. “I didn’t talk to the police because I was scared of what he would doit meant he got arrested. “The police soon left after I said I didn’t want to deal with them. “I stayed there the rest of the night recovering and eventually two friends, a guy and his girlfriend, walked me back to my flat. “I went through the security gate and up two flights of stairs, into my flat and closed the door. “Something was really strange inside there. It’s hard to explain, something just felt strange. “I went into the bathroom and the toilet seat was up. I always put the toilet seat down, it’s what I do, so it was another clue. “I was sure someone was either in there or had been in there. “I started looking in the cupboards and then thought I’d check under the bed. “I peeked under and got the shock of my le. He was hiding under there, lying on his back, staring at me. “Can you imagine how that felt  I just froze. I didn’t know what he was going to do to me. “He got out from under the bed, acted like everything was normal, said goodbye to me, walked out and closed the door behind him. “I was there all alone, just shaking and shaking. “I think he was there waiting to see whether I brought anyone home with me. “To this day I still wonder what would have happenedI had brought someone back that night.  “I think, from the previous behaviour, he would have really, really hurt that person and me too.” Despite the vicious beating and break-in, she enraged her friends by rekindling their relationship weeks later. “A lot of people were very, very angry that I went back to him after what had happened on New Year’s Eve,” she admitted. “He begged for my forgiveness, saying he lost control because he was drunk and would not drink again. “He wasn’t a big drinker when we were together, so stupidly I believed him and we got back together with him. “But it was never the same.” The final straw came in mid- when she found women’s underwear in a bag belonging to Brueckner. “I found a pair of knickers that weren’t mine and I got really, really upset about that,” she said. “I confronted him about it at his place and again he went totally crazy. “He drove me back to Lagos. I got out of his car and that was it as far as I was concerned.” But Brueckner had other ideas and began stalking his ex and staking out the restaurant where she worked. “We had to call the police because he kept trying to get in,” she said. “He was stalking me constantly. “One day I was carrying a big tray of drinks and because I wouldn’t talk to him he knocked them out of my hand and they went everywhere. “The police were called and he was banned from coming inside.  “So he would wait outside and follow me. Sometimes it would be begging me to go back with him. “But other times it would be him threatening me or saying I’m going to find out where your parents are and do something to them. “People had to walk me home each night. There was someone each night. Eventually it stopped but it went on for a long while.” She told how Brueckner had a string of ‘relationships’ with older women that led her to believe he could be a gigolo. “There was one lady he used to take out to dinner sometimes, she was a bit older, and he said it was just for company,” she said. “There was another lady, she was much older and I think there may have been something going on between them. “He used to walk her dog and clean her apartment - at least that’s what he told me - and she gave him money for that. “She lived in the centre of town. He took me to her house a couple of times, to see her dog. “He used to go to people’s houses a lot, saying he was going to visit this person and that person. “But the more I think about it the more I wonder what  he was doing. “At the end of the day I never found out who the other underwear belonged to, or who ‘B’ was. “A friend of mine said to me she wonderedhe was some sort of gigolo, doing things for money with older women. “Looking back on it maybe I was very, very naive at that time. I was a lot younger, a lot more impressionable.” The woman moved on with her le but was stunned to get a visit from Portuguese police officers last year. They quizzed her about a rape Brueckner carried out on an American pensioner in Praia da Luz in , shortly after they split. But they never mentioned the Madeleine McCann investigation - even though British and German police already suspected his involvement. “I remember the Madeleine case. I remember being here in Portugal when it happened,” she said. “At first I thought they would find her, but they didn’t and then it became bigger and bigger. “The Portuguese police have spoken to me three times in the past year, but never once did they say it was about Madeleine. “They said it was about him, they were investigating him because they had found out he had raped an old lady in Luz in . “They wanted to know all about him. But I had no idea it was to do with Madeleine also. “They asked me what the relationship was like, what the sex le was like, how he treated me, how he treated women.

Sarah Churchill had a rapid heartbeat and shortness of breath at the end of February - when just  people had tested positive for coronavirus. But instead of getting a fever or persistent cough, incredibly painful rashes flared up on her hands and feet. At first doctors thought she might have blood cancer or even HIV and were left stumped when medical tests showed no ailments. Terried Sarah thought she was going to die and was scared she would leave her nine-year-old son Noah alone. Eventually, more than three months later, the -year-old was told she had contracted Covid- in late February. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Now Sarah wants to warn other Brits - who have suffered rashes - that they might have unknowingly got the deadly virus as well. It was pretty scary being told I might have HIV or blood cancer, she said. I really thought I would die. Itaposs been an emotional rollercoaster. The silver lining is that I havenapost got a le-threatening condition like blood cancer or hepatitis. But I still donapost know what damage has been done to my body. People could be Covid- positive, with no other symptoms, and have no idea. They could be spreading the virus, without knowing they have it. Sarah first felt ill at the end of February - weeks before Britain went into lockdown, and only around a dozen Covid- cases had been confirmed.  She says she got night sweats, a racing heartbeat and severe shortness of breath. Her GP put it down to the flu and she didnapost think anything  of it. However a week later, horrible red marks flared up on her hands, feet and nose. Her doctor was left gazumped and said he thought she was immunosuppressed. He thought Sarah might even have blood cancer or even suffer HIV. I just thought I was going to die, shocked Sarah said. It was so unusual I just thought thataposs it, my luck is up, Iaposm going to die of blood cancer.  My father died of cancer, and it brought all of the emotion back now. The mum-of-one had numerous blood tests, but the doctor was left astonished when the results came back normal. This was on March , and as time went on Sarahaposs rashes got more painful. Often she was unable to stand on the balls of her feet, or open drinks bottles. I looked like I had the plague, she said. Itaposs an incredibly painful condition, itaposs not pleasant at all.  Not even resting my hands or feet helped, it just got worse over time. She had more blood tests and consultations and eventually at the start of June a dermatology specialist told Sarah she had had Covid-. He said the lesions were consistent with symptoms experienced by some people who had the killer virus, and her bloodwork was the same. At least my symptoms finally made sense, Sarah said.

While sheaposs been making private video calls for her official duties and to keep in touch with loved ones, this is her first official one. As well as raising awareness of the important issue, she also gave people an idea of her lockdown le with Prince Philip at Windsor. For the call, she sat on a cream cream chair, dressed in a lovely colourful floral dress with a pearl necklace. The chair is placed in front of a white and cream sofa with a leaf pattern. Two vases of beautul flowers are placed on a table behind her, including a huge bouquet of white roses. The Queen loves photos, and always have several on display, and a few framed snaps can be seen in the background. While we canapost see what they are of, photos from inside her other homes tell us she likes to surround herself with pictures of her loved ones. At Buckingham Palace, the Queen has filled the room where she hosts meetings with pictures of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The Monarch gave another glimpse of her home at the start of lockdown when she shared a snap of her doing her weekly meeting with the Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the phone.It showed her sitting at a wooden desk, covered in papers and trinkets, and speaking on a cream phone.The Queen and Anne worked with the Carers Trust to set up the chat, focusing on the extra work theyaposve been doing since the coronavirus Covid- pandemic. Her Majesty, , told them: Iaposm very impressed by what you have achieved already. Right now in the UK  million people are caring unpaid for a frail, ill or disabled family member or friend. The Queen and The Princess Royal heard from Alex, Amna, Mary and Nadia, who are all the primary carers for family members, about the dferent roles that carers have to play, and the challenge of juggling their own physical and mental health with that of their loved ones. Nadia Taylor, , from London, cares full time for her mother, father, husband and daughter – who all live together, with her other child.  She said: The call was about  minutes and the Queen was on for about  minutes of that. She asked us all questions. We talked about how we are all coping in the current climate with Covid-. I explained to her how much more isolated carers are at the moment. Many don’t have laptops or tablets and feel very cut off. A lot of the appointments - doctors, hospitals etc - we need have been cancelled.  The Queen asked questions about how we all coped and called us extraordinary, which was very lovely. I felt a great sincerity coming from her, as well as the Princess Royal. I think she was trying to send a message that ‘I’m still here, I haven’t forgotten the nation and those most in need. Carers Trust provides support, services and recognition for anyone living with the challenges of caring, unpaid, for a family member or friend who is ill, frail, disabled or has mental health or addiction problems. Across the UK today it is estimated there are seven million carers supporting a loved one who is older, disabled or seriously ill.  That’s around one in  adults who care, unpaid, for family and friends, having given up employment. Gareth Howells CEO, said: The palace wanted to follow formal etiquette in that Her Majesty would be the last to come into a room and the first to leave. She was on the phone from just after  to just after  past. She was in the Oak Room at Windsor. It was amazing. There were definitely nerves, as you can imagine. For Her Majesty to join the call it added a level of intrigue, to make sure that we could make sure that we could find the most impactful stories we could.

The monument was set to be put into storage because of Baden-Powellaposs sympathy for Hitler. Officials in Poole, Dorset, had opted to move the controversial monument amid concerns it could be targeted by protesters. Anti-racism campaigners have called for statues of slave traders, colonialists and fascist sympathisers to be taken down following the killing of George Floyd in the US. But it has now been postponed after a large crowd gathered to repel workers from taking it away. Liberal Democrat-run Poole council said the statue of Baden-Powell would be put in storage after it is taken from its location on the quay of the seaside town. He had famously described Hitleraposs Mein Kampf as a wonderful book and praised the ideas put forward by the German fuhrer. Council leader Vikki Slade said: Whilst famed for the creation of the Scouts, we also recognise that there are some aspects of Robert Baden-Powellaposs le that are considered less worthy of commemoration. But the crowd had other ideas.  Former Queenaposs Scout Len Bannister, , who was guarding it this morning, said: If they want to knock this down - theyaposll have to knock me down first. He told ITV News: Itaposs absolutely crazy. Whoaposs it that actually wants to do it  Iaposll fight them off. Independent councillor Mark Howell told The Sun: The contractor was due to remove it on a temporary basis for itaposs own protection but they didnapost want to work in a media circus. It will not happen today. Tory MP Sir Robert Syms has also opposed the move, posting on Twitter :For the avoidance of doubt I am opposed to the permanent removal of the statue of Baden-Powell from Poole Quay. In a poll in , Baden-Powell was voted the th most influential person in the United Kingdom in the th century. But critics say he held racist views and was a supporter of Adolf Hitler and fascism. In  he wrote in his diary: “Lay up all day. Read Mein Kampf. “A wonderful book, with good ideas on education, health, propaganda, organisation etc.”  His statue, has been in place for about  years, currently looks across the harbour to Brownsea Island where he started the scout movement in . A spokesman for the Scouts said the organisation was looking forward to discussing the matter with the council to make an informed decision on what happens next. The Scout movement is resolute in its commitment to inclusion and ersity and members continually reflect and challenge ourselves in how we live our values, he said.  Statues across the UK are being looked at following anti-racism protests. On Sunday, protesters in Bristol pulled down a statue of th Century slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour.

Stuart Richie, , was fishing from a kayak in Luce Bay, near Ardwell in southwest Scotland, when he picked up a bite. But he barely had a chance to reel it in before a tope shark pounced on the catch and dragged it back to the deep, bending Stuart’s rod and snapping his line. “I had baited the light rod with a strip of mackerel to seethere was anything small around and hooked a dogfish,” he said. “When the dogfish broke the surface I immediately saw something behind it. I tried to pull the dogfish clear, but the shark was too fast and turned with a splash and grabbed it. “My rod bent as the shark tried to get away with the fish, and with a splash and final kick of its tail it snapped my line and was gone.” He continued: “It’s always a shock when you see a shark shape in the water, especially when you’re so close to it. “When it grabbed the fish I was shocked and just held on. I was praying that the GoPro was recording as no one would have believed me.” Tope sharks, also known as school sharks, can grow to be more than six feet long with a weight of over lbs. And they are far from picky about their diet, eating whatever is plentul in their environment. But it’s the first time that Stuart, a navigator with the merchant navy, has seen one feed in such a way.  “I’ve spent years at sea on ships travelling the world,” he said. “I have been kayak fishing for around five years and have kitted my kayak out with an echo sounder fish finder as well as an electric motor. “I have encountered these sharks before and they are one of my favourite species to catch.

William Callaghan went missing at Mount Disappointment in Victoria, Australia, on Monday, sparking a huge search for him. With temperatures around zero degrees, his loved ones feared the worst as he remained missing for  hours, especially as he was not wearing a big coat. Incredibly he was found alive on Wednesday - and his mum said William probably thought the drama was a bit of an adventure. Now a child psychologist who specialises in autism has said Williamaposs hypersensitivity could have been the key to his survival.Professor Robyn Young, from Flinders University, told news.au that many autistic children have a toughness that others do not - with many having a higher pain threshold.She said that helicopters flying above him would have upset him and he didnapost respond to his name, heightening the risk of him not being found. But she said there were several things protecting William. Prof Young said: “Much of them relate to hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity – basically they have a high pain threshold. “We’re not surethey don’t feel it or don’t respond to it but I’ve seen kids that have walked around with broken bones.”  She said she was confident he would be found, saying: “When they found him he wasn’t panicking, he was quite calm and smiling.”The teenager was discovered by walker Ben Gibbs, who had deviated off the trail for just  minutes, and cut his way through the vegetation, finding William just standing there.The teen was given a piece of chocolate and some warm socks by his rescuer, before Ben called for help. In a bid to keep the teen calm and relaxed as the pair waited for the rescue team together, Ben spoke to William about Bertie and Diesel from Thomas the Tank Engine.  More than  people, largely made of volunteers, had been searching the area around mountainaposs summit since the teen disappeared at around .pm on Monday. Ben said: He looked in reasonable health, he wasnapost shivering too bad, he didnapost have socks on so I put some socks on him and a jacket, and gave him some chocolate. I carried him, he was extremely light, and then eventually I could hear some of the other guys to signal for him.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold. On the football side, that means recruitment and day-to-day work with players.They are crucial to any club’s success.But McPake insists he – and everybody  at Dens Park who is not furloughed – is doing everything he can to ensure as seamless ato action as possible.“I speak to Johna couple of times a week or maybe more but nothing has really changed,” he said. “We are where we are and there is no definitive date to when we can start back. It is not like a normal summer or break in the season like a winter one or international break.“There is always a structure to football and when you are back. The players, staff, everybody knows that but at the moment that has completely gone.“It is everyone’s longest lay-off – we are now getting to the stage where the players have been off the same amount of timethey had a serious injury so that brings its problems physically and mentally.“It is just about trying to get everything right so that when we do get the green light to start back we are in as good a position as possible.”EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Dundee striker Peter MacDonald confirms he’s hanging up his boots and says best day of his career came as a Dark Blues player\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-peter-macdonald-retirement-st-johnstone-rangers embed # secretWJcMNsFIpT\" data-secret\"WJcMNsFIpT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They have a little heart and we encourage the children to speak to the bear and tell it what#s worrying them.#Danielle added: #Children will often play act and put on dferent voices and tell a story to the bear. In this way they are able to express their fears.#It is also a way for a parent to maybe overhear what their child is saying so that they can then address the issue at home.#Danielle told the Tele that the children missed their friends and would like to see their grandparents again.#One child told me that the world was sick and another said they wanted to hug their grandad,# she added.However, despite lockdown, it was surprising how well the children were coping.Danielle explained: #I think one thing we have learned is that children are very astute about what#s going on around them, often understanding things much more than we sometimes give them credit for.  They#re very resilient but that doesn#t mean they don#t worry.#She added: #They are definitely talking about the virus and realise it has made a big dference to their lives.#These children are our future generations so it#s very important that we help them to understand and to get through this dficult time.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

This is achieved by installing a large cylindrical passageway in the centre of a cage, from which tarpaulin hangs and protects salmon from lice infestations when they swim to the surface to fill their swim-bladders.At Port na Cro, the tarpaulin hangs to a m depth and the feeders are placed at m.Gareth Siney, farm manager at Port na Cro, said: #At the moment, we use lots of dferent tools to tackle sea lice such as water pressure and using cleaner fish that naturally pick the sea lice off our salmon.

of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind.

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding.

This would be counter-productive by making it easier for those in denial to ignore the fact that Scots were involved, in many cases far more successfully than their counterparts in England, in this despicable, inhuman trade. Far better to leave the statues and the street names, with the addition of a plaque to record their involvement, as a permanent reminder of a very dark period in this countrys history.TJ Dowds, Cumbernauld.I AGREE to a large extent with George Kaythat education has a key role in anti-racism. The anti-racist protesters we have seen in our cities over the last few days are misguided in my eyes as they only see black and white in the issue instead of the big picture, including the brother of racism ndash sectarianism. If the recent anti-racist actions of defacing history continue, then in  yearsrsquo time, slavery- deniers will emerge and say that black people made it all up.I feel that the demonstrators did not stop to understand that racism is only one facet of the issue of discrimination in the human psyche which is embedded in people early on in le so that they visualize the world and its people in binary form ndash us and them. It is perhaps a primal form of defence we are unable to shake off even after local tribalism and clan culture disappeared. Not only people are black and white but we talk daily about issues being ldquoblack and white, meaning there must be absoluteness in truths in our lives.We regularly hope that a rounded schooling will enlighten young people yet we condone our polarising education system which is too often about black and white right answer and wrong answer success and failure winners and losers top of the class and bottom of the class a hit or a miss. We can hardly expect young people to learn to be unassuming and non-judgmentalwe subject them to regular assessments to rate them competitively as good or bad learners.We will not stop racism without first stopping the practice of classying people.Bill Brown, Milngavie.I SHARE the views expressed by Gordon Casely . Many have reacted in support of the protests which have taken place in support of Black Lives Matter throughout the world. The fact that a minority resorted to violence only served to distract from the force of the protests.I wrote some months ago to make the point thatwe seek to revisit history in such a fashion and to apply todays moral standards, then why stop at slavery  Yes, it is true that figures such as Stirling and Cochrane in Glasgow made fortunes using slave labour. However, many other prominent figures in Glasgow made their fortunes during the Industrial Revolution on the backs of their workers, who toiled in dire conditions without proper wages and who lived in squalid and over-crowded housing. Let the whole story of exploitation be remembered.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.DISTASTEFUL as slavery in British plantations was, history cannot be changed. Just as it should not be forgotten, there is no case for the febrile revisionism currently being preached. If we truly learn from history we should perhaps be more circumspect about trading with countries where slavery is still a fact of le. Such as China.But we will continue to appease China and turn a blind eye because we demand cheap consumer goods just as we once craved sugar and tobacco. Instead of mob vandalism might it not be more constructive to challenge the sourcing of some of todayrsquos biggest consumer companies in the world John Dunlop, Ayr.IN the understandable fury arising from the unjustiable killing of George Floyd, who was admittedly no saint, by a law enforcement officer, we have clearly witnessed global demonstrations against the prejudice ingrained in the American psyche which has claimed yet another victim. However, when emotion is unleashed in the actions of looting, violence and the destruction of statues, the rule of law and the primacy of reason are replaced by an ungovernable populist vigilantism.If society is to regain its stability, all must accept that emotion must not overpower the central pivot reason plays in the governance of the state.Righteous indignation should not be reflected through major civil disturbances but should harness the process of law to right the wrongs prevalent in the distortion of perspective created by misguided historical precedent, motivated by self-interest.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.Read more: Letters: We canrsquot rewrite history, but we can make the present better"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-needs-called-account-profligate-spending","story":"How much is that per person  Where exactly does it go  These funds come from taxpayers, either iniduals or corporations throughout the entire UK, but the SNP has successfully broken the link between services and taxation in Scotland now. There are many people who believe that most of their services, support, and medication are delivered at no cost, magically appearing from the ether like manna from heaven.They are not costings are just pushed along vertically or horizontally. There are economic, social and environmental limits to everything, except in Scotland apparently.Surely such profligate spending in Scotland by the SNP needs more attention at the moment, not just to refute the SNPrsquos vision of a \"milk and honey\" independent Scotland but for taxpayers across the UK.David Bone, Girvan.MAY I answer the question put by Liz Galbraithregarding how an independent Scotland would pay for the current crisis An independent Scotland with its own National Bank would do exactly as all other independent countries have done and are doing ndash borrow from their own National Bank, a debt incurred which would never need repaid, as they own that bank. It is simply a strategy for printing money and increasing the supply within the economy, and that is exactly what Westminster is doing.As things stand, as part of the UK, Scotland is not allowed to borrow a single penny from anyone, nor is it allowed to overspend its budget. In fact, it is legally obliged not to spend all its budget, but must end every financial year with a surplus. It is therefore prevented by our membership of the UK from dealing with this crisis as all independent countries around the world are able to. The value of oil, or anything , is totally irrelevant.P Davidson, Falkirk.I NOTE the letter from Liz Galbraith in respect of dferences between New Zealand and Scotland and \"extreme financial challenges\". I quickly checked a few things and found that GDP per capita in both countries are broadly similar, that Scotland has slightly more people, New Zealand has more land. So how will New Zealand handle those challenges given that they are not any wealthier than Scotland I submit the dference in performance is a combination of constitutional dferences and powers with, perhaps, the luck to have an exceptional leader at the time of crisis. Of course, Scotland may also have had an exceptional leader in Nicola Sturgeon, but without the kind of constitutional powers that Jacinda Ardern has, we may never know.Iain Cope, Glasgow G.RUTH Marrand others are indulging in a fallacy in their assertions that \" Scotland was independent...\" with regard to the current Covid- pandemic. There is no comparison to be made between Scotland and New Zealand, not least because the latter is an archipelago so biologically remote from the rest of the world and anomalous that it had no terrestrial mammals at all until the Polynesians arrived in the th century.What is more, Scotland voted to stay in the UK in . The choice of two million Scots was the preference for the risks and responsibilities of being part of bigger and more erse country and economy over those of being part of a smaller and narrower one. If we want to play Ms Marrs parlour game and pretend that something  happened, we can also imagine the penury that Scotland would have faced following the greatest economic shock in its history, and wonder how on earth we would have managed with public services stripped of over pound billion every year.Such speculation is all very entertaining, and makes useful material for the attempts of nationalists to distract us from the failings of the SNP Scottish Government. But Scotland is not New Zealand. Nor Norway nor Denmark nor the Republic of Ireland. Nor in terms of responsibility for public health and the NHS and care homes, is it even England.In the real world, we can only judge Nicola Sturgeon and Jeane Freeman and co by the actions and decisions they have taken, and have failed to take, and above all by the Covid- infection rate and death toll in Scotland.

Apart from meeting family and friends, top of the list was going for a coffee, closely followed by a day in the library. If to this could be added an early evening drink in the pub, possibly planning our next trip to Italy, I would ask nothing more. What a thrilling lestyle, you must be thinking. Yet Irsquom probably not alone, during these eerily frozen weeks, in realising how narrow and predictable the margins of my le are, and happily so.They say it takes six weeks to form a habit, so perhaps we will get used to the protocols protecting us when we enter the classroom, or train, or go shopping for clothes. It might become second nature to dine behind plastic screens on the bistro table, or to stay three steps away from our nearest and dearest, even in their own homes.

To expect to gather in a cafe as we used to, drawing up chairs to crowd around a table, is to day-dream. Almost nothing will be the same as in the good old days, or at least not at first. In the months ahead we will either have to accustom ourselves to new and uncomfortable regulations and rules, or stay housebound.Therersquos little doubt, though, that seeing the ties that bind us being slowly slackened is a huge psychological boost.

If there was a button marked ldquoreset, many millions of Americans might rush to press it. Erase the last four years, months, weeks, days, hours. Restore Americarsquos factory settings, because something has gone catastrophically awry.The duff sloganeering was not the worst offence the President committed on Twitter. By many a mile that title went to his musings on Martin Gugino, the -year-old who was shoved by police during a protest in Buffalo, New York, over the death of George Floyd.Mr Gugino fell, cracking his head, and as his blood poured on to the pavement the police walked on by. The incident was captured on video. Two policeman have been charged.The presidentrsquos take on this  Mr Gugino ldquocould be a hard left ldquoprovocateur who was carrying a scanner to block out police communications . ldquoI watched, said Mr Trump. ldquohe fell harder than he was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up Mr Guginorsquos lawyer called this a ldquoa dark, dangerous and untrue accusation. If you wanted a response red hot with fury one could turn to Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of New York. He thought nothing the President might say on Twitter could surprise him any more. He was wrong. ldquoHow reckless, he said of the Gugino accusation. ldquoHow irresponsible. How mean. How crude. If there was ever a reprehensible, dumb comment hellip and this from the President of the US. Earlier, Mr Cuomo summed up the bewilderment of many when he asked simply, ldquoHow did we get to this place Good question, depressing answers. The appalling treatment of African-Americans did not start with Mr Trump. Nor was he responsible for a virus that has cruelly laid bare the failings of the country, not least in healthcare, and the inequalities that persist.: Letters - leave the statuesBut as the President that famous buck has to stop with him. It would be a test of even the greatest American leader at any time. One can only wonder what a Johnson, or an FDR, would do. That it falls to Mr Trump to act, and in an election year, lays the ground for troubled times to come.It has been a politically disastrous couple of weeks for the President. The events and images have been shocking. A man dying in the street at the hands of police. Peaceful protestors being tear-gassed and beaten so their commander-in-chief could walk from the White House and hold a bible aloft. A security fence erected in front of the White House, something that was not necessary during the worst civil unrest of the s. Threatening to use soldiers against lawful protesters, and being castigated by a former Defence Secretary for doing so. Tales of a president fleeing to a White House bunker. All of it dreadful, much of it used against America by its opponents.Even Mr Trump, a man who never met a setback he did not try to spin, has had trouble ignoring the plummeting poll ratings that have resulted. In a CNN poll published on Monday, % disapproved of his performance as president, with % approving. Those are the kind of numbers Jimmy Carter and fellow one term President George HW Bush racked up.Overall, the incumbent is  points behind his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. In what should be further cause for alarm, Mr Trumprsquos support among white voters without degrees is falling, and his problem with women has grown worse. In  he was  points behind with women voters. A recent poll put him  points behind.As ever with the defensive Mr Trump, his instinct is to go on the attack. That could signal more sackings, more likely it will mean getting back on the rally circuit, the place he feels comfortable and wanted.His supporters argue the Black Lives Matter protests, which brought hundreds of thousands on to the streets, are a green light for the Trump rallies to restart. The president has suggested the first event could even be as soon as next week. This at a time when , Americans have died from Covid-, and when the White House infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has warned the pandemic ldquoisnrsquot over yet.: The truth about Scotlands slaving pastJust when the US might benefit from devoting its considerable energies into tackling its policing and race relations crises, or even simply pausing for a period of reflection after a dreadful start to the year, the President will in effect be firing the starting gun in the race to the White House.Judging by their advertising, both sides will be using the recent protests to boost their arguments. Mr Trump knows it worked for Richard Nixon in , but he was not the incumbent. It is a tactic fraught with danger in as much as it risks fuelling further tension and ision, the last thing the country needs.We know from past experience the kind of candidate Mr Trump becomes when he fronts one of his rallies. Crowds chanting for Hillary Clinton to be locked up, the mocking of a disabled reporter, the harassment of the press his rallies in the run up to the  election set a sour tone for his presidency from the off. Who will be the scapegoats this time Mr Trump could do with some wise counsel at this point, but that looks in desperately short supply, not least from his own party. Too many Republican candidates are afraid to criticise Mr Trump lest his base turns against them. But as of now he has shown himself unwilling to listen to anyone .Whatever campaign slogan he settles on, Mr Trump will doubtless position himself as the man to save America.

If Scottish Labour wanted the endorsement of a home-grown celebrity they could not have done better than the former shipyard worker.But the way they went about it put Connolly off political parties for le.ldquoI used to be a Labour man, says Sir Billy in an interview for the six-part series which ends next week.The film cuts to a Labour PPB in which a young, long-haired Connolly is sitting at a window in a Glasgow flat. He is talking to someone who is off camera, ashe is being interviewed. ldquoAs far as Irsquom concerned every other party represents selfishness, he says. ldquoBasically, itrsquos fairness Irsquom looking for. The picture fades and the slogan ldquoScotland will win with Labour appears.ldquoI was kind of conned into it, says Connolly now. ldquoI was asked to come up to a meeting I might find interesting. I went, I didnrsquot find it interesting, but somebody asked me a question, I answered and I suddenly discovered I was on the [party political broadcast]. So you wonrsquot find me very near political people now.He also recalls meeting an unnamed Scottish Labour politician.ldquoSome woman, from Anderston, where I was born. She was born there too. She started to try to lsquoout slumrsquo me, saying my slum was worse than your slum. That thing Labour politicians do. I find it pathetic.Connolly has long lampooned notions of Scottishness, nationalism, and patriotism in general. In the  referendum he refused to back Yes, saying he was ldquodeeply suspicious of patriotism. The Brexit vote seemed to change the pro-European Connollyrsquos mind. Last year, when askedhe would like to see Scotland independent, he replied: ldquoI donrsquot know. If Scotland would like it, I would like it.Billy and Us finds the now retired stand-up still performing a dance of the seven veils on independence, but he seems to inch further towards it than ever before.Insisting that his politics change ldquodaily, he says: ldquoIrsquove never liked nationalism in any of its guises. Irsquom not saying Irsquove never agreed with independence. I think a Scottish republic is as good an idea as any I ever heard. But I donrsquot represent anybody, or anything. I donrsquot think itrsquos wise to.Connolly, diagnosed with Parkinsonrsquos seven years ago, addresses class and ldquonever letting yourself be put into a box marked lsquoworking classrsquo or lsquoScottishrsquo or anything  that limits who you are or what you can say.His own introduction to class dferences came when he was a scout and it was bob-a-job week. He went from his home in working class Partick to the West End, where a woman asked him to go to the cellar and bring back some ldquoanthracite.ldquoThere was only coal there, he says, laughing. ldquoI thought God, they even have dferent names for coal up here. Theyrsquore dferent from us.Connolly, born in a room and kitchen, went on to become the owner of a stately home in Scotland, the -bedroomed Candacraig House in Strathdon. His celebrity friends, and his playing the laird at the Lonach Highland Games, where he entertained guests including Prince Charles, Steve Martin and the late Robin Williams, led to criticism that he was forgetting his working class roots.Though the programme never asks him about the celebrity circuit directly, he says: ldquoIrsquod be invited to dinners, Irsquod turn up and have a good laugh. But I never wanted to be part of it. Itrsquos just not my cup of tea.The concept of class continues to fascinate and repel him. Some find comfort from thinking people are beneath them, he says.ldquoYou see it acted out even in the working class when they look at some poor immigrant and think hersquos below them and they feel quite jolly about that.

Looking at excess death rates, more than , people have died at this time this year compared to the same time last year.When asked what had gone wrong, Prof Ferguson said: ldquoI think two things ndash one is a paper actually out in Nature, which highlights that around about that time, just before lockdown happened, the first two weeks of March, we probably had , to , infections imported from Italy and Spain, which we just hadnrsquot seen in the surveillance data, until that point.ldquoSo there is much heavier seeding than wersquod expected.He added: ldquoThe key things to determine number of deaths is at what point in your local epidemic you trigger interventions ndash how far in are you when you shut down transmission.ldquoAnd we frankly had underestimated how far into the epidemic this country was, thatrsquos half the reason.ldquoThe second part, which I think would have been more avoidable, is about half of those deaths occurred in care homes.Prof Ferguson continued: ldquoAnd we did all this working under the assumption which was Government policy at the time that care homes would be shielded from infection.He further told the committee: ldquoWe also made a rather optimistic assumption that somehow ndash which was policy ndash that the elderly would be shielded, the most vulnerable would be shielded as the top priority. And that simply failed to happen.Prof Ferguson, whose research helped usher in the lockdown, resigned from his role as a key Government adviser after admitting that he had undermined social distancing rules by reportedly meeting a woman at his home.However, he told the committee he still sits on SPI-M, which advises the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies .Prof Ferguson told the committee that despite border screening at the early stage of the pandemic, probably % of cases imported into the country were missed because checks were not being conducted on people arriving from Europe.Greg Clark, chairman of the committee, asked Prof Fergusonthat was because Sage had advised that it was not necessary to test those people.Prof Ferguson said: ldquoThis is really decisions by the Foreign Office and by the Department of Health and Social Care, not by Sage.ldquoSage recommended that where a country had been identied as having an active transmission, we should check travellers from those countries.He added that the dficulty was that Spain and Italy ndash the source of many infections into the UK ndash had large epidemics before they realised.ldquoWe were just not aware of the scale of transmission in Europe as a whole, Prof Ferguson said.The committee also heard that had the UK had the testing capacity at that stage, then at least screening everybody with symptoms arriving in the country would have given a better impression of where infection was coming from.:Scotlands tourism industry, pubs and restaurants set to re-open for business on July The Imperial College Covid- response team called for a full-scale lockdown in a paper on March  ndash seven days before it was implemented in the UK.When askedhe was disappointed in the delay, Prof Ferguson said: ldquoI said earlier, but in retrospect I would have much preferred it to have been taken a week earlier given that many lives would have been saved.Prof Fergusonrsquos comments were put to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty at the daily Downing Street press conference.Sir Patrick said it would be important to look back and see what measures had been most effective, and would be useful in determining what measures to implement in the future,necessary.He added: ldquoSo I think those are important scientic questions to address, and they havenrsquot yet been fully addressed.Prof Whitty said it was important to learn lessons from what had happened in the outbreak.ldquoI think a iety of dferent people are going to come

Covid-, was between . and ., down from . to . the previous week.However the numbers have not yet factored in the easing of the lockdown on May , when thousands met other households outdoors, took a drive, and played non-contact sports.At the daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon said the latest estimates appeared to be more accurate than earlier ones, which may have over-estimated the pool of infectious cases in Scotland.She also announced a further five people had died overnight, taking the number of laboratory confirmed fatalities to ,.However the total for confirmed and suspected Codi deaths is put at more than .Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoThese latest estimates reflect the encouraging data that weve seen in the last couple of weeks and there is no doubt in looking at all of this data that we are making very real progress in combating and suppressing the virus.\"She announced the construction industry in Scotland would be able to move into the next stage of its reopening plan, with workers gradually be able toto building sites, provided they adhered to hand hygiene and social distancing measures.This is intended to allow for a slow build-up of workforces to optimum capacity.Work on ldquonon-essential sites can only be carried out with physical distancing.The First Minister said the construction industry move was in line with the timing set out in the Scottish

Ms Sturgeon said the Governmentrsquos plan for continued physical distancing remained in place for now, though she \"totally understands the frustrations people have\".She said: \"If we are to come

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

It’s baffling, therefore, that the Minister in charge of financing our response to the Covid- pandemic, seems to have a view at odds with most other countries in Europe and the scientic community.Public messaging during a health crisis is important and, on this occasion, it seems to have gone wrong again.Read MoreLisa Smyth:Opinion Swann takes first steps to ensuring a healthy future for our ailing NHSMr Swann has in the past blamed Stormont for running down the health system to an extent a scramble was necessary to find the capacity to cope with the virus.“Vital services have been underfunded, short-term decisions were preferred over long-term planning, dficult choices were ducked, staff were left to feel unappreciated, social care was particularly neglected,” Mr Swann told MLAs in May.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill, a former health minister, responded by accusing the Conservative government of having “stripped the Executive of funding over  years”.“The impact that’s had on our health service and our public services are well rehearsed and well known to everybody. Even the fact and the condition that we were in as a health service to be able to respond to Covid- was greatly diminished because of the impact of Tory austerity over many, many years,” she said.Belfast Related ContentNews Analysis PremiumLisa SmythOpinionSwann takes first steps to ensuring a healthy future for our ailing NHSWhen Robin Swann took the job of Health Minister in January, it was dficult to imagine he could face a greater challenge than addressing Northern Ireland#s hospital waiting list shame.GalleryNorthern IrelandRevealed: Blueprint for post-Covid healthcare in Northern IrelandRobin Swann has published his plan for rebuilding the health service in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Education Minister sets target date of August  for some pupils to go back to schoolFuneral of Liam Neeson#s mother Kitty held in BallymenaAlex KaneOpinionMurphy#s new law: Saying wrong thing at the wrong timeMan taken to hospital after falling ft from clf in PortstewartNI Finance Minister Murphy tweets #clarication# on coronavirus preventable lockdown claim,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Therefore the aim remains ato full-time classroom education as soon as medical guidance allows this.The department has now established a Restart Programme, with both the minister and the department set to consult with a wide range of stakeholders.

They also praised the important contribution of the NI Bureau and Invest NI in China in developing the supply line.

I am pleased to confirm that the reports on the new consignment are positive in this regard.” Minister Murphy:“Establishing a supply line with China, in the face of signicant international competition forPPE, is a signicant achievement for the Executive. This has been made possible by the collaborative efforts of the procurement teams in Health and Finance along with the Bureau in China. “At the same time as opening up a supply line with China, it is important to ramp up local supply ofPPE. Many companies have already repurposed their operations and this should be expanded to provide security of supply and create employment as we move towards economic recovery.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On Friday, the GAA released theirto action procedures, that will allow collective training from Monday, July  and competitive games to commence  days later. There has been mixed reaction over the weekend, due to safety, the ious procedures clubs would need to enforce including the appointment of a Covid Supervisor and Health Questionnaires to be completed for any activity. The County Derry Post conducted an anonymous survey yesterday with adult club players across all codes. googletag.cmd.push Over  responses – from  dferent clubs - were received, with  percent stating they had not read the extensive document outlining the guidelines for ato play. When askedthey wouldto games on July ,  percent indicating that they would do so. Eight percent said they wouldnt, with the reminder said they were unsure. The figures are almost the same for theto training date of Monday, July , with  percent of players saying they will, with  indicating they wont and rest are undecided. Some of the reasons given ranged from not being convinced social distancing would be feasible, working on the front line and the risk it would be to both themselves and their families. googletag.cmd.push One response said that amateur players should not be playing during a global pandemic. The final question on the survey was directed at one of the greatest talking points in recent weeks, whether the GAA shouldve wiped out the entire season. Of the replies,  percent felt the season shouldve been cancelled,  percent had the view that county activity should cease to allow clubs a better window. The remainderwere content with the GAAs stance. Ballerin manager Brian Deighan commended the GAA for their handling of the lockdown, but felt there was now an element of rush with an element of risk. He admits that there is a dference of opinion within his squad, which never exceeds  players. “The younger lads dont see the risk, but older lads in certain jobs or with family members in certain jobs arent keen on it . As a management team, we are dead against it...it is either safe to play or it isnt.” Brian continues by pointing to a comment he saw on social media over the weekend. “Mickey Donnelly hit the nail on the head with a tweet at the weekend, a small club will struggle to resource all these protocols and tests.” Derry CCC are set to finalise their club championship arrangements this week, following meetings to explore the options. Nothing has been confirmed, but they structures are likely to change to allow club players at least one championship game. RELATED - The GAAsto action explained. More...

When Dungiven woman Bridie Ward sent us a s image of men lined up by soldiers outside a bar on Belfastrsquos New Lodge Road, it begged further investigation. Liam Tunney caught up with her to find out its background.The sight of men spread-eagled on the wall of a bar while soldiers search a premise is one that evokes strong emotions in this country. The Starry Plough sat halfway down the New Lodge Road in north Belfast, but was owned and run for years by Dungiven man Jim O’Kane. Although a staunchly Republican area, Jim’s sister Bridie recalled a mixed crowd at the bar in its earlier days. “There was a mixed crowd away years ago, it was a bar where everyone would meet up. People from Tiger’s Bay would have come in there before the Troubles started,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Before the Troubles, the sea men, or the dockers, would have been in the bar. They were away at sea for maybe six weeks at a time and they had all this money so they spent it in there. “At the beginning, he made a lot of money in the bar, because when he bought it, there were always darts matches in it.” By the time the Troubles began to poison the city, though, the bar was singled out on a few occasions by the British Army. ‘Times of Troubles’, by Andrew Saunders, describes how, on one of those occasions, the bar was raided following a period of rioting. googletag.cmd.push “On the night of  May one platoon went into the Starry Plough to make arrests,” it read. “They removed thirty people for questioning and felt sufficiently threatened by the crowd which had gathered outside that they fired rubber bullets.” The bar has been rebuilt and is now named The Lodge. The Starry Plough’s owner Jim was a Republican Labour councillor in the city and his position attracted unwanted attention that regularly escalated into a physical threat. He twice survived attempts on his le, attempts that tragically resulted in the deaths of two companions, including a doorman at the bar in the s. North Belfast historian, Joe Baker, recalled the aftermath of the bomb in an article he wrote for the North Belfast News. “I remember my mother running to it screaming after it was bombed by Loyalists,” it read. “She knew that my Dad had been in it but fortunately he had left some time before to head off to another bar.” Another attack, in , on Jim’s home in Cedar Avenue resulted in the death of Bridget Breen, a -year-old woman who was babysitting for the O’Kane family. “Jim lived up there most of his le and was married up there. They had a hard time during the Troubles, it was tough in the s up there,” she recalled. Jim OKane outside the Starry Plough in the aftermath of the bomb that killed a doorman. “During the Troubles, they planted a bomb in the entrance [of the bar] and it blew up. He survived, but the door man was killed. “He also lost two homes. He lived in a beautul house, but they burned him out. They threw a firebomb in and the four boys were very lucky to survive. “The boys were sleeping one night and there was a woman who used to babysit for him. Josie, his we, was going down that evening to help out in the bar. “The phone rang a couple of times and the first time before she went out, it rang and they said, in an English tongue, ‘Oh sorry, we got the wrong number’, so they must have been looking for my brother. “He would have come home at night to have his tea or dinner and went back to the bar. She was ready to go out again and the call came through again, but they put the phone down on her. “She went on to the bar and the babysitter came in. It was one of those old houses, a big red brick house, with a front room like a sitting room at the front and a big long hall. “They threw the duffle bag with the bomb in through the front room, breaking the window. “The babysitter panicked and ran out the front door. It was the big, huge, oak door that was on the front and it fell on her and killed her. “The boys survived because the house was so big that it was just the front that got demolished and they were sleeping away at the back.” Jim died in the s, but an off-licence bearing the family name remains in place on the New Lodge Road. The effects of the bomb attacks and threats on his le left a lasting impression on the Dungiven man. “He never really got over the babysitter or the doorman,” said Bridie. “After that, when he was going down to the bar, and especially coming home at night, he always made sure he checked his car, in case they planted something on it. It was a scary time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The  on the bridge were vandalised in July  and have still to be replaced. The Department of Infrstructure , which is responsible for the maintenance of the bridge, said in October of last year that it had planned to have new  in place by the end of November. However, that work has not been carried out. Last years vandalism was the latest in a series of attacks on the glass  on the Peace Bridge, which opened in  and is used by hundreds of people each day. googletag.cmd.push The delay in repairing the damage caused by the latest attack was discussed yesterday at a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. During the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the council had recently received a letter from the Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon which stated that the repair work was to be carried out on the bridge. However, he said that the work had not yet been carried out and asked that another letter be sent to the Minister. He said that they should not let the Peace Bridge repairs slip off the agenda. googletag.cmd.push A council officer told the meeting that she would follow the issue up with the Divisional Roads Manager as it was their department who would be undertaking the bridge repairs. The officer said she was aware that they had appointed a contractor to carry out the work before the coronavirus crisis, and that it may have been the pandemic which had delayed the work being carried out. She said thatcouncillors agreed she would contact the Divisional Roads Manager to find out what the situation was. The officer added thatthere was any issue or delay, then the council could then write to the Minister about the bridge repairs.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk has called for the meetings to be made more widely available. “I am confident the technology exists to open meetings up to the public and hope to see it rolled out in the very near future,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “The draft protocol called for any member of the public wishing to access council meetings to register their request with the Democratic Services team and a link would then be provided for access to the meeting. “I argued that this created unnecessary barriers to the public and meetings should simply be broadcast via a link from the council’s website. “This would open up council business for greater scrutiny from the public and perhaps attract a new audience for council meetings. This can only be a positive for democracy at local government level. “I would encourage anyone interested in remotely accessing a council meeting to get in touch with Democratic Services and get registered.” googletag.cmd.push Anyone wishing to join a council meeting should email sinead.duggan@causewaycoastandglens.gov.uk.

A student at St Patrick’s College, Maghera, Luca’s story ‘Business Crocodile’ was selected as a finalist in the - category of the BBC’s ‘Two Minute Tales’ competition. Luca’s father, Michael, said his son was taking the achievement in his stride. “He doesn’t like the limelight, but he’s quietly delighted in himself,” he told the County Derry Post. “Luca is laid back, very laid back, and he hates any sort of people looking at him. He would be quite happy for someone to say, ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’ and move on. googletag.cmd.push “He’s very non-assuming. Even when he scores goals in football, he doesn’t make a fuss.” Michael suggested Luca enter the competition after hearing about it on the Nuala McKeever show, and when the school added it to their homework tasks, it was the perfect fit. The Year  student’s love for animals formed the basis of his story, and although very imaginative, it has taken this success to spur him into action. “It’s come out of nowhere really, but he is full of imagination and he comes up with these quirky things from time to time. His teachers, Ms McAteer and Ms Laverty, have to take the credit. googletag.cmd.push “This has given him a boost and he’s started jotting down new characters and thinking of new stories on the back of it. “His mind is an encyclopaedia. He could rhyme off reams of animals and their Latin names as well. He reads about them and the dferent species, so the character probably came from that.” For now, the content of the story is a closely guarded secret around Maghera, but it will not remain that way for long. The finalists will now have their stories brought to le by actors and broadcast on The Lynette Fay Show on BBC Radio Ulster at the end of June. Overall winners in each category will have their story turned into an animation and featured across the BBC, while the runners-up will receive a specially commissioned illustration of a scene from their story. All nine finalists will see their stories and their illustrations featured in a downloadable digital storybook.

Emma McCann, from Moneymore, raised over pound, for Cancer Focus NI after taking on the mammoth task and said she was ‘humbled’ by the donations. “People stepped up to the mark and the live feed on Facebook really made a dference. I could see when the donations were coming through,” she told the County Derry Post. “I just didn’t know what way it was going to go. The majority of people are furloughed from their work, they’re worried about their jobs. googletag.cmd.push “They don’t have an awful lot of money and there’s a huge amount of worthy events and challenges going on at the minute. “There were even a few others locally that day, and people only have a certain amount of money to give but they were fantastic.” As well as being thrilled with the amount of money raised for the charity, Emma says the support she received from friends, family and neighbours. A small crowd had gathered as she reached the last leg of her challenge, something she says took her by surprise. “I knew nothing about that! I just thought with what had been going on that I was on my own, just me, John and the dog,” said Emma. googletag.cmd.push “I couldn’t get over that my friends all decided to come and support me. I needed it. They all arrived during the last km or thereabouts. Emma had set herself a target of  hours for the km cycle, but, spurred on by the support, and a healthy competitive instinct, he managed to beat her target. “I had given myself five hours and was absolutely chuffed to have been able to do it in four hours, twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds,” she said. “I was tootling along at an average of about -km per hour but I’m actually quite competitive. “I looked at the stopwatch and thought, ‘I can do this in about : or so’ and I pushed it hard the last km and I got there.” Donations for the challenge can still be made by visiting Emma’s Just Giving page at Emma’s Lockdown Cycle km.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

Director of Programmes at North West Migrant’s Forum , Lilian Seenoi-Barr, claimed that racism is not a distant enemy, but one that exists in Derry which must be challenged immediately. She said that to realise that change, will mean overhauling society from top to bottom. On a community level, Mrs Seenoi-Barr believes people must have tough conversations around the dinner table and confront racism when they see or hear it. She said the video of George Floyd being killed by a US police officer provoked emotions in people from BAME communities in Derry about their own experiences of racism. googletag.cmd.push NWMF provides advice and support services to BAME communities living in the city. The group aims to promote ersity and good community relations and runs youth clubs. NWMF organised the Black Lives Matters rally in Derry on Saturday. Political leaders and police had appealed for the protest to be cancelled due to public safety concerns over the Coronavirus pandemic. Mrs Seenoi-Barr told the Derry News that there was ‘great demand’ from within BAME communities to express their feelings. Meetings were held to discuss how the event could go ahead safely with public health at the forefront of their minds. “We wanted people to feel comfortable about attending a public rally, we gave advice about social distancing, to come with your own PPE, butyou couldn’t access any we had plenty,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “It was a collective community response to what happened, and our community wanted to raise awareness of what is happening here, and make clear that this is not just an American issue. “It’s an issue that also affects us here in the North, here in this city, so let’s not be side-tracked by people who say this is an American issue or ‘all le matters’. “Absolutely, all le matters but the truth is that black lives are in danger, it’s like a house on fire. “It’s like ignoring the fire that is burning in someone’s house and yours is not burning but you say ‘all lives matter’.” Prior to Saturday’s event, the police called to Mrs Seenoi-Barr’s home where, she said, a caution was issued for ‘incitement and encouragement’ of an illegal rally. “How can the right to hold a peaceful protest and the freedom of expression, which is a fundamental human right, be an illegal gathering,” she said. “How was it that the event held prior to that on Friday wasn’t illegal  How is that when everyone went to beaches, where hundreds of people gathered, not illegal  “Evenit was not organised those people pre-meditated going to the beach.” The rally faced opposition from many people in the city who feel that during the current pandemic is not the right time to hold a march. In response, Mrs Seenoi-Barr,said: “There is no right time to fight a pandemic, you fight the pandemic when it exists. “I accept the coronavirus pandemic is the biggest health crisis this country has ever faced in this generation and it is posing a risk to each and every one of us. “But what I would like to say is that racism is a health pandemic that has been in existence for centuries, it is deeply enshrined in our society and it is right for us to respond to racism. “Because in our communities, there is no bigger threat than the other, coronavirus is killing our people, so is racism.” In , Mrs Seenoi-Barr told the Derry News that migrant children and their parents were being subjected to racist abuse in the city. She claimed that Saturday’s rally proves that it still exists. “The overwhelming text messages that I’m receiving from parents who say that the event made their children feel like they have support because over the years they have been attacked, racially abused in school and the schools are not helping. “They felt that was their moment and now they see that the community stands behind them. “People who were not able to come out of their houses. Parents have told me, ‘my children don’t leave the bedroom after school, they don’t go anywhere because they’re petried of being called names on the street or being racially bullied’. “But when they heard that we were going to be protesting, -year-olds were getting their parents to come out because they felt they had hope. “Those are people who have been traumatised, living with the pain of racism and injustices that exist within our society. “Let’s not kid ourselves that racism is only an American issue, it is here, and the event on Saturday demonstrated that.” She said the frustration and anger of migrants who have felt the ‘profound racial inequalities’ that exist in this country made them come out. “And honestly, I would be failing in my job as someone entrusted by those people to represent them, support them, and provide them a ,I did not respond to their cause. “At the moment the wrong thing to say is to say nothing, and the wrong thing to do is to do nothing. “Silence in this time is criminal,” Mrs Barr added. The number of people living in Derry from BAME communities is unknown because there is no ethnic monitoring in Northern Ireland, which Mrs Barr said is part of ‘systematic racism’. “Racism is not only about a man being killed on camera. “It is also the fact that we cannot access services, the fact that we are told we are very few in this community and maybe that is why we have no representation. “It is the unconscious biases that exist within the education system, the housing system and the civil service were there is only .% representation. “We have a majority of people who work in the NHS but how many of them are decision makers. They are entrusted with lives but are not entrusted with making decisions.” Hate crime legislation that exists is not fit for purpose, Mrs Barr believes, and should be brought in line with that in England and Wales. She said that the education system must be reformed so that the curriculum includes racism, equality, ersity and inclusion. “Knowledge is our weapon, and it is also our protection,” she added.

Director of Programmes at North West Migrant’s Forum , Lilian Seenoi-Barr, claimed that racism is not a distant enemy, but one that exists in Derry which must be challenged immediately. She said that to realise that change, will mean overhauling society from top to bottom. On a community level, Mrs Seenoi-Barr believes people must have tough conversations around the dinner table and confront racism when they see or hear it. She said the video of George Floyd being killed by a US police officer provoked emotions in people from BAME communities in Derry about their own experiences of racism. googletag.cmd.push NWMF provides advice and support services to BAME communities living in the city. The group aims to promote ersity and good community relations and runs youth clubs. NWMF organised the Black Lives Matters rally in Derry on Saturday. Political leaders and police had appealed for the protest to be cancelled due to public safety concerns over the Coronavirus pandemic. Mrs Seenoi-Barr told the Derry News that there was ‘great demand’ from within BAME communities to express their feelings. Meetings were held to discuss how the event could go ahead safely with public health at the forefront of their minds. “We wanted people to feel comfortable about attending a public rally, we gave advice about social distancing, to come with your own PPE, butyou couldn’t access any we had plenty,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “It was a collective community response to what happened, and our community wanted to raise awareness of what is happening here, and make clear that this is not just an American issue. “It’s an issue that also affects us here in the North, here in this city, so let’s not be side-tracked by people who say this is an American issue or ‘all le matters’. “Absolutely, all le matters but the truth is that black lives are in danger, it’s like a house on fire. “It’s like ignoring the fire that is burning in someone’s house and yours is not burning but you say ‘all lives matter’.” Prior to Saturday’s event, the police called to Mrs Seenoi-Barr’s home where, she said, a caution was issued for ‘incitement and encouragement’ of an illegal rally. “How can the right to hold a peaceful protest and the freedom of expression, which is a fundamental human right, be an illegal gathering,” she said. “How was it that the event held prior to that on Friday wasn’t illegal  How is that when everyone went to beaches, where hundreds of people gathered, not illegal  “Evenit was not organised those people pre-meditated going to the beach.” The rally faced opposition from many people in the city who feel that during the current pandemic is not the right time to hold a march. In response, Mrs Seenoi-Barr,said: “There is no right time to fight a pandemic, you fight the pandemic when it exists. “I accept the coronavirus pandemic is the biggest health crisis this country has ever faced in this generation and it is posing a risk to each and every one of us. “But what I would like to say is that racism is a health pandemic that has been in existence for centuries, it is deeply enshrined in our society and it is right for us to respond to racism. “Because in our communities, there is no bigger threat than the other, coronavirus is killing our people, so is racism.” In , Mrs Seenoi-Barr told the Derry News that migrant children and their parents were being subjected to racist abuse in the city. She claimed that Saturday’s rally proves that it still exists. “The overwhelming text messages that I’m receiving from parents who say that the event made their children feel like they have support because over the years they have been attacked, racially abused in school and the schools are not helping. “They felt that was their moment and now they see that the community stands behind them. “People who were not able to come out of their houses. Parents have told me, ‘my children don’t leave the bedroom after school, they don’t go anywhere because they’re petried of being called names on the street or being racially bullied’. “But when they heard that we were going to be protesting, -year-olds were getting their parents to come out because they felt they had hope. “Those are people who have been traumatised, living with the pain of racism and injustices that exist within our society. “Let’s not kid ourselves that racism is only an American issue, it is here, and the event on Saturday demonstrated that.” She said the frustration and anger of migrants who have felt the ‘profound racial inequalities’ that exist in this country made them come out. “And honestly, I would be failing in my job as someone entrusted by those people to represent them, support them, and provide them a ,I did not respond to their cause. “At the moment the wrong thing to say is to say nothing, and the wrong thing to do is to do nothing. “Silence in this time is criminal,” Mrs Barr added. The number of people living in Derry from BAME communities is unknown because there is no ethnic monitoring in Northern Ireland, which Mrs Barr said is part of ‘systematic racism’. “Racism is not only about a man being killed on camera. “It is also the fact that we cannot access services, the fact that we are told we are very few in this community and maybe that is why we have no representation. “It is the unconscious biases that exist within the education system, the housing system and the civil service were there is only .% representation. “We have a majority of people who work in the NHS but how many of them are decision makers. They are entrusted with lives but are not entrusted with making decisions.” Hate crime legislation that exists is not fit for purpose, Mrs Barr believes, and should be brought in line with that in England and Wales. She said that the education system must be reformed so that the curriculum includes racism, equality, ersity and inclusion. “Knowledge is our weapon, and it is also our protection,” she added.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

Crops lay flat in the fields from the constant pounding of the rain. As a family of farmers it was an extremely dficult time.ldquoIn between the deluges we managed to scramble our way to the first Irish Senior Cup final and emerged victorious mdash a rare moment of sunshine that year.For Paul, then a teenager still at school, the memories of  years ago are still vivid.ldquoIt was my first year in the st XI, playing alongside my father and Alfie. They were  and  years young at that time and still playing well.ldquoIn fact, the following year, in the same competition, I sat in amazement watching Alfie blast a ton against a Bangor with John Elder leading the attack, having opened the bowling for Ireland against Australia earlier that summer in front of , people at Downpatrick.ldquoAnyway, Alfie smashed nine huge sixes, all clearing the Strangford Road end. This was at a spritely age of .ldquoAll of a sudden I realised the legendary tales of Alfiersquos big hitting were true. Dad always said he hit the ball much further than anyone . That innings remains the most memorable I have seen from a Downpatrick player. saw the ICU as it was then bring in bowl-outs to decide washed-out contests, with all  players trying to hit the stumps in a shoot-out.In the first round Downpatrick faced Leinster and of the  players who aimed, only one was successful mdash the aforementioned Alfie.Downpatrick had reached the final after a famous win in the lionrsquos den of Donemana, with Brian Ferris and Jim Patterson smashing unbeaten fties in an emphatic victory.ldquoThere was a lot of publicity surrounding the Irish Senior Cup which at that time was sponsored by Schweppes, said Paul.ldquoIn the years that followed, just like the inter-pros played for the Guinness Cup, everyone simply called the competition lsquoThe Schweppesrsquo. In more recent times, the Ulster Cup was known as lsquoThe Clubturfrsquo.ldquoBefore the final, BBC TV sent a crew down to interview some of us, and ironically record us bowling at the stumps. It was still raining. It took us ages to hit the stumpshellipI got abuse at school.ldquoNeedless to say, the final was washed out without a bowl bowled and the miserable summer continued. It was desperately disappointing after a week of huge anticipation.The toss for the venue of the replay was conducted over the phone between the two captains, Ian Shields and Derek McCann.Downpatrick won and the replay was scheduled for midweek, Wednesday, September , and North Downrsquos Robin Haire recalls the conditions werenrsquot really fit for cricket.ldquoDownpatrick had actual puddles of water on parts of outfield, he recalled. ldquoMy abiding memory of that final was the spray of the water when you hit it along the ground.ldquoIt was totally unplayable, but the authorities wanted it played and out of the way. Nowadays umpires would have said try tomorrow.The decider itself proved to be a turgid, low-key affair, with little atmosphere and a contest which matched the gloomy conditions.ldquoIt just felt like a midweek league game, said Paul Linehan. ldquoPeople were at work, there was no crowd to speak of, it was cold and it wasnrsquot much of a game.ldquoNorth Down batted first, we bowled and fielded brilliantly, and they scraped to just . Karl Quinn and man of the match Philip Lennon each took three wickets, Jim Patterson got two, while Brian Hodges and Brian Ferris got one apiece.ldquoWe opened with Keith Malone and Derek McCann and I was due to come in three. I was a very nervous  year-old when I arrived at the wicket after they had put on .

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

Photo: PA WireArticle  of the Detention of TerroristsOrder  authorises a secretary of state, minister of state or under secretary of state to sign an ICO. As minister of state, I was one of the ministers authorised by that order to sign, and thus to make, ICOs. The Supreme Court’s judgment does not say which minister of state signed the ICO in relation to Gerry Adams. As I say, it may be that my signature was on some of the ICOs made in this period, although they could have been signed by David Windlesham or Paul Channon. Most likely, they would have been signed by David Windlesham as he was specically assigned by Mr Whitelaw to oversee security issues, although we all worked together as a team on all aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration. I note that it was David Windlesham who on  December  moved the motion in the House of Lords that the  Order be approved. He remarked then that “applications for interim custody orders are by no means automatically granted by the secretary of state.Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, a Justice of the Supreme Court of the UK and former Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland, who read out the unanimous judgement in the Gerry Adams case. Photo: Supreme Court PA WireThere is a thorough process of scrutiny before he, or anyone on his behalf, decides whether or not to sign one at all.”It is clear to me that the Supreme Court has misinterpreted the nature and scope of the  Order. The court misunderstands the signicance of Article , which specically provided for a minister of state or undersecretary of state to sign an ICO in the name of the secretary of state.This provision was understood by government in making the order and in exercising it, and by Parliament in the debates about whether to approve the order, to authorise the minister of state or under secretary of state to decide whether an ICO should be made. In so doing, weacted in the name of the secretary of state, who was responsible for the Northern Ireland Officeand the ministerial team and who was, of course, closely involved in many ICO decisions himself, as well as directing which ministers should oversee which aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration.The fundamental failure of the Supreme Court’s judgment is its total misunderstanding of the nature of ministerial and departmental government and methods of operating. A junior minister on duty at Stormont is in effect the persona of Her Majesty’s government and is thereby empowered to act for and as the secretary of state in the latter’s absence. And the secretary of state was often unavoidably absent. In relation to Northern Ireland, it was inherent in the nature of direct rule that the secretary of state had to be frequently in London – in Parliament or the cabinet – and that his responsibilities would often have to be exercised by a junior minister on the ground.On the weekends, one of us was always the duty minister. One minister always had to be available to Parliament, including to answer urgent questions. And those of us who were members of the House of Commons had also toto London frequently to vote .When the order was made, on  November , and when it was approved by Parliament in December , it was certainly contemplated that there would often be cases in which an ICO would need to be made by the minister of state or under secretary of state rather than by the secretary of state himself. The order clearly provides for this to happen. The high number of ICOs that the government anticipated would have to be made, and were in practice made, also helps explain why the order provides that junior ministers may order temporary detention. The Supreme Court’s assertion that it would not have been dficult for the secretary of state to consider each case personally and to make each ICO himself simply does not match the reality.As it happens, almost all signing of ICOs, where the actual signing of the document took place in Stormont Castle, was discussed directly with other ministers and usually with the secretary of state by telephone or message,he had to be in London or his constituency home in Penrith.The secretary of state could not always be directly involved and even when involved in some cases it would often be the minister of state or under secretary of state, in Stormont, who had reviewed the grounds for making an ICO in detail and who was satisfied that an ICO should be made.The minister on duty in Stormont was fully entitled to act in the secretary of state’s name. Other ministers were consulted, to the extent possible, not because this was what the law required, asthe junior minister were simply the mouthpiece of the secretary of state , but because that is how any team of ministers, operating as a team, would act in relation to important matters with political implications for which the secretary of state would have to accept constitutional responsibility.In any case, in relation to Gerry Adams one can be absolutely sure that it would have been discussed most fully and confirmed by the secretary of state before the ICO was made.The political salience and security implications of detaining Mr Adams would have made this unavoidable.I do not know whether there is a record of the secretary of state’s involvement in this case or any other case in which his signature does not appear on the ICO itself. The Supreme Court’s judgment implies not.This may be unsurprising in view of how ICOs were often made, which is to say by a minister of state or under secretary of state in Stormont, with the secretary of state often consulted by message or telephone from London or Penrith, but without a record of that involvement necessarily being kept or now being available. There would have been no reason, and perhaps no capacity, to record the secretary of state’s personal involvement, save in those cases where he himself signed the ICO, because Article  authorised the minister of state to sign the ICO and this signature had itself to be sufficient to authorise detention on the ground in Northern Ireland.But it is a travesty to conclude that because ministers complied with the terms of the  Order, and did not go above and beyond it to somehow record the secretary of state’s involvement, the ICO must now be quashed and the detention ruled unlawful.It is quite startling to see the Supreme Court reasoning that the prosecution had failed in Gerry Adams’s case to prove that the secretary of state had personally authorised his detention. The shape of the  Order makes very clear that an ICO signed by a minister of state or snder secretary of state is the same as an ICO signed by the secretary of state himself and authorises detention. It would have been utterly unworkable for the Royal Ulster Constabulary to have refused to detain suspected terrorists unless and until proof had been provided that an ICO signed by the minister had also been personally considered by the secretary of state. Or for commissioners determining whether there should be continuing detention to have held that they did not have jurisdiction unless and until the secretary of state had provided evidence that he had personally considered whether to make the ICO in question.This would have made the scheme of the  Order simply unworkable. The Supreme Court’s reading of the  Order was not what government intended, or understood, or what Parliament approved. The whole point of the signature requirement in Article  is to make clear who is authorised to make an ICO and thus whose signature on the face of an ICO makes it lawful to detain the person in question.The making of ICOs in -, which the Supreme Court has now denounced as unlawful, was entirely in line with the law, with the wishes of Parliament, with normal ministerial practice and with the immediate security needs of protecting the public from acts of appalling violence and bloodshed . Like Professor Ekins and Sir Stephen, I take the case for legislation to overturn the effect of the Supreme Court’s judgment – to make clear that ICOs signed by a minister of state or under secretary of state were lawful — to be overwhelming. In so legislating, Parliament would be reaffirming its clear, obvious and original intentions and the absolutely normal practices of departmental governance and ministerial responsibility.• Lord Howell of Guildford is the last surviving member of the ministerial team in the Northern Ireland Office, with responsibility under the Detention of TerroristsOrder .

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baeacfeabbcfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aebbbeaeeeedab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
