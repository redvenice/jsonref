The brain registers the majority of information about flavour via millions of olfactory (smell) cells, so that is why the cider must be swirled in the glass to release aromas. A wine glass is best for doing this, but don’t fill it to the brim as the cider needs space to breathe so the aromas develop. Gently swirl the cider a couple of times and sniff it. Then take a sip and let the cider cover the tongue. More aromas will be released and travel to the nasal cavity through the back of the throat. Think about what you smell and taste, the cider’s body, the texture, the overall drinking experience. Then repeat. That’s how to taste cider! All-occasion quaffing: Thatchers Gold Thatchers’ flagship cider, Gold, is a blend of several apple varieties. Eating apples bestow Thatchers Gold fruitiness and a satisfying “bite”, while cider apples including two of the undisputed superstars – dabinett and Harry Masters Jersey – give body and depth to the flavour. Thatchers Gold is an eminently quaffable cider for all occasions with ripe and juicy green apple aromas and flavours bursting from the glass, a sherbet-like mouthfeel with gentle carbonation, and a refreshing tang. If you are a wine drinker looking for a cider to suit your palate then Thatchers Gold will appeal to fans of viognier. Pair with grilled sea bass, or satay vegetables if you’re veggie. Cheshire cheese is a great match too its slight saltiness will contract the cider’s underlying sweetness. Crisp and cloudy: Thatchers HazeThatchers Haze brims with fruitiness from a blend of fruit bowl favourites: discovery, falstaff, gala and jonagold. Cider made from eating apples tends to be light-bodied and crisp, and Thatchers Haze is no exception. A solid entry-level blend for those wishing to explore cider more deeply on the nose and palate it has green apples, pears, banana, a hint of lemon, an effervescent mouthfeel, and a sweet tangy finish. The cider’s distinct natural cloudiness is thanks to jonagold apple juice adding a sweetness that makes Thatchers Haze match especially well with spicy foods, such as falafel burgers, or spicy pork stir-fry. For wine drinkers, if you imagine riesling with that easy-drinking fruitiness and refreshing acidity, then Thatchers Haze will appeal to the same palate. The solo star: Thatchers KatyWhile most ciders are made from blending different apple varieties, Thatchers Katy is a single-variety cider. Made from the popular eating apple of the same name, it is fresh and fruity with a subtle sweetness, a refreshing acidity, tingling carbonation and crisp, tangy finish. Thatchers ferments Katy apples with a type of yeast that sparkling wine producers use, enhancing the flavour. However, there’s evidence to suggest it was 17th-century West Country cider makers who first experimented with secondary fermentation to add a natural sparkle to the drink, some time before champagne was invented – so you could say that cider was the original sparkling tipple. Take the flute challenge – pour a glass of Thatchers Katy and a glass of prosecco and blind taste them – which is the wine and which is the premium cider? Thatchers Katy is perfect as an aperitif and for dining. Food-wise, go for lighter textured food with delicate flavours, such as grilled cod and asparagus risotto. For a cheese match, the savoury salty flavours of parmesan are a contrast to the fruity sweetness of Thatchers Katy. Sweet explosion: Thatchers RoséWaves of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavours refresh the mouth. Thatchers Rosé cider is made exclusively from those dessert apple favourites cripps pink, gala and fuji. Sweet fruitiness pops and fizzes across your tongue, before the mouth is filled with a zingy texture. It’s a light and easy-drinking cider that suits being well chilled. Drink it for refreshment at a picnic, or treat it as a dessert cider to be enjoyed with Eton mess or summer pudding. Full-bodied and spiced: Thatchers Rascal Imagine if apple pie came in a glass. Rascal is the cider equivalent, with a scrumptious array of flavours including red apples, pears, demerara sugar and spice. Created with a blend of cider apple stalwarts – redstreak, dabinett and tremlett’s bitter – this bold cider contains tannins that give the cider a fuller mouthfeel than the ciders made with eating or dessert apples. Tannins attract fats and proteins, cut through the texture of dense and fatty food and refresh the mouth. So pair with hearty meals such as a Sunday roast or mac and cheese, followed by apple crumble and custard. Equally, this is an excellent sitting-in-your-favourite-pub-and-chatting with your friends type of cider.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Hugh Kinsella  CunninghamEPAMount Nyiragongo in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, erupted on Saturday, sending panicked residents of the nearby city of Goma fleeing, although a volcanologist said the city did not appear to be in danger.People grabbed mattresses and other belongings and fled towards the frontier with neighbouring Rwanda as a red glow filled the sky above the city. Power was out across much of the city and phone lines were busy, Reuters reporters said.Dario Tedesco, a volcanologist based in the lakeside city of about 2 million, said\u0026nbspthat Goma did not appear to be at risk, and lava appeared to be flowing east in the direction of the Rwandan border. Tedesco earlier had said he thought lava might hit Goma.A United Nations source said a reconnaissance flight by a UN helicopter appeared to show lava was not flowing towards Goma or any major population centres.Nyiragongo last erupted in 2002, killing 250 people and making 120,000 people homeless after lava flowed into Goma.“I ask the population to remain calm and follow the instructions of the provincial coordinator of civil protection and the instructions of the police and armed forces,” North Kivu province’s military governor, Constant Ndima, told reporters.Emergency meetingCongo’s government spokesman, Patrick Muyaya, tweeted photos of an emergency meeting in Kinshasa, the capital, led by the prime minister and said authorities were closely monitoring the situation.INSO, which co-ordinates safety for non-governmental organisations, said in a note that the lava had cut off a main road that runs north from Goma.Volcano watchers have been worried that the volcanic activity observed in the last five years at Nyiragongo mirrors that in the years preceding eruptions in 1977 and 2002.Volcanologists at the Goma Volcano Observatory, which monitors Nyiragongo, have struggled to make basic checks on a regular basis since the World Bank cut funding amid embezzlement allegations.In a bulletin on May 10th, the observatory said there had been increased seismic activity at Nyiragongo earlier in the month. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram photo appears to show princess latifa in dubai shopping centre","story":"Unverified image is believed to show Princess Latifa at a Dubai mall cafe with Sioned Taylor, formerly of the Royal Navy. Photograph: @shinnybryninstagramSheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai, whose plight has captivated the world since a daring attempt at escaping her father across the Indian Ocean, appears to have been photographed in public for the first time in years.In a picture posted to Instagram two days ago by both former Royal Navy member Sioned Taylor and another user, Princess Latifa is seated with two women at a cafe table in what Taylor identified as Dubai’s Mall of the Emirates.While Instagram posts do not include metadata, which would show the date and time the photograph was taken, a cinema in the background carries adverts for the film Demon Slayer: Mugen Train, which was released in the UAE on May 13th.Friends of the princess told the BBC that the photograph was legitimate.The now 35-year-old Latifa fled Dubai in early 2018, accusing her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, of years of abuse. She and a friend left for Oman by car, then used jet-skis to join the yacht Nostromo and sailed across the Indian Ocean to Goa.She was forcibly returned to the United Arab Emirates eight days after her escape when at least eight Indian and 10 UAE special forces members intercepted the Nostromo vessel off the coast of India using unmarked speedboats and a helicopter.The princess is believed to have been held against her will since then on the orders of the sheikh, who is the powerful ruler of Dubai and prime minister of the UAE.Sheikh Mohammed has said that the raid on the Nostromo was a rescue mission, and has consistently rejected allegations of abuse against at least two of his 25 children.SpeculationThe picture’s publication immediately led to speculation over how, why and when it was released. Last month, the UN said the UAE had failed to provide compelling proof that Latifa is still alive.The princess has not been heard from since mid-February, when she recorded videos shared with media in which she said she was being held as a hostage and feared for her life. She has not been seen in public since late 2018.“This indicates that the UAE intends to perhaps allow Latifa to return to public life as mentioned in their last statement,” said Radha Stirling, the founder of rights group Detained in Dubai.“The UAE has declined direct media requests and largely ignored United Nations’ pleadings. The Maktoums see many of the people calling for Latifa’s release as self-interested and in some cases, actual convicted criminals. They’re not going to send Latifa into the hands of those who may use and manipulate her, and they don’t want to see her as an adverse witness in the British courtroom drama surrounding Princess Haya.”Princess Haya, Sheikh Mohammed’s second wife, left Dubai for London with their two young children in 2019, seeking a orce. The UK high court ruled in 2020 that the sheikh had tried to abduct the children.In its ruling on Princess Haya’s case the court also found that another of the sheikh’s daughters, Princess Shamsa, was kidnapped by his staff from the streets of Cambridge in 2000. Shamsa, who would now be 39, has not been heard from since. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178More than 20 runners killed as sudden \u0026#39disastrous weather\u0026#39 hits cross-country mountain race in ChinaCoronavirus latest news: CDC investigates reports of heart inflammation in vaccinated teensTrucks of fresh water used to feed Taiwan\u0026#39s semiconductors as crops left to die in punishing droughtMyanmar\u0026#39s forgotten coup morphing into civil warIsraeli and Palestinian leaders tell Nick Clegg to stop plague of misinformationComment: Anti-Zionism is just the new, innocent-sounding incarnation of an ancient Jew hatred Comment: Don\u0026#39t panic: Rhodes won\u0026#39t fall.

Next month, Congress is to be given an unclassified report on evidence collected by the Pentagon’s UAP Task Force, the Office of Naval Intelligence and the FBI.Ufologists - people who investigate UFOs - across the globe are hailing it as an unprecedented watershed moment in their long quest to uncover what the US government really knows – and they have former president Donald Trump to thank for it.“We’re absolutely in new territory here,” says Nick Pope, who investigated UFO sightings while working as a British civil servant for the Ministry of Defence in the 1990s.“What’s really elevated this is the sheer number, and position, of people now speaking out, saying we’re dealing with something that must be taken seriously, he added.“When top guns, who don’t impress easily, get excited about the capability of these objects, their speed, manoeuvrability, trans-medium travel in water and air… that gets my attention.The pilot testimony is important, but there is so much more: radar data, infrared, measurement and signature intelligence… and we’ll get to see some of it.”John Ratcliffe, director of National Intelligence under President Trump, raised anticipation when he hinted recently that there was “a lot” more information than the public currently knows.He said he had seen satellite imagery of objects “frankly engaging in actions that are difficult to explain”, and incidents of them breaking the sound barrier with no sonic boom.The following month, a farmer found wreckage on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. In a press release, the US military called it a “flying disc”, but later said it was part of a weather balloon.By the 1950s, the US Air Force was being inundated with UFO reports from the public. One of the most notorious was the so-called “Invasion of Washington” in 1952, when numerous sightings were made over the capital in a two-week period.It was the Cold War, and the CIA, fearing mass hysteria could play into the hands of the Soviet Union, worked to debunk sightings and infiltrate UFO-hunting groups.“Further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified,” it said.For decades afterwards, anyone who reported seeing something strange in the sky was considered a crackpot – even leading lights in the US military.However, there remained a few highly influential figures who believed a mystery was there to be solved. The most powerful among them was Senator Harry Reid, the Democrat leader in the US Senate from 2005 to 2017.In 2007, Mr Reid managed to push through Congress, clandestinely, $22 million in “black ops” funding for a new department. It was innocuously named the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP).From a fifth-floor office deep inside the Pentagon, a real-life X-Files team studied hundreds of reported UFO sightings – including the USS Nimitz “Tic Tac” incident from 2004.The department was led by Luis Elizondo, a career intelligence official who later resigned because he felt his findings were not being taken seriously enough.Shortly after his departure in late 2017, Mr Elizondo told the  how his team established geographical “hot spots” for sightings, sometimes near nuclear facilities, and common ways in which UFOs moved.“We began to see trends and similarities in incidents – very distinct observables. Extreme manoeuvrability, hypersonic velocity without a sonic boom, speeds of 8,000mph. A lot of this was supported by radar signal data, gun camera footage from aircraft, multiple witnesses.”He said he came to a “realisation that these are probably not any type of aircraft in any national inventory. I think it’s pretty clear it’s not us. So one has to ask the question where they’re from.”He also added: “There was never any display of hostility.”A key moment in the UFO debate – and whether it should be taken seriously – came in 2017 when the New York Times published the infrared video of the “Tic Tac” sighting. Ufologists felt vindicated, not least because it proved the Pentagon had seen fit to investigate the incident.Today, thanks to lockdown – which provided a dramatic reduction in light pollution coupled with an army of people with empty evenings on their hands – supposed UFO sightings have proliferated around the globe.In the UK alone, reports of suspected alien spacecraft doubled last year.And once-secret intelligence just keeps coming. Last month, footage of bizarre images of flashing pyramid-shaped UFOs was posted online, which the Pentagon confirmed was taken in 2019, by a US Navy ship off California.Another leaked video, taken from a fighter jet in 2015, showed a small object moving at tremendously high speed just above the water off Virginia on the US east coast. Pilots could be heard yelling: “Oh my gosh, dude” and “Wow! What is that, man? Look at that flying!”In another incident, pilots reported seeing an object that looked like a cube inside a sphere flying between their aircraft, which were barely 100ft apart.Many of these incidents are expected to be further detailed in next month’s report. But even though it will be “unclassified”, it\u0027s still unclear exactly how much will come out.“I don’t expect it’ll plunge into extraterrestrial visitation. If there is anything really juicy, it will probably be in the classified annex.

It was then replaced by Plan B.”Britain’s response to the pandemic has been widely criticised. The virus has so far claimed more than 127,000 lives in the UK.The former No 10 advisor said that once it became clear a lockdown was needed Downing Street should have acted far more quickly and decisively.Critics of Mr Cummings will point out that he was at the heart of Government when decisions were being made on whether and when to introduce the sort of lockdown which was eventually first implemented on 16 March 2020, when Mr Hancock, the Health Secretary, announced that all unnecessary social contact should cease.Mr Cummings is also deeply critical of Whitehall officials and departmental civil servants who he claims held back the innovative work of young scientists in trying to develop Britain’s Covid testing capability.Referring to interactions between the Prime Minister (PM) and Cabinet Secretary (Cabsec) and Department of Health and Public Health England officials, he says: “Mass testing same story as elsewhere: some brilliantdedicated relatively junior officials and great young scientists and entrepreneurs held back by senior managementDHSCPHE (particularly awful) \u0026amp Whitehall legacy procurement \u0026amp HR horror shows.Mr Cummings claims that delays in mass testing were unnecessary and went on to cost thousands more lives.He tweeted: “UK gvt did v badly, turned out we cdshd have had these tests at millions pday scale by Sep latest, instead of seriously starting in Sep, which wd have greatly changed Q4, 2020. Those screaming from FebMarch were ignored, monthslives£ needlessly lost.”He added: “If mass testing had been developed properly earlier in year as cdshd have been, wd probably have avoided lockdowns 2\u0026amp3 while awaiting vaccine.”Last week Mr Cummings warned that the Government needed to allow “public scrutiny” of its vaccine strategy , saying that “secrecy contributed greatly to the catastrophe” of the early months of the pandemic.His volley of accusations comes weeks after Downing Street briefed that Mr Cummings was suspected of leaking a series of damaging stories to newspapers about the Prime Minister. In response, Mr Cummings published a blog raising further damaging allegations.The Department of Health declined to comment.

One MP said: “While we have all been banned from leaving the country, ‘air miles Alok’ has been jetting around the world to hand out lectures on why people shouldn’t fly.“This isn’t so much about preparing for COP 26, it is a bit more like a gap year. Why didn’t he go online? They held the G7 online.”The UK is due to host the 26th UN Climate Summit in Glasgow in November. One Whitehall source defended Mr Sharma, saying he had taken the train to Glasgow.The source said that Mr Sharma had to hold face-to-face meetings as part of the negotiations ahead of the COP meeting, adding that he had held more than 80 virtual meetings with over 60 countries.In one case, after Mr Sharma visited Korea, the Government made “tangible announcements” on coal and other areas at a summit shortly afterwards.The source said: “There are some meetings which just have to be done in person if you want to make a success of it.”Friends also pointed to the fact that the Government’s Integrated Review found that climate change and preserving bioersity was the UK’s number one international priority in the decade to come.The source added that Mr Sharma was only allowed to travel with a “very limited” number of people on overseas trips, but declined to say how many had accompanied him.A government spokesman said: “Helping the world tackle the climate emergency is an international priority for the Government.“Virtual meetings play an important role, however face-to-face meetings are key to success in the negotiations the UK is leading as hosts of COP26 and are crucial to understanding and seeing first-hand the opportunities and challenges other countries are facing in the fight against climate change.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"europhiles now position opposing trade deals everyone except","story":"Something became painfully clear this week. The opposition to Britain’s global trade deals is not driven by concern for hill farmers, or fears for the Union, or any economic calculations whatever. It is driven, rather, by Europhile nostalgia by the desire, perhaps unconscious, for Brexit to fail so that its opponents might be proved right after all.Most Remainers accepted the referendum result with good grace. But a handful cannot let go and, like Jacobites, cling to what they know to be a lost cause because it has become part of their identity. The paradox is that, in doing so, they have lost touch with the principles that made them support the EU in the first place.The case for free trade is essentially internationalist. It takes as its starting point the assumption that, if you want to sell me something and I want to buy it, the authorities need a good reason to come between us and hamper our transaction. The fact that you live in another country does not, in itself, qualify as a good reason.You might think that Euro-integrationists, who like to flaunt their contempt for nationalism, would buy that logic. And plenty of them do. But for some, the issue is now tribal rather than political. Because global trade has Brexity connotations, they have manoeuvred themselves into the extraordinary position of wanting unhindered commerce with the EU but not with anyone else.When Liam Fox was trade secretary, he commissioned some opinion polls which showed that Brexit had caused a geomagnetic reversal, a polar switch. People who saw themselves as liberal cosmopolitans were suddenly against international trade deals, associating them with Brexit and with the politicians they disliked. Conversely, a certain kind of UKIP voter who used to bang on about the need to protect our strategic industries and grow our own food had become readier to embrace global markets.Even so, it is extraordinary that anyone should object to restoring our pre-EEC relationship with Australia, a country to which we could hardly be closer in commercial practices, legal norms, accountancy systems, political institutions, regulatory standards, professional qualifications, wage levels or sentimental links.The electorate at large is enthusiastic about a deal. So, indeed, are the supposedly authoritarian Red Wall voters who are forever being invoked by Tories who want a more statist party. This week, my think tank, the Initiative for Free Trade, polled Conservative supporters in Red Wall constituencies, and found that no fewer than 87 per cent of them backed the free trade agreement with Oz.In opposing that deal, NFU leaders simultaneously set themselves against public opinion, the Conservative government and (it seems) most farmers – not a comfortable place to be.How did they get into this mess? It’s hardly as though Australian produce – counter-seasonal to our own, remember – is a threat. As I wrote here last week, 91 per cent of the beef we import comes from the EU and only one per cent from Australia. Yet NFU leaders maintain with straight faces that tariff-free imports are fine from the EU but not from anywhere else.“I had a briefing call with some NFU lobbyists” an MP who had initially been predisposed to back them told me. “It was just embarrassing. They kept changing their story. They started by claiming that Australian beef was treated with growth hormones, and when an MP pointed out that hormone-treated beef was excluded from the deal, they just shifted ground and moved onto something else.”The NFU’s Euro-mania sets it apart from the bulk British farmers, most of whom voted Leave. The CBI used to have a similar problem, having alienated many business people, not so much by its opposition to Brexit as by its tribalism on the issue. To its credit, the CBI is trying to repair the damage. Its new leader, Tony Danker, wants to focus on economic growth, and has appealed to Eurosceptics to rejoin.The NFU has yet to make the equivalent adjustment – which is a pity, because it has an important job to do. It is absolutely right to champion our upland farms. No one wants to see our loveliest countryside degraded. A wiser NFU leadership would be working on ensuring that our systems of direct grants and subsidies go where they are needed. That will genuinely ensure a viable rural economy, in a way that trade protectionism simply won’t.In parallel, a wiser NFU leadership would be making sure that Britain’s farmers, who are generally more innovative and entrepreneurial than their EU rivals, get their share of the world’s fastest-growing markets, namely those in Asia. It would, in other words, be arguing for more trade, not less.The NFU’s missteps over the Australia deal are, however, trivial next to the SNP’s. “Yet again, Scotland’s interests have been thrown under the Brexit bus,” said Ian Blackford – which is what he says about pretty much everything these days. But it is almost the precise opposite of the truth. Official analysis shows that, while every part of the UK will benefit from the deal, Scotland (along with London) will gain the most. Australian tariffs on whisky will be removed, and Edinburgh’s financial services will gain access to new markets.The trade deal, though, is just the start. As the UK deepens its economic relations with the Commonwealth, the Pacific and, in time, the United States, a new regulatory and commercial model will take shape, more open and liberal than those favoured by Beijing or Brussels. Scots will soon be taking advantage of increased opportunities to live and work in other Anglosphere countries. Leaving the UK will come to mean leaving those arrangements.Boris Johnson put it beautifully on Friday – speaking, appropriately, from the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth II in Portsmouth: “It is vital, as a great historic free-trading nation that grew to prosperity thanks to free trade, and thanks indeed to the Royal Navy, that we see these new openings not as threats but as opportunities.”Quite. Scots, perhaps even more than other Brits, know that fortune lies across the open main. We have always been an ocean-going people. We are not going to change now.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"glastonburys live worthy farm descends farce thousands locked","story":"An all star live-streamed virtual Glastonbury festival rapidly turned into an online disaster on Saturday night when audiences were thousands of people were unable to watch the pay-per-view event.Coldplay, Haim, Damon Albarn, Wolf Alice and Michael Kiwanuka and members of Radiohead were all billed to play, but a technical problem meant most viewers could not log on to the website.Ticketholders received “invalid code” errors, or were greeted with the message “access denied”.Huge numbers of people took to social media to complain before Glastonbury Festival apologised via its official Twitter account, and said they were speaking to virtual events company Driift to “find out what the issue is.”All the Driift Twitter account could suggest was that ticketholders “keep trying”, which provoked anger on Twitter.  Invalid code were my favourite band way before they were cool, tweeted DJ SK Shlomo.Nearly two hours into the event, it was finally turned into a free livestream available for anyone to watch.Organisers later tweeted to say they were offering those affected on the BST timezone extended access to the stream on Sunday. They also said they would be offering a refund for those who required one, with tickets costing £20.I was one of the people locked out by this technological breakdown. To be fair, hitting repeat to try and access the Glastonbury website has long been part of the festival experience, although this usually happens when you are trying to buy tickets, not when you are in place and ready to rock.The frustration was akin to being stuck outside the gates in a muddy queue knowing your favourite band is already on stage. Only without the mud, obviously, and with much nicer toilets.“It feels very Glastonbury to be waiting,” tweeted journalist Caitlin Moran. “And, like, we can just eat snacks and sit on the sofa.”The problem was widespread. I had three access codes, none of which worked. Viewers who paid £20 and upwards for tickets were understandably furious, especially when given that the solution was to make the concert freely available to everyone on YouTube.It is a potential disaster for Glastonbury, who had hoped to raise money to help keep the festival afloat. It could be even more disastrous for Driift, who specialise in staging live onstream events.As a rock critic who attends many online events, I have experienced such problems before, but never on this scale. But then Glastonbury never likes to do anything by halves. It is worth noting that most live streams aren’t actually live, and Glastonbury was no exception. Performances have been filmed over the past week around Worthy Farm in Somerset, following social distancing rules, with no audience. This concert should have been a showcase event demonstrating the new power and potential of an online festival. All that I can say to that is live music can\u0027t come back quickly enough.Read more: Did Bowie beat Adele?

The Academy has said while it will review objects with decolonising in mind, with work to begin in the next 12 to 18 months, the primary motivation for disposing of any items would be to create more space for teaching at its building in Marylebone, central London.Before the review takes place, the Academy will be focussed on welcoming students back with a more erse curriculum that has been developed to make their studies more inclusive.Part of the focus of revised curriculums will include “highlighting issues of Empire and the Western classical tradition in their studies”.The Academy has been running events on “decolonisation of the repertoire”, and a newly devised elective programme of study will focus on “erse voices in classical music, seen through the prism of artist-activists”.It is understood that composers with connection to slavery or colonialism, such as Handel, have been removed from the syllabus and that all historical figures studied by students will “continue to be taught with sensitivity to context”.The Academy stated: “The Academy is an educational institution and our Museum and Library collections are not stand-alone features, but form part of our educational mission.“At this time we are prioritising work on making our curriculum more inclusive, and highlighting gaps in our holdings, rather than auditing the thousands of objects and books in existing collections.”A spokesman added: “The reason we are undertaking the review of the collection is to maximise space for teaching and learning at our central London premises.“As part of this we will be reviewing the collection through a decolonisation lens, but our primary aim is to free up space.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"repeated blunders prove bbcs bamboozled board must reformed","story":"In response to the excoriating Dyson report and Prince William’s unprecedented criticism, the BBC’s reaction has been perfectly correct: “Apologies, lessons learned, it was a long time ago … blah blah”. But given the long-standing and unrelenting concerns over BBC journalism, such platitudes are no longer enough to hide a systemic failure of accountability, governance and culture.There are two BBCs. First, there is the journalism of the Ten O’Clock News, the Today show, news for the nations and regions, and Panorama. Then there is the BBC programming side that delights us with Strictly Come Dancing, Fleabag, Line of Duty and Sir David Attenborough.It is the BBC’s journalism that too often lets the corporation down. The Iraq war broadcast about the dodgy dossier that ended with the death of Dr David Kelly the failure to transmit its own exposure of Jimmy Savile the unforgivable and mistaken traducing of Lord McAlpine the coverage of the arrest of (the innocent) Sir Cliff Richard – the list goes on and on.To this charge sheet must be added widespread accusations of bias about election coverage from all parties, Brexit bias, unbalanced coverage of the Middle East, Scottish politics and a host of other topics. These issues just hang in the air, unexamined, and so the BBC journalistic caravan moves on.I would urge the Government and the board of the BBC and Ofcom, in next year’s midterm BBC review, to consider devolving governance of BBC journalism from the main board to a new independent board (not government-appointed), comprising only members qualified by their experience in senior editorial positions of responsibility.This new editorial board should be chaired by a specialist, qualified editorial figure chosen from the main board. (There are two such highly qualified ex-journalists on the current board). The task of this new editorial board would be to oversee and govern all the journalism of the BBC, with the director general (the BBC’s editor-in-chief) and his or her key editorial managers regularly and directly accountable to this board. It should include whistleblowing within its remit.Historically, the problem for the main, lay board of the BBC has always been that it has too big an agenda to allow effective scrutiny. This gives the executive huge power to steer the board to the outcomes of its choosing – the Yes, Minister playbook writ large.But unless you have been a journalist, how can you know what questions and “supplementaries” to ask? You wouldn’t expect non clinicians to cross examine, say, a surgeon suspected of malpractice.The BBC has always suffered from a board that is too easily bamboozled by the executive. Journalism can be a minefield, and often is for the BBC. The succession of high-profile failures is just the tip of a very big iceberg. How many horrors have not hit the headlines, one wonders?There is a long-standing, deep rooted and destructive culture within BBC journalism that must be reversed. It starts with their default position, whenever challenged, that they are not and cannot ever be wrong. One example: it took Primark three years to get the BBC to admit that footage the corporation broadcast alleging child slavery in the production of clothing for their stores was faked. It was obvious from day one that the reporter’s email confirming he had secured the slave footage of children working for Primark predated the actual footage shot by several days. Clearly faked – any journalist could have spotted that. I could cite other cases from personal experience.You can add arrogance to the bad culture charge sheet. Politicians, industry leaders and public servants are expected to turn up when they get the BBC’s summons to be called to account on their airwaves. If they are refused, they make no bones about their sense that the refusal is an affront. During the last general election, Andrew Neil complained to camera about Boris Johnson’s refusal to appear on his show. The fact that his editor allowed this indulgence on air is reflective of the BBC’s arrogance. Neil was just expressing a BBC attitude – you come when we call.We hear BBC journalists, rightly, harrying interviewees about their lack of accountability and transparency. But that has a hollow ring to it post the Dyson report, which highlights a breath-taking hypocrisy in the corporate BBC, which is anything but transparent and accountable itself. Remember, it took 26 years for the truth about the Bashir deception to be established. (Big tick, by the way, for Tim Davie, the new director genera,l who commissioned Lord Dyson.)The BBC believes that owning up to mistakes, and quickly, is a sign of weakness. But it is a sign of strength and they need to be made to understand that. The candour, honesty and transparency they expect from those they interrogate must also apply to the BBC itself. This is a deep-rooted culture that will be hard to shift. A new editorial board is the best way to start that process.The governance change that I propose, based on a lifetime in broadcasting, would, for the first time, create a systematic and direct line of accountability by BBC journalism to a specialist, independent board, chaired by a suitably qualified main board member. It will provide a sense of accountability on a day-to-day basis as journalists go about their work.The editorial board’s remit, always post-transmission, never pre-, would require it to be proactive in reviewing coverage after big events. How did the BBC cover Brexit? Was the general election coverage in touch and balanced? Has the BBC’s Covid coverage met public needs? Is BBC Scotland’s treatment of the SNP meeting its impartiality requirements? Has coverage of the Middle East conflict met the highest BBC standards of accuracy and impartiality? And so on. It would also be well qualified to “sniff out” anything questionable that the board felt worthy of drilling into.By publishing its reviews and judgments, and by referring wrongdoing to the main board for action, the editorial board would, for the first time in the corporation’s history, make BBC journalism truly and publicly accountable to a peer group, independent of management and, of course, of government.I hope that the BBC board and the Government will look at this proposed reform in the lead-up to next year’s midterm review of the BBC.

Earlier research also shows AstraZeneca takes longer to reach optimum effectiveness.Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, lead author of the PHE research team, said the “key message” was that two doses were “highly effective” against the Indian variant and would offer “higher protection” against severe illness and hospitalisation.Professor Susan Hopkins, PHE’s Covid-19 strategic response director, said the “trend” was “quite clear” and was heading in the “right direction”.Responding to the data, Sir Iain told The : “It is time for us to stop fearing all day and every day. We have to get on with our lives.“It is time the scientists were put back in their laboratories again and told ‘leave the Government to us’.“It is time for the British people to get back to work and to feel safe. And they won’t feel safe if every day some scientist comes up on the television to say, ‘Oh My God, we don’t know enough about this, we should stay locked down’.”Mark Harper MP, chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group of more than 60 Tory MPs, added: “This new data, which confirms our vaccines are very effective against the B.1.617.2 variant first identified in India, means that the Government’s roadmap should proceed as planned and all domestic restrictions should end in June.“I hope the Prime Minister will now be able to say more about this by the end of this month as he had originally planned. Early confirmation that 21 June will see the end of social distancing would be especially welcome for the hospitality industry, which can’t survive unaided if social distancing were to continue.“Effective vaccines break the link between cases and serious disease, hospitalisation and death. They enable us to get back to living like normal again.”Government sources said on Saturday night that any decision on June 21 was dependent on hospitalisation data due this week, to see if new infections were causing serious illness. However, the researchers were reassured because so far there had been no signs of “increased severity in hospitalisations”.Shortly before the research was released, Mr Cummings launched a fresh series of tweets claiming the Government’s initial plan had been to try to secure herd immunity, before it was replaced by lockdowns as the death toll soared.He also claimed the failure to introduce mass testing by September last year had cost thousands more lives, and was responsible for a second lockdown.The PHE report also highlighted how the new Indian strain was more prevalent among people “with a history of foreign travel”.It notes how the Indian variant was “rapidly circulating”, with “areas of concern” including Bolton, Blackburn, Bedford and Hounslow in north-west London.Surge testing was being conducted in parts of west London on Saturday in response to the emergence of the Indian variant. People living and working in specific areas of Harrow, Ealing, Hillingdon and Brent will be advised to take a PCR test even if they do not have symptoms. Those who test positive for the variant are told to self-isolate and their contacts are traced.The PHE study took place between April 5, when the Indian variant emerged, to May 16. Some 12,675 genome-sequenced cases were included in the analysis, but only 1,054 were of the Indian variant.PHE found there were at least 2,889 cases of the Indian variant discovered this year. Of those, 104 cases resulted in a visit to a hospital emergency department, 31 required an overnight hospital admission and six resulted in death.The most common strain in England remains the Kent variant, with 132,082 cases recorded so far. Some 1,569 people have died with that strain.Throughout the UK, 71 per cent of adults have had their first vaccine, with 41 per cent – or 21 million people – protected with their second jab. The vaccine programme is estimated to have saved 13,000 lives and prevented 39,100 people from being hospitalised.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Britain’s vaccines are “highly effective” against the Indian coronavirus variant, government scientists hailed on Saturday night, putting the country back on course for a full reopening by June 21.In a marked change in tone, Public Health England (PHE) scientists said the first real-world data showed double doses of PfizerBioNTech or AstraZeneca were nearly as effective against the emerging Indian strain as they were against the Kent variant.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice Dominic Cummings has said the Government originally intended to let coronavirus rip through the community in an attempt to build herd immunity.The PMaposs former right hand man says the governmentaposs initial Covid strategy was herd immunity by September – and blasted claims to the contrary by Health Secretary Matt Hancock as bull****. No  has repeatedly denied it pursued the controversial tactic of allowing Covid- to spread unchecked. But in a series of tweets Mr Cummings said the idea was only abandoned in early March after Downing Street was warned it would lead to a catastrophe. He claimed herd immunity was literally the official plan in all docs graphs meetings until it was ditched.  Mr Cummingsapos latest intervention comes as he prepares to give evidence to MPs investigating the Governmentaposs response to the pandemic this week. He said all three country-wide lockdowns could have been entirely avoidedthere were competent people in charge and ministers had made the right preparations. He described the Governmentaposs strategy as AWOL disaster and claimed the first lockdown in March was only necessary because awful decisions were made. As well as accusing Health Secretary Mr Hancock of lying, Cummings attacked the media for accepting the Governmentaposs denials. He tweeted yesterday: Media generally abysmal on Covid but even Iaposve been surprised by one thing: how many hacks have parroted Hancockaposs line that aposherd immunity wasnapost the planapos when aposherd immunity by Septemberapos was aposliterally the official plan in all documents graphs meetingsapos until it was ditched.  Yes the media is often incompetent but something deeper is at work: much of SWwas happy to believe Hancockaposs bull**** that apositaposs not the planapos so they didnapost have to face the shocking truth. Most political hacks believe in aposthe systemapos... In week of March , No was made aware by ious people that the official plan would lead to catastrophe. It was then replaced by Plan B. But how aposherd immunity by Septemberapos could have been the plan until that week is a fundamental issue in the whole disaster. At the time, the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had said thatthey tried to suppress the disease very, very hard it would simply bounce back when restrictions were released.  Instead he suggested the aim was to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people were resistant to the disease and transmission was reduced. In his tweets, Mr Cummings said there had been so much lockdown confusion. Obviously theyaposre aposdestructiveapos. Butyou have to do it because alternative is aposhundreds of thousands choking to death and no NHS for months for everybody  and economy sunk because everybody hiding in terrorapos then earlier harder is better for health AND economy, he wrote. If weaposd had the right preparations and competent people in charge, we would probably have avoided lockdown , aposdefinitelyapos no need for lockdowns  and . Given the plan was AWOL disaster and awful decisions delayed everything, lockdown  became necessary.  The former top aide is said to be planning a devastating critique of the PMaposs leadership when he appears before a joint session of the health and science committees on Wednesday.No  has been bracing for the next attack from Cummings for some time, after he was accused of leaking messages from the PMaposs phone last month – and then went on the offensive. Cummings denied he was behind the leaks and launched a fierce tirade against his former boss – accusingBoris Johnson of unethical, foolishpossibly illegal behaviour. Cummings has reportedly spent weeks readying a store of secret documents that could deliver a devastating blow to Johnson.The ex-aide had access to some of the most confidential information in government before he was booted out last year.Responding to Mr Cummingsapos tweets, a government spokesperson said: Herd immunity has never been a policy aim or part of our coronavirus strategy.  Our response has at all times been focused on saving lives and ensuring the NHS was not overwhelmed. We continue to be guided by the latest scientic advice. Last month, he attacked the PMaposs competence and integrity in an online blog post. Mr Cummings left No  in November last year after an apparent deterioration of relations with Mr Johnson. The pair had been close allies on the Vote Leave campaign and Mr Cummings played a key role in the Tory election victory in  and the early days of Mr Johnsonaposs premiership.

He claimed a trip to Barnard Castle from his family farm - where he should have been isolating - was to test his eyesight.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnWestminsterNHSJohnsonsConservative PartyBoris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"voice sunday mirror pm valued","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Sunday Mirror: If PM valued NHS he would give pay rise they deserveNow NHS facing staffing catastrophe as almost half of all nurses say they are considering leaving profession as Jenny McGee, one of staff who nursed Boris back to health from Coronavirus, resignsmirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionThe PM insults nurses with his paltry pay offer \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Faced with the biggest public health crisis in a century, they showed remarkable dedication, compassion and professionalism. They worked around the clock to nurse those with Covid back to le, and to comfort those who sadly succumbed to the virus. These saints in scrubs risked their own lives to care for others, often working without the right protective kit. They tolerated the long hours, the stressful environment and the unyielding pressure as the price for doing a job they love. Each week, the public showed their appreciation by taking to their doorsteps to clap for the carers.Yet when it came to the Government to say thank you, it quickly shoved its hands back in its pockets. You’d have thought that Boris Johnson would have valued the brilliant NHS staff who nursed him back to health when he was in intensive care with coronavirus.

The health service was already short of , nurses before the pandemic struck. A mass exodus would be a hammer blow for morale, place more pressure on overstretched staff and leave patients without the care they need.  Scotland has offered its nurses a % pay rise on top of a £ thank-you bonus for working during the Covid outbreak. This is the least that staff working for NHS England deserve. This government cannot plead poverty. It had no problem finding £billion for the flawed test-and-trace system where lucrative contracts went to Conservative donors and cronies. If the Prime Minister really valued the NHS,he is genuinely grateful to the staff who tended to him, andhe wants the health service to continue to provide the best possible care, then he would give its staff the pay rise they deserve.  Once again we have reason to thank our brilliant scientists. Research shows that the vaccines are almost completely effective against the Indian iant of Covid. In the race between science and the virus, science has once again triumphed. Yet there is no room for complacency. There can be no let-up in the delivery of the vaccination programme so that as many people get their second jabs as possible.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSBoris JohnsonCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine"},{"url":null,"title":"coronation street approached story based","story":"NewsCoronation Street approached me to do a story based on my daughters murderCoronation Street viewers were recently left reeling by the death of Seb Franklin after he and goth girlfriend Nina Lucas were set upon by a gangmirrorShareComments\"BySylvia Lancaster :,  MAY NewsSophie and Rob had just moved in together \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Dont miss out on the biggest soaps gossip!

Here, Sophie’s mum Sylvia, from Rossendale, Lancashire, tells her story and explains why she decided to collaborate with the soap’s writers…“When Coronation Street ’s Nina was attacked and beaten for the way she dressed, and her boyfriend Seb was killed, I knew it would be hard for fans of the soap to watch.But seeing the story play out on screen has been especially hard for me, because in , my precious daughter Sophie really was beaten to death and her boyfriend seriously injured simply because of the way they were dressed. Sophie had just hit her teens when she first started dressing in the goth way. She dyed her hair jet black and styled it in dreadlocks, and she wore a dog collar around her neck. She’d come home pleased with the latest black dress she’d bought or show off a new face piercing. I thought she looked beautul and very cool. At just over ft and very petite, she’d always been such a quiet, shy girl, so I was pleased that she was learning to express herself. Her new look seemed to give her more confidence.  Growing up, she was a home-loving girl who loved reading. I can still picture her as a toddler, sitting there holding a book upside down. Reading became a passion we shared and she was never happier than when she was curled up on the sofa, a book in one hand, a Coke or a chocolate bar in the other.Her favourite was the Harry Potter series, which she started reading as a young girl. She was always nagging me to read them, although I resisted. “Mum, they’re brilliant,” she’d say.When she started seeing her boyfriend, Rob Maltby, he walked an hour to the shop and back just to buy her the final Harry Potter instalment. I’m so glad she got to read that before she died. Like Sophie, Rob dressed like a goth, with long, dyed black hair and face piercings. They certainly made a striking pair. Working in youth services, I was aware that kids who dressed like them received a bit of abuse. I worried that Sophie might get some hassle, but I thought it might only be a few taunts, never what ended up happening.  Sophie and Rob were both bright and creative. Rob was a gentle soul who was studying art, and although Sophie had a place to study for an English degree, she decided to have a gap year first as she didn’t feel ready for college. Meanwhile, she worked at HMV, a job she absolutely loved. They moved in together when Sophie was  and Rob was , and I was really pleased for them. Sophie seemed so happy and was growing in confidence by the day. The last time I saw her, she and Rob came over for her weekly visit to me and her brother Adam, who was  at the time. I remember her curled up on the sofa with Rob, making a fuss of my cats and we talked about music. Driving them home later, something made me say, “Be careful walking around in the dark around here.” I knew the way they looked stuck out in the small town of Bacup where they were living. “I’m not that stupid, Mum, don’t worry,” Sophie reassured me. I barely recognised her A week later, on Saturday morning,  August , I’d just popped out to the shops to buy food for her visit the next day when I got a call from Sophie’s brother Adam. Sophie had been attacked and was in intensive care in hospital. The police said a group of teenagers at Stubbylee Park had started calling Sophie and Rob freaks. Then they attacked Rob, beating and kicking him until he lost consciousness. As Sophie cradled his head and tried to make them stop, they attacked her, punching her and kicking her in the head. When I got to the hospital and saw Sophie lying there, connected to tubes and machines, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. She’d been so badly beaten I barely recognised her. Her head and face were swollen and she was black and blue. There were even trainer marks on the side of her face where they’d kicked her head like a football. It was horric. Five teenagers aged from  to  were charged with the attacks on Sophie, , and Robert, . Ryan Herbert, then , and Brendan Harris, , were sentenced to le for murder and three others received between four months and five years for grievous bodily harm. The judge told them that their behaviour “degrades humanity itself..it raises serious questions about the sort of society which exists in this country”. Herbert will be eligible for parole next year. I just couldn’t understand how anyone could do this to another human being. The doctors were hopeful she’d recover, but as she lay there motionless, I felt helpless. I talked to her or read to her from her Harry Potter books, willing her to wake up. Knowing how important her hair was to her, I gently waxed her dreadlocks, as she’d shown me, and a nurse helped me to wash her, which felt very special. We heard that Rob had woken from his coma and was likely to make a full recovery, but Sophie’s condition worsened. Finally, after a series of scans, we were told she wouldn’t recover. Her brain was too badly damaged. Thirteen days after the attack, the machines keeping her alive were turned off. I held her in my arms as she died, telling her I loved her, that I’d miss her forever and that I’d do everything I could to stop this happening again. Such a waste Everyone was distraught – Adam, Sophie’s dad, the nurses. It was such a waste of a brilliant young le, just for dressing dferently. Hundreds turned out for Sophie’s funeral. What had happened seemed to have struck a chord and we had huge support, which really helped me through those first days after her death.  Two of the teenagers were sentenced to le for what they did to Sophie and three others were jailed for grievous bodily harm. I’ve tried to put them out of my mind – they don’t deserve my attention, but I’ll always be linked with them. Every now and then I’ll hear about one of them appealing their sentence or doing a course in prison, and I think, “My Sophie couldn’t do her course.” I can’t forgive them.  I threw all my energy into starting up the Sophie Lancaster Foundation. Adam works with me there. Like me, he’s struggled to come to terms with his sister’s death. We go to schools and colleges and talk about hate crime and alternative subcultures, such as goths.We’ve had so much support. Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, who played me in a play about Sophie, is a patron, as is Vicky McClure from Line Of Duty .But with hate crime against alternative subcultures on the rise, there’s so much more work to do. If we can change a single young mind or challenge a prejudice, then it’s worth all the effort.When the Coronation Street producers first approached me about using Sophie’s story as inspiration for a plot line, I wasn’t sure what to think. But I talked to them about what they wanted to achieve and I was involved throughout to advise. Sophie’s death still feels very raw to me. I think about her every day and feel that she’s always with me. Little things set me off.Hearing Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol has me in floods of tears – it was one of her favourite songs and we played it at her funeral. Or I’ll see someone who looks just like her and my heart lurches.On her birthdays and the anniversary of her death, the foundation organises events, but I also go on my own to her grave. I’m so proud that she stayed with Rob and tried to save him, but of course another part of me wishes she’d run away.I hope that seeing the Coronation Street story will make people think about what happened to Sophie and how we must all make sure it never happens again. The message still needs to be heard.”In , Sylvia Lancaster received an OBE in recognition of her campaign to promote a more tolerant society.

Two doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca jabs give only slightly less protection than against the dominant Kent strain. But one jab is only % effective – prompting a scramble to deliver more. The battle is on to give people two coronavirus jabs after ­scientists revealed tonight that a double dose is highly ­effective against the new ­mutant Indian strain. Two doses of Pfizer or AstraZeneca deliver only slightly less protection than against the dominant Kent strain. Public Health England revealed the good news as soldiers from the Royal Horse Artillery joined the fight against the Indian iant.  They went door to door with leaflets to encourage Covid vaccination uptake in the virus hot spot of Halliwell in Bolton, Lancs. According to PHE, the Pfizer vaccine is % effective against symptoms of the iant after a second shot, compared with % against the Kent strain. The research – which came as England today passed  million vaccinations – was heralded as ­groundbreaking by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. The number of Brits who have had their first jab is nearly  million while . million have had two. Mr Hancock said: “We can now be confident that over  million people – more than one in three – have signicant protection against this new iant, and that number is growing by the hundreds of thousands every single day.”  But scientists tonight sounded a note of caution as it emerged both vaccines are just % effective against symptoms of the Indian iant after one dose. One shot of either vaccine delivers % protection against the Kent iant ­after three weeks. Scientists called on ministers to speed up the jabs roll-out to get doses dished out as fast as possible. Currently, the last remaining lockdown restrictions, including social distancing and masks, are set to be scrapped on June .  Prof Christina Pagel of the Independent Sage  of scientists told the Sunday People: “It is obviously good news that two doses offer very good protection. “However, one dose is not very effective from either vaccine against symptomatic disease, which is not good for the roadmap. “Given that efficacy is much higher after two doses, it seems the best option is to, at the very least, delay step four of the roadmap until all adults have been offered two doses of the vaccine. “Depending on vaccine ­availability this could be ­somewhere between late August and late September.” As of Thursday there were , documented cases of the Indian iant – officially known as B.. – up by , in a week. Six people have so far died from the strain and  taken to AE, ­according to PHE.  The Kent iant is still far more common, with , deaths since February . But experts have found that it is now being displaced in parts of London and the North West. The study looked solely at how effective the vaccines are at preventing symptoms. But scientists believe the jabs will provide even higher levels of protection against ­hospitalisation and death. This week, PHE said real-world studies found the AstraZeneca jab delivered % protection from Covid generally, a fraction less than Pfizer’s %. Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE head of immunisation, said: “This study provides reassurance that two doses of either vaccine offer high levels of protection against symptomatic ­disease from the B.. iant. “We expect the vaccines to be even more effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, so it is vital to get both doses to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging iants.”  But % of adults have not yet had their first jab and six in ten have not had a second shot. The NHS today opened up vaccine ­appointments to people who turn  before July. Areas where the Indian iant is a major concern, such as Bolton, Blackburn and Bedford, have also ramped up their vaccine schemes to all over-s. For over-s and those with health conditions, the initial -week gap between jabs has shortened to eight weeks. But supply issues mean it is unlikely that under-s will get second doses any earlier. Under-s are being offered alternative to AstraZeneca because of a link to rare blood clots.Prof Martin McKee, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “While vaccines are extremely important in controlling the pandemic they are not­ ­completely effective. “We need to maintain great caution given the very worrying rise in infections with the B.. iant. “Those who argue that we no longer have to worry because we have made so much progress in vaccination are wrong.” Prof McKee, also an Independent Sage member, added: “The low protection among people with only one dose is worrying. The Government seems to recognise it is taking a big risk by opening up according to its timetable and is, rightly, calling on people to be cautious. “Only time will tellit has made a mistake.” Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia, said: “The main thing we can do to reduce the spread of this iant is to ensure that we get our second dose of vaccine.” Scientists tonight confirmed they are examining a new “triple mutant” Covid iant with a strange ­combination of genes.

When Ethan Adams, , began suffering from a pain in his mouth, his family assumed it was a dental problem and took him to get some fillings put in. But the sensation persisted and was later worsened by the appearance of a lump on the roof of his mouth. After several trips to the dentist Ethan was referred to hospital for further tests, where he and his family received the devastating news that it was in fact a tumour. Doctors also told the family that the cancer tragically spread to the youngsteraposs spine, lungs and bone marrow. In December last year, Ethan was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma - a rare type of cancer that forms in soft tissue. But his dad says heaposs never complained once and is battling the gruelling disease with fighting spirit.Ethan’s dad Mark, from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, told Chronicle Live : “It was awful news.It was a huge surprise but thankfully he has been undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy.  “He was just a normal, happy go lucky kid and then all of a sudden we were surprised at how quick it gripped him because within a couple of weeks he was turned very poorly. “He is a very sociable character, always has a smile on his face and he keeps everybody going.

He’s faced everything head on and been so brave and just got on with it.” Ethan was receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the same time and he successfully finished both treatments two weeks ago. But the intense treatments have now taken their toll on the little fighter, leaving him with temporary inflammation on his brain. From sleeping over  hours a day to constantly being sick, brave Ethan is now strongly battling through the side effects of his treatments. He even managed to give a thumbs up to the camera while he recovered from the gruelling aftermath in hospital.  During this challenging time, Ethanaposs parents Mark and Tracey have received lots of support from Children Cancer North. Dad-of-three Mark added: “The charity has been great. They are unsung heroes because a lot of people are involved in dferent things that have helped keep Ethan going. As part of the charityaposs work, a group of children including Ethan got together with a local author, Jenny Pearson, to write a poem about their experience of the disease.

Our exclusive snap shows him getting on with Karen Roche-Pearson’s housework. Karen, , told the Sunday Mirror Bashir he “totally lied” to get her to appear on the BBC show. And the maternity nurse is relishing seeing HIS dirty linen being aired in public. Karen, courted by Bashir two years after his Panorama interview with Princess Diana, said: “He was such a creep and would ­pretend to be nice by doing my ironing. He’d say, ‘Oh, let me do that for you’.  “He comes across so nice, but he’s a nasty piece of work.” Karen claims Bashir got her to open up by promising her kids toys. He pursued her for an show after she agreed to be a surrogate for £, but ended up keeping the baby, leading to a historic legal fight with the other couple. But Karen, of Beverley, East Yorks, says Bashir betrayed her after promising the  show would portray her as the victim. She claims he said, “Trust me, I did the Diana interview,” but in the end the show “wasn’t what he said it was going to be”.  “It was supposed to be on my side, the way he did it – he just totally lied. “I was a big fan of Diana and he was saying, ‘I did the famous Diana interview’.” Karen says she turned down a large sum from a rival ITV documentary. She said: “I thought, ‘It’s Panorama, it’s the BBC, it’s going to get the truth over and nobody will doubt it.  “I wanted people to know I had gone into it for the right reasons and I’d done nothing wrong, but that didn’t happen.” Karen added: “He’s not what he presents himself as.

They hit the jackpot after their postcode,NP LG, in the Welsh town of New Tredegar, was drawn as a big winner.And theyaposre already planning a bumper street party to celebrate the le-changing news. Among the winners are an NHS nurse, a set of relations and a winner who recently suffered heartbreak at the hands of covid. Support worker Gareth Walbeoff, , lost his father to the pandemic in January. He said: My poor mum was having to isolate for  days, so only I could go to console her, none of the other family could go. “Then she unfortunately fell and broke her back, she’s up and about now and my niece is taking her to a hospital appointment today. My niece is really good to mum, I couldn’t manage without her. She’s got three children and my nephew has a little girl as well. What I’m going to do is pay for all these kids to have a good holiday in a big -star, luxury caravan in Tenby for two weeks!  He also congratulated his neighbours and added: “In this street we all are like one big family. When it’s safe to do so we’re going to have one hell of a street party!”Gareth wasn’t the only member of his family to get a call from lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson . One of the other winners was -year-old Alan Vaughan whose partner, Nicola, is Gareth’s cousin.Another winner from the street was NHS nurse Tina Watkinswho learned of her windfall while on a break at work. As the cheque was revealed, the -year-old clapped with joy and said: “Woo!  grand! Oh that’s fantastic, thank you very much!” Her co-workers cheered on hearing the total and Tina said she would buy her manager, who was holding Tina’s camera phone over the call, ‘a nice big cake.’ Tina already had plans for some of her winnings: She added: “I’ve got a house renovation going on, so I can plough it into that and buy my son a car. What a lovely surprise, I can finish off what I want to do with the house without having to save. “Maybe a holiday next year. Our holiday to Fuerteventura was cancelled this year, but we might go further afield now.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson sent his congratulations to all the winners. He said: “What a fantastic surprise for our winners in New Tredegar! I can tell it is a really close community, so I was thrilled to bring this great news. “Congratulations to them and all our other winners today, I’m sure they’ll enjoy their winnings.” Everyday throughout the April draws one postcode was announced as a £, prize winner. All the players in the postcode won £, for every ticket they hold. People’s Postcode Lottery costs £ a month to play and there are guaranteed winners every day. People play with their chosen postcode and are automatically entered into all draws.A minimum of % of ticket sales goes directly to charities and players of People’s Postcode Lottery have helped raise over £ million to date for thousands of good causes across Britain and internationally.

Kayleigh Stephens, , has been trying to conceive with her husband, Nathan Stephens, for  years - but suffered health issues including an eating disorder and a cyst that got in the way. And after two failed rounds of IVF treatment, her dream of having children looked even further away from becoming a reality. But thanks to her heroic younger sister, Shauna Smith, she may have found the answer sheaposs been searching for.Mum-of-three Shauna told of how heartbreaking is it to watch her sister cry every day because she canapost have children, Teesside Live reports.The sisters, who both live in Lingdale, are just beginning their journey but have shared their story to raise awareness of the struggles some couples face in conceiving.  Kayleigh, a reablement assistant in a rehabilitation centre, said: Since being a teenager Iaposve always wanted kids. About  years ago, me and my husband started trying for kids. We tried for about two years and nothing happened and we werenapost falling pregnant. We decided to go to the doctors to seethere was anything wrong. We were referred to [hospital] and my husbandaposs tests came back fine - there was no issues with him. Kayleigh underwent keyhole surgery to investigate the matter further. The operation revealed that her fallopian tubes were blocked and she had a cyst on her oy, along with a heart-shaped womb. After two rounds of IVF, she became depressed and developed an eating disorder which added to the dficulties and saw her rapidly shed  dress sizes in three months.  I lost quite a lot of weight quite quickly - I went from a size  to a size six in around three months, she said. I was constantly exercising and living on caffeine. It was affecting my work too. Kayleigh was diagnosed with anorexia and put on a course of treatment including medications and therapy, after which her condition began to improve. Now her health problems are starting to look better, sheaposs thinking about the future. She says that because her eggs arenapost good quality, the couple decided not to go ahead with another cycle of IVF.  Adoption was another option, but Shauna then stepped in and offered the greatest gt a sister can give - by agreeing to be a surrogate. Kayleigh explained: My sister offered to be my surrogate but we were looking at between £, to £, for one cycle of treatment. Thataposs a lot of money for me and my partner so weaposve researched and weaposre going to do surrogacy from home. My sister is doing ovulation tests and weaposre doing the insemination at home.  The family say it is legal to undertake and Nathan will be the biological father of the baby, giving him parental rights from birth. Kayleigh will then legally adopt the baby after six-months. Shauna told how she has previously fallen pregnant easily and sailed through her pregnancies. She told how it was very dficult when she had her two youngest children as she knew how heartbreaking it was for Kayleigh. Shauna added: I actually feel better when Iaposm pregnant, I feel healthier. Kayleigh has asked before and Iaposve said no because Iaposve had my own kids. But now Iaposm  per cent sure I donapost want any more. Itaposs going to be dficult and Iaposm scared but I know itaposs not going to happen overnight.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBabiesHospitalsPregnancySurrogacyFertilityIVF"},{"url":null,"title":"government controlling who you can","story":"NewsopinionGovernment controlling who you can hug and when is crazy, time for us to open our armsWhen we were told that we could at last hug again on May , I wanted to hug away, but I realised that just because I wanted to hug didn’t mean that everybody  would be comfortable with itmirrorShareCommentsBySaira Khan:,  MAY NewsopinionSaira Khan finally gets to hug her mum\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The urge for human contact is a strong instinct, and to deny it or control it incurs anxiety and stress. I’m a serial hugger myself. I hug my kids, my hubby and my dog every day. And it’s those hugs that have kept me sane throughout lockdown. At least we had each other. But what about all those people who live alone and those self-isolating due to their vulnerable status  Some of these people haven’t been able to hug others for nearly  months. Care home residents have had to resort to just waving at their loved ones through windows. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  I’ve never looked into the psychology of hugging – I just know that it makes me feel loved, it’s a pick-me-up, it gives feelings of belonging and allows me to show others I’m a warm person. Professor Robin Dunbar, evolutionary psychologist at the University of Oxford, explains how touch is “really fundamental” for humans, and going without it “weakens our close relationships”. So when we were told that we could at last hug again on May , I wanted to hug away. I met up with friends I’d not seen since lockdown, and my immediate instinct was to fling my arms around them and squeeze hard. But I didn’t.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Instead I asked: “Are you hugging  Have you tested  Have you been vaccinated ” I realised that just because I wanted to hug didn’t mean that everybody  would be comfortable with it. I wanted to respect their space, feelings and experience of Covid. However, to my delight, all my friends were up for a hug – and it was just wonderful. We all held on to each other a little longer than normal and a little bit harder. But the person I was most looking forward to hugging was my mum. She came to stay after  months of selfisolating, and I flung my arms a round her, holding on for dear le. For the first few days my -year-old mum was a little awkward with physical contact. It’s not that she didn’t want to hug, she’d forgotten how to, and didn’t knowshe should. However, it only took a few days of her grandkids cuddling her before she was back to her normal huggy self.  There’s no doubt that one of the simplest ways to reduce the stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic is to hug. Butyou’re feeling nervous about embracing, perhaps the following government guidance will help – keep hugs short, turn your faces away, wear a mask to hug a vulnerable person and do it outside. It’s done wonders for my own mental health, so I urge you all to open your arms...FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnUniversity of OxfordCare homesMental healthNursing homesCoronavirus lockdownCoronavirusRelationshipsSaira Khan"},{"url":null,"title":"know indian covid variant including","story":"NewsAll we know about Indian Covid iant including hotspots and who is catching itNew data was revealed in a Public Health England study which looked at , cases of the Indian iant and found the Pfizer vaccine is  per cent effective against it after two dosesmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News ReporterLuke Powell:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-says-vaccine-effective-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:uzZSdAz,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

All but  Indian iant cases included in the study involved people with a history of travel. The new figures were revealed in a Public Health Englandstudy which looked at the efficacy of Covid- vaccines against the Indian iant of concern, formally known as B.... Of the , sequenced cases included in the study, which took place between April  and May , , involved the Indian iant.  The latest weekly data from PHE showed there were , cases of the B... mutation, an increase of , on the previous week. While most cases were concentrated in the North West – particularly Bolton – and London, PHE said it was seeing “clusters of cases” across the country. The mutation is expected to become the UKaposs dominant iant. Surge testing is now being introduced to parts of west London after cases of the Indian coronavirus iant were detected there. People living and working in specic areas of Harrow, Ealing, Hillingdon and Brent will be advised to take a PCR test eventhey do not have symptoms.  Dr Meera Chand, the Covid- incident director at PHE, said it was essential people in the worst-affected areas who had yet to receive their second dose of the vaccine came forward as soon as it was offered. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday that while the iant seemed more transmissible, the evidence suggested vaccines were effective against it.Here is what we know about the PHE study and the Indian iant.What does the new data show  The Pfizer coronavirus vaccine is  per cent effective against the Indian iant after two doses, the study by Public Health Englandfound. Both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs were found to be almost as effective against symptomatic disease from the Indian iant as they are against the Kent iant after the second dose. However, they were only  per cent effective three weeks after the first dose. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the outcome as “groundbreaking”, while PHE said it expects to see even higher levels of effectiveness against hospital admission and death. The study, which took place between April  and May , found that the Pfizer vaccine was  per cent effective against symptomatic disease from the Indian iant two weeks after the second dose, compared with  per cent effectiveness against the Kent strain.

Meanwhile, the AstraZeneca jab was  per cent effective, compared with  per cent against the Kent iant over the same period. Both vaccines were  per cent effective against symptomatic disease from the Indian iant three weeks after the first dose, compared with about  per cent against the Kent strain. Some , genome-sequenced cases were included in the analysis, but only , were of the Indian iant. The study included data for all age groups from April  to cover the period since the strain emerged. PHE said the dference in the effectiveness between the vaccines may be due to the AstraZeneca second dose being rolled out later than the Pfizer vaccine. Data also shows it takes longer for the AstraZeneca jab to reach maximum effectiveness. There are insufficient cases and follow-up periods to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes from the Indian iant but this will be evaluated over the coming weeks, PHE added.  How many people have died  Cases of the Indian iant of coronavirus in the UK have risen by more than , in the space of a week, according to figures from Public Health England . The latest weekly data showed there were , cases of the B. mutation – an increase of , on the previous week. From February  to May ,  cases resulted in a visit to a hospital emergency department,  required an overnight hospital admission and six resulted in a death. At least  local authorities are now reporting five or more confirmed cases, ministers have said. It has become the dominant iant in parts of the North West. Who is catching the iant  The study found that . per cent of the , Indian iant cases in the study a history of travel. The - age group reported the most cases , followed by - , -and - . By gender,  per cent of those infected with the iant were male. The study also had a breakdown by ethnicity, finding that . per cent of those with the Indian iant identied as white, followed by people who identied as Indian or British Indian . The North West had the highest number of Indian iant cases , followed by London , the East Midlands , and the East of England . What does the data mean for June  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said the iant could pose a “serious disruption to our progress” coming out of lockdown.Asked about how the data could affect the easing of restrictions from June , Professor Susan Hopkins, PHE’s Covid- strategic response director, said it was “too early to say”. She said: “One week post the last restriction lting, we will be monitoring it very carefully.” Mr Hancock said: “This new evidence is groundbreaking and proves just how valuable our Covid- vaccination programme is in protecting the people we love. “We can now be confident that over  million people – more than one in three – have signicant protection against this new iant, and that number is growing by the hundreds of thousands every single day as more and more people get that vital second dose.” Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, added: “This study provides reassurance that two doses of either vaccine offer high levels of protection against symptomatic disease from the B. iant. “We expect the vaccines to be even more effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, so it is vital to get both doses to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging iants.” Responding to the findings, Professor Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol said: “Overall the results are encouraging in that the vaccines are continuing to provide useful protection. “However, protection after the first dose appears to be reduced to a potentially important degree.” Separate analysis by PHE indicates that the vaccination programme has so far prevented , deaths and about , hospital admissions in older people in England, up to May .Latest figures show that more than  million doses of coronavirus vaccine have now been given in England.What is being done to combat the spread  A range of measures are being taken to tackle its spread, including accelerating second doses of vaccines for people over  and the clinically vulnerable. Surge testing has been launched in a number of areas where cases have been found. Almost  have been found in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen, where it is now the dominant strain. Cases there were rising in all age groups after doubling in a week. So far, hospitals have not been overwhelmed by the rise in cases of the iant. Is the Indian iant more transmissible  Informing MPs of the latest scientic assessment on the Indian iant, the Health Secretary said last Monday early evidence suggested the iant was more transmissible than the Kent iant. He added that it was not yet known how much more transmissible it was. The Scientic Advisory Group for emergencieshas said there is a “realistic possibility” that the Indian coronavirus iant could be as much as “ per cent more transmissible” than the Kent strain. But, at present, there is no evidence the iant is resistant to current vaccines.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPfizer Inc.HospitalsCoronavirusPeriodsAstraZeneca plcMutant CoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine"},{"url":null,"title":"martin bashir says loved princess","story":"NewsMartin Bashir says he loved Princess Diana and was in no way responsible for her deathThe shamed former BBC journalist, who a report found tricked Princess Diana into agreeing to her infamous Panorama interview in  by using fake bank statements, apologised to William and HarrymirrorShareCommentsByLaura Harding:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video william-harry-condemn-bbcs-handling-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:WpWsOK,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Bashir said he never wanted to harm Diana, Princess of Wales, with the Panorama interview, adding: I donapost believe we did. He apologised to Princes William and Harry, but also disputed the formeraposs claim that his conduct increased her isolation and paranoia. Bashiraposs reputation is in tatters following Lord Dysonaposs report that he used deceitful behaviour to land his world exclusive  interview. And in an extraordinary intervention, the Duke of Cambridge attacked the BBC and rogue reporter Bashir for failing his mother with the interview, which he demanded should never be shown again.  Speaking to the Sunday Times, Bashir maintained Diana was never unhappy about the content of the interview and said they continued to be friends after the broadcast, with the princess even visiting his we Deborah at St Georgeaposs hospital in Tooting, south London, on the day Deborah gave birth to the coupleaposs third child, Eliza. He told the newspaper: I never wanted to harm Diana in any way and I donapost believe we did. Everything we did in terms of the interview was as she wanted, from when she wanted to alert the palace, to when it was broadcast, to its contents ... My family and I loved her. He said he is deeply sorry to the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex, but disputes Williamaposs charge that he fuelled her isolation and paranoia. He said: Even in the early s, there were stories and secretly recorded phone calls. I wasnapost the source of any of that.  Dianaaposs brother, Earl Spencer, has said he draws a line between the interview and his sisteraposs death, claiming Bashiraposs actions led her to give up her royal security detail. Bashir, who left the BBC last week due to ill health, said: I donapost feel I can be held responsible for many of the other things that were going on in her le, and the complex issues surrounding those decisions. I can understand the motivation [of Earl Spenceraposs comments] but to channel the tragedy, the dficult relationship between the royal family and the media purely on to my shoulders feels a little unreasonable ... The suggestion I am singularly responsible I think is unreasonable and unfair. Bashir commissioned documents purporting to show payments into the bank accounts of members of the royal household and showed them to Earl Spencer, according to Lord Dyson.  He said: Obviously I regret it, it was wrong. But it had no bearing on anything. It had no bearing on [Diana], it had no bearing on the interview. He said he is now concerned the scandal will overshadow the content of what Diana said in the interview. She was a pioneering princess. When you think about her expressions of grief in her marriage, when you think about the admission of psychiatric illness - just extraordinary! And her sons have gone on to champion mental health, he said. I donapost understand what the purpose of this is ultimately  OK, maybe you want to destroy me, but outside of this, whataposs the point  I did something wrong . . . but for pityaposs sake, acknowledge something of the relationship we had and something of what she contributed through that interview.  One of the saddest things about all of this has been the way the content of what she said has almost been ignored. Bashiraposs comments come after former BBC director-general Lord Tony Hall quit as chairman of the National Gallery after he was heavily criticised in the Dyson report for his botched inquiry into how the interview was obtained. His resignation comes after another former BBC executive involved in the  internal investigation, Tim Suter, announced on Friday that he was stepping down from his board role with media watchdog Ofcom. Earl Spencer is reported to have written to politan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking her to investigate the BBC. Scotland Yard has already said that it will assess Lord Dysonaposs findings to determine whether they contain any signicant new evidence. Lord Hall, who in  was director of BBC news and current affairs, led the investigation which exonerated Bashir, even though he had previously admitted lying about the fake documents he used in obtaining the interview.

He was director-general when Bashir was controversially rehired by the BBC as religious affairs correspondent in  and later promoted to religion editor. The chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Julian Knight, has called on current director-general Tim Davie to provide a full explanation as to how Bashir came to be re-employed. Mr Knight said that some people may suspect that the journalist was given the religion job as a way of keeping quiet about what exactly he knew. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme the BBC should now consider paying compensation to whistleblowers who had had their careers damaged after raising concerns about the way Bashir had operated. Mr Knight said there was a need for further reform at the BBC, and he called for a strengthening of editorial policy within the corporation. Mr Davie wrote to BBC staff on Friday saying: I know that we now have signicantly stronger processes and governance in place to ensure that an event like this doesnapost happen again. However we must also learn lessons and keep improving.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrince WilliamEarl SpencerMartin BashirPrincess DianaCressida DickBBCScotland YardPanoramaR TodayBanksHospitalsRoyal FamilyMental health"},{"url":null,"title":"miracle lockdown twins survive two","story":"NewsMiracle lockdown twins survive two le-saving operations inside the wombEXCLUSIVE: Sisters Flo and Amelia Rich­ford were conceived through IVF in a race against time as clinics prepared to close when lockdown kicked in last yearmirrorShareCommentsByLucy Laing:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsFlo and Amelia are happy and healthy despite their ordeal \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And while the seven-month-old pair are both healthy and happy, parents Hanna and James are still recovering from the agonies they went through to get them here. The sisters were conceived through IVF in a race against time as clinics prepared to close when lockdown kicked in last year. With just  hours to go, a single embryo was successfully implanted in Hanna’s womb. Hanna said: “It was a tense  hours, but we managed it. Two weeks later we had a positive pregnancy test. “A few weeks after that we had a scan showing it was twins.” What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  That was especially poignant as the couple had started trying for a family in  and had conceived twins naturally – but lost them eight weeks into the pregnancy. Hanna, , said: “We couldn’t believe it. After losing our twins the first time it seemed asthese twins had been sent as a gt. “I’d only had one embryo put in my womb yet it had split into two. It was as though it was meant to be.” Her pregnancy went smoothly until she was  weeks pregnant. Doctors told her the girls had a rare condition called Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome .  An uneven blood flow means one twin receives almost all the nutrients while the other gets very few. It can be le-threatening for both babies. Hanna explained: “We’d been warned this was possible because they were identical and shared a placenta. “But it was still a shock – everything had gone so well up until  weeks.” The condition came on so quickly and was so serious that within hours Hanna was being rushed into the operating theatre at St George’s Hospital, London. She was warned the surgery could kill either or both twins – yet it was also their only chance of survival. But as both pulled through, the ­couple’s joy turned to horror within days. Hanna and James were told the girls had a second le-threatening condition and would need another operation.  This time they had been diagnosed with Twin Anaemia Polycythemia Sequence , where one twin becomes very anaemic and the other gets overloaded with blood. Hanna said: “It was devastating news. We’d been warned about the TTTS but no one had mentioned the possibility of TAPS as it’s so rare. It was too much to take in – it was terrying. “We both thought we couldn’t go through this heartache again, not knowingthey’d survive. “But it was their only chance so we had no choice – they had to have it.”  Hanna was taken down for the op and the couple faced an agonising wait to seethe girls had survived. With the surgery complete, a scan showed two heartbeats. Both twins had made it through for a second time. Hanna adds: “It was such a relief. To think they’d survived surgery twice in the womb was just a miracle.” With two operations already under their belt, Flo and Amelia were born safely in October last year. Hanna said: “They’ve been through so much. They were so unlucky to have had both conditions – it’s incredibly rare.”  The couple’s journey to parenthood has been a long one. Hanna, of Bisley, Surrey, said of her first distressing pregnancy four years ago: “I’d found out I was pregnant, and when I went for a check at eight weeks they told me both heartbeats had stopped. It was devastating.” The couple kept on trying for a family but were diagnosed with unexplained fertility after three years. They were about to start IVF when lockdown was announced. Hanna said: “To be told we had unexplained infertility was heartbreaking as I’d been able to get pregnant that first time. “It didn’t give us any reasons or answers as to why I wasn’t able to get pregnant again naturally. We knew then that IVF was going to be our only option, but then the clinics announced they were closing down, just as we were about to have our treatment. “We’d pinned so much of our hopes and dreams on it going ahead. It was the only way we were ever going to become parents.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

But they had waited so long for a family that they were determined to have their embryo implanted. The twins were born when Hanna was  weeks pregnant at the end of October last year – Amelia weighing lboz, and Flo at lb. They spent just two weeks in hospital before being allowed home. Hanna said: “They’re doing so well now. They have an unbreakable bond. “Flo is the cuddly one who is outgoing, and Amelia’s the shy one. When they’re older we’ll tell them what a pair of lockdown miracles they really are.” A spokeswoman for the Twins Trust said: “To have both conditions like this is extremely rare. “It’s thanks to the brilliant medical team that the twins have survived and are doing so well.” Risk sharing one placenta TTTS is a rare condition affecting identical twins – who often share one placenta and the network of blood vessels that supply them with oxygen and nutrients. It arises when one twin gets too little flow of blood and nutrients and the other gets too much, putting both at risk of heart failure. If untreated, the twins have a  per cent risk of death. TAPS is also a rare condition affecting identical twins when the placenta is shared. It occurs when there are unequal counts of red blood cells. The result is that one twin develops anaemia – too little haemoglobin bringing oxygen to the blood – while the other suffers an overload, known as polycythemia, putting a strain on the heart.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHospitalsPregnancyTwinsIVFFertilitySunday People"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

For they both carry the pain of almost unimaginable loss. Laura’s boyfriend Shane Gilmer died after being attacked by a crossbow maniac who also shot her in the head while five months pregnant. She was lucky to survive. Jenny’s six-year-old son Stanley Metcalf was shot in the stomach by his great-grandfather who has never apologised for the youngster’s death. But today the two women tell how they are helping each other through their sorrow – and how new baby daughters are helping them to heal. After her son’s death Jenny longed to have a baby and the arrival of Tilly, now  months, has not only given her and partner Andy Metcalf hope but the future, but also helped Stanley’s twin sister Elsie, nine, come to terms with her sense of emptiness.  Jenny says: “When I went into labour I took Stanley’s bear to hospital which had his ashes in it so it felt like he was looking over me the whole time. “As soon as Tilly arrived she came up onto my chest and turned her face towards me. It was a beautul moment, like Stanley was there and watching over us. “I was so sad because Stanley was gone but overjoyed that Tilly had been born. I turned to the bear and said ‘thank you, Stanley’” For Laura, it was the birth of Shane’s daughter Ella, now two, that gave her the courage to carry on too. Jenny and Laura, who live just nine miles apart, are now pouring their shared anguish into a crusade to make it illegal to own dangerous weapons without a licence.  Jenny’s football-mad son Stanley died in July  after the curious youngster asked her grandfather Albert Grannon to show him a modied air rle, which was unlicensed. After the gun went off, fatally injured Stanley’s final words were: “Why have you shot me, grandad ” The pellet left a hole the size of a p in his abdomen, but he suffered catastrophic internal bleeding. Six months earlier, Laura, , was shot in the head by deranged neighbour Anthony Lawrence. She watched Shane’s le slip away in front of her after a bolt embedded in his spine.  The women met after Jenny heard about Laura’s story on a regional TV news report following our exclusive interview with her last month. Jenny, , of Hull, says: “I just felt I had to reach out.” The pair want strict regulations to stop people owning weapons without a licence or checks on mental health. In the UK crossbows can easily be bought online for around £, while currently most air rles do not require owners to hold any certication. “We don’t want anyone to ever go through what we have,” says Jenny. “Laura and I both know what it’s like to feel that pain of losing someone in such a horrible way and how it always stays with you. It’s there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.”  At a park near Laura’s home the two women talk of how much they have in common how those first few months of loss “made it hard to do the simplest of things”, how they both suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress and are tormented by questions that may not be answered. While they have much to share, it’s clear to see they are at dferent stages of grieving. Laura is still angry that the love of her le was taken away in such a random act of brutality, while Jenny appears quieter, almost hollowed out by grief. Laura is still scarred from the night she found Lawrence hiding in the bedroom of her home in Southburn, near Drfield, Yorks, that it took her two years for her to live alone with Ella and daughter Isabelle, now nine. Even now she has removed every door from her upstairs rooms. “I know nothing like that is ever likely to happen again but I just need to be able to see inside every room from the top of the stairs. It helps me cope,” she explains.  “After Shane died I lived with family for months and months because I was too scared to live alone. I would have happily lived with them forever but I knew I had to get my own place eventually.” Both tried counselling in the weeks after the killings but neither were able to cope. Only now is Jenny getting help for the enormity of losing Stanley, made all the more dficult by the fact it was her own grandfather’s fault. Police said retired ship worker Grannon, known as Sam, “showed no real remorse” for shooting the youngster, initially refusing to accept responsibility by insisting he had been wounded by a ricochet. Ballistics tests later proved the pellet had been a direct hit.  Grannon, , was jailed three years after pleading guilty to manslaughter by gross negligence and the unauthorised possession of a gun in July . He was released in January. Jenny says: “I can’t believe he hasn’t apologised or shown any remorse after all this time. “For the first few weeks I defended him, then I’d hear he was in the pub with his mates and I started to get angry. I’d know him all my le and would say I was his favourite granddaughter, yet he’d killed my son and didn’t have a word to say about it. Nothing.” Laura’s twisted neighbour Lawrence, , killed himself in the days after the attack so there has been no court case and no answers as to why he went on his rampage.  Investigators believed he had spent a year listening to the couple through the walls of their semi-detached homes before breaking in through the loft and lying in wait for them. Laura is still tortured by her belief that Shane, , would have survived had ambulance staff not been delayed getting into their home while waiting for clearance from firearms officers. She says: “Shane died because he bled out. He was strong and stayed alive for almost three hours when he was shot. I keep asking myself what would have happenedhe’d have reached hospital earlier.” An inquest ruled the delays were sadly “inevitable”. A trauma specialist at the hearing also called his injuries “devastating”. Both women say they will never get over their trauma, but they also agree the birth of their babies has helped them rebuild their lives slowly.  Laura confesses: “I didn’t knowI’d be able to cope with bringing up Ella without Shane but she’s a part of him I still have. I look at her and she’s so like her daddy.” While Laura worried about bringing up her daughter alone, Jenny said despite having the support of Andy, he was “more reserved” about the idea of having another child because “he worried I wouldn’t be able to cope with any more lossthe IVF didn’t work out”. Jenny explains: “In the end we decided to have just one round of IVF and seeit was meant to be and it was. “Tilly isn’t a replacement for Stanley. I don’t want to replace him, but of course strange things go through your mind during pregnancy like ‘will the baby be Stanley reincarnated’.

We feel so lucky to have her.” And, as their daughters grow up, both women are determined that Shane and Stanley’s legacy will live on through a change in the law. “What happened was so horric, just indescribable really,” Jenny says. “But we are both determined to get the laws changed to protect others. Both our cases prove that new rules around weapons are needed and we are both determined to get there.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnGrievingCourt caseMental healthSunday PeopleGun crimeCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"parents dream sending girl 6","story":"NewsParents dream of sending girl, , with rare dementia to Disneyland after £k raisedPenny Mills, , was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome two years, which has already caused her to forget words she used to know - and will eventually take away her ability to walk and to swallowmirrorShareCommentsByKathie McInnes:,  MAY NewsPenny was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome two years ago \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Penny Mills, , was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome two years ago, which has already caused her to forget words she used to know.The condition will eventually take away her ability to walk and to swallow, reports StokeonTrentLive.Friends and family have now rallied to raised thousands of pounds for Penny, which it is hoped will be put towards a holiday. Some of the money has already gone on a wheelchair so the youngster, from Stafford, can go on hikes with her family.

It hadn’t occurred to me we might be told she may not live beyond her teens.” Her initial symptoms included hearing and speech dficulties, repeated nasal infections, diarrhoea and learning delay. Pennyaposs adenoids were removed and she was fitted with grommets, but neither helped her hearing or speech. She was also negatively tested for autism before reaching her true diagnosis. Kelly, who works as a veterinary nurse, added: “I’m very keen to raise awareness of Sanfilippo and other MPS diseases.

If doctors don’t know about them, diagnosis is delayed and children don’t get help as early as possible. “Secondly, some clinical trials are happening around the world into MPS, but they are largely funded by charities. We need more people to know about MPS for it to attract more research funding to help us find a cure for this terrible disease. Kelly and her husband Andrew, , have taken Penny around the world to try to get her into clinical trials, but she wasn’t accepted either time. She has also been supported by the Society for Mucopolysaccharide DiseasesBob Stevens, group chief executive, said: While choosing to shield and take treatment ‘holidays’ has kept many of our young people safe, we know some of our children have suffered from tiredness and pain. While our families have felt isolated, with increased mental and emotional health concerns. We also know that once our families feel confident enough to resume their lives, they will face longer waiting lists for referrals for diagnosis and treatment. That’s why MPS awareness week is very important this year - our families have taken every step to protect themselves and now we want to make sure their quality of le is improved.

The Duke of Sussex was furious at being unable to pay a separate personal tribute to his mother after the inquest in April , with the royal response instead covered by a statement from Prince Charles, claims Duncan Larcombe.Mr Larcombe, author of Prince Harry : The Inside Story, said Harry and William were at a stag do for cousin Peter Phillips on the Isle of Wight just two days later when it became clear Harry was not right.While many factors contributed to the tragic events in Paris, the High Court had concluded the People’s Princess died in an accident.  Writing for the Mirror, Mr Larcombe said: Something was not right with Harry. He was visibly rocking backwards and forwards on his feet. Under his arm was a piece of plastic pipe taped at one end by a large funnel. At one point Harry kneeled down, put the other end of the pipe in his mouth as a pals poured two pints of bitter down his neck. Even by Harry’s standards, this was a young royal drinking to oblivion. Mr Larcombe said Harry told him how he spoke to Harry at , trying to understand what was the matter with him. He added: Harry was furious at the official statement his ‘father’s people’ had issued on his behalf, welcoming the inquest findings.  As far as he was concerned he’d been forced into silence, denied the chance of paying a personal tribute to his beloved mother. When I plucked up the courage to ask him why he had not simply instructed the men in grey suits to issue a statement he was happy with, his answer remains ingrained in my memory. aposBecause they don’t work for me, they work for my father,apos Harry barked back. The author said he can vouch for Harryaposs version of events about what his le was like that he gave to Oprah Winfrey for her new Apple TV+ documentary. He added: Most people thought he was just Harry being Harry, enjoying a drink, a party a good night out.  But in reality, so much of Harry’s infamous hell-raising had a very dferent meaning to the young Royal. Whatever the public’s current view of Harry, the once popular Royal did have to cope with a great deal before he met Meghan. Senior royals are horried by his very public sessions in the psychiatrists chair. But they would do well to remember the role they played in letting their star act suffer in silence for so many years. Can they really blame Harry for wearing his heart on his sleeve, after all that’s the reason he held a special place in the hearts of the public since the age of .  Harry has levelled strong criticisms at the royal family in recent days, following on from previous comments that he had felt trapped. The Duke of Sussex appeared in a new documentary series The Me You Canapost See for Apple TV+ in which he made further damaging allegations against the firm. Speaking to Oprah Winfrey, he accused the royal family of total neglect and claimed his dad Prince Charles allowed him to suffer as a child in the face of the media.

The Queen was introduced to Paul Brookes, chief petty officer, , and son Morgan, a -year-old marine engineer and technician, who are both serving on HMS Queen Elizabeth. Paul, a father of six, said: The Queen certainly had a sparkle in her eye when she heard that Morgan and I were father and son and we are both serving on board at the same time. I think she liked that. I told her I was very proud.My youngest son is now getting a taste for joining the services, too, but he is thinking of the Army so I still need to persuade him over to the Navy. When presenting a medal for long service and good conduct for  years in the Royal Navy to Petty Officer Matthew Ready, , the Queen was told he had served on HMS Illustrious during a disaster relief mission to help those hit by typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were coming on board HMS Illustrious once when we had an accident with an aircraft on board. The Queen remembered it and said: aposI hope that wasn’t you or I shall have to ask for the medal back.apos Conversations with sailors recalled memories of the Queen’s own travels. Matthew Jones, , a leading seaman and maritime logistics chef currently on exchange from the Royal Australian Navy, told Her Majesty that his father, John Hones, had cooked for her and the Duke of Edinburgh on board the Royal Yacht Britannia.He said: I told her of a story he told me that when he was trying to use a pipe to make the call you do when dignitaries come aboard, the Queen gave him the tip that he needed to puff his cheeks out. When meeting a US Navy commander Andrew Plumber, from Hawaii, he askedHer Majesty had ever visited.He said: The Queen told me that she had been there and that it was lovely. I said I was on board for my knowledge of the Pacic and she said aposYou’ll be busy over there.apos I said we would because the regional navies would keep us on our toes.  Today’s engagement is the first in a series of high-profile in-person engagement the Queen will undertake in the coming weeks and is said to be enthusiastic toto in-person visits after the covid lockdown.The Queen first met Commodore Steve Moorhouse and Captain Angus Essenhigh in March  before the pandemic lockdown.Captain Angus Essenhigh, commanding officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth, said: It was absolutely thrilling. It’s always a great privilege to host the Queen because she has such great ties to our service.To have her both as our sovereign and as our sponsor for the ship to come and wish us well as we set off has been very special. I think she was taken aback by the scale of the endeavour that we’re setting out on and the people and the equipment we have on board now. The departure for HMS Queen Elizabeth is scheduled for .pm on Saturday, weather conditions permitting. It is the first operational deployment and comes after a long association with the monarch who named the ship in  and commissioned her in .After she leaves Portsmouth, the aircraft carrier will be joined by a fleet of warships including US and Dutch Navies all forming the Carrier Strike Group.The ship boasts a British and American squadron of the latest F fighter jets and will travel with USS The Sullivans and the Dutch ship Evertsen. Stops will include Oman, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.Defence secretary Ben Wallace has said the fleet will exercise its right to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea but insists the UK is not seeking confrontation with China.

She said: I held his hand from pm and talked to him about promises I would keep. At ., the nurses came to change his syringe drivers and they said he was ok. I looked at the clock and I [said] to him aposdarling, it is getting close to the time, itaposs  more minutes [until] I walked down the aisleapos. I reassured him how much I loved him and how much he meant to me.  I told him I will be an old crazy cat lady and how I have adopted three cats already. Then I told him how much I loved him again and I reassured him I would be ok. And then the time came: .pm. He had one big breath, at .pm another one. At .pm, the exact time, six years before, I walked down the aisle, he took his last breath and his colour changed. So I knew it was final. With his last breath he gave me his last reassurance to show the immense love he had for me, he had held on for this signicant day and time as he promised. It was his last promise and he kept it. Steven, was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma in October .  He had joined the Royal Air Force in  and completed a number of tours including in Iraq. He ed to his Northumberland home and to RAF Boulmer in , following his diagnosis. Rita said that her husband had survived for much longer than doctors had predicted he would, thanks to his strength, spirituality, love of le and love of his family. She said Steven was a beam of light. After Stevenaposs diagnosis, the couple were still able to make precious memories in his final months, including meals with family, walks on the Northumberland coast, and completing the DIY projects he loved. Rita said: He lit up the room with his welcoming smile, booming voice, infectious personality and sense of humour. You would instantly warm to him and he would quickly accept you as part of his wider family.  A very caring, strong and loyal family man, he loved T-shirts and had a fabulous range. Steven would go out of his way to try to help anyone, even through his cancer-fighting days. He always said, aposBehind every dark cloud the sun always shinesapos. His extreme positivity was infectious, even on the darkest of days. She added: His love shines through my everyday le, before and after his death. Steven will also be greatly missed by his family, including parents Alison and Ken Vout, who recalled crying with pride at the passing out ceremony at RAF Halton as he joined the airforce, and how happy his career made him. They said that in Rita he had found the love of his le and that they had never had to worry about him being alone since the pair met.  They said: Steven has been a number one son and we love him forever and [his loss] has left an enormous hole in our hearts. Sharing a tribute on behalf of herself, her husband Kevin, and Stevenaposs nieces and nephews, sister Melissa Barnard recalled how her brother had been caring and creative ever since he was young, and remembered the adventures they would go on as children. She added: Steven had a caring and gentle heart who always thinks of others, mixed with a wicked sense of humour that made his ‘Dad jokes’ legendary, even during the times he was challenged the most by his illness. He never let anything stand in his way of getting what he wanted in le, he was focussed and constantly determined - no more so than in holding on to le for his wedding anniversary. Steven wanted people to realise that we live every day despite any challenges and that every day is beautul. He loved to enjoy a drink or two with friends or family and we have lots of fun memories dancing singing and playing pool, which he was great at. Overall, myself and family will never stop missing him and he will be in our hearts forever. Stevenaposs RAF colleagues are also devastated by his death. Steven and Rita had always been valued members of the Royal Air Force family. Group Captain David Keighley, station commander at RAF Boulmer, said: I am deeply saddened by the news of Sergeant Vout’s passing after many months of illness.  His courageous battle against cancer has given hope and inspiration to countless others across the country. The thoughts of all of us here at RAF Boulmer, and across the wider RAF, are with his family, friends and colleagues at this dficult time. Rita hopes that Stevenaposs story will still continue to inspire people. During his illness, Steven had been determined to share his message of strength and positivity to others living with cancer. She said: Steven’s strength, grace and dignity shone through all his cancer battling journey. He would want you to know everything is possible, stay strong, stay true to yourself and never give up.Stevenaposs loved ones are raising money for St Oswaldaposs Hospice in his memory, and donations can be made here.His funeral will be held at St Bartholomew’s Church, Newbiggin by the Sea, on Friday, June  at .pm followed by a cremation at Blyth Crematorium at .pm. Guests at the service are limited due to Covid- restrictions, but people are invited to line the route from his home to the church, ahead of the ceremony to pay their respects.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnFuneralsCancer"},{"url":null,"title":"student loan system out control","story":"NewsStudent loan system out of control as graduates leave uni with £k to repayEXCLUSIVE: New figures acquired by the Sunday Mirror show .million students have debts totalling to £billion, showing the system is a runaway trainmirrorShareCommentsByJohn SiddleMatthew Davis:,  MAY NewsGrace Dean fears she will never repay her loan \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But interest as high as .% can plunge many into further debt – and % are not expected to clear the loan within  years, at which point it is wiped off.

Cars were set on fire in the middle of the road, missiles were thrown at police and crowds cheered as a vehicle was rolled down a steep hill in the Mayhill area of Swansea on Thursday night. Seven officers suffered scratches and bruises when they were pelted with missiles but did not require hospital treatment. A spokesperson for South Wales Police said those who have been arrested on suspicion of unlawful violence are local males aged , ,  and  and all four remain in custody. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror.  The arrests came after Jeremy Vaughan, Chief Constable of South Wales Police, said those responsible for the disorder would face “robust action” and the force would “stop at nothing” to bring them to justice. Officers said they were using CCTV and social media footage to identy those responsible and urged people to send in any photos or videos. The evening had started peacefully when a vigil was held for -year-old Ethan Powell who collapsed and died suddenly on Wednesday. Police are investigating the “trigger” that caused the night to turn ugly.  An eyewitness claimed about  people were at the disturbance. Officers warned people to stay indoors as the incident unfolded. First Minister Mark Drakeford had earlier condemned the “completely unacceptable” scenes and said the violence would “not be tolerated anywhere in Wales”. Home Secretary Priti Patel said previously: “Absolutely disgraceful scenes in Swansea last night. My thoughts are with Mayhill residents who had to endure such shocking behaviour.

Following the arrests, a police statement said on Saturday: There have been no further incidents of violence or disorder since Thursday night and increased patrols will continue over the weekend. Officers wish to thank those residents who have already come forward and provided witness statements and video footage. However, they are also appealing for more information. Detective Superintendent Gareth Morgan, who is leading the investigation, said that further arrests are expected. Detectives and unormed officers will be present and visible in the community over the coming days and weeks, he added. He said: There are many residents who were present at the scene during the disturbance and will no doubt know the identity of those who caused damage and threatened violence. I urge the public not to protect those who showed such disregard for the community of Mayhill and to give us the names of those who can be seen on social media footage. We have a dedicated team of detectives who are carrying out extensive enquiries to identy those involved and we are ready to act upon any information received. He added that those who want to hand themselves in can do so at Swansea Central Police Station.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnSouth Wales PoliceCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"trophy hunters flock sick website","story":"NewsTrophy hunters flock to sick website to book holiday to shoot vulnerable speciesEXCLUSIVE: Website BookYourHunt has up to , hunts available and prey includes zebras at a starting price of £ for a killing spree and Cape buffalos at £,mirrorShareCommentsByChris McLaughlin:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsHunters use sick website to book click and kill holidays – so they can shoot vulnerable species\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Their prey include zebras at a starting price of £ for a killing spree and Cape buffalos at £,.Almost all the animals on BookYourHunt are exempt from forthcoming UK legislation aimed at banning the import of hunting souvenirs such as skins, antlers and heads.The website has up to , hunts available for animals such as reindeer , striped hyenas , golden jackalsand the African civet cat . They are not considered sufficiently at risk of extinction to make the Government’s designated categories of species to be covered by the new law. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  But all are on a “red list” compiled by global animal rights body the International Union for the Conservation of Nature which considers them near threatened or vulnerable.Others on the hunt list include camels, kangaroos and even sheep.Eduardo Goncalves, founder of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, said: “This is a click-to-kill catalogue which sick psychos browse before choosing a defenceless animal to shoot for fun. “It’s a one-stop snuff shop for hunters who love to kill for thrills. There’s something for every animal murderer.”  Explorer Ranulph Fiennes said: “This is the most hideous website I have ever heard of. It’s advertising animals like you’re doing a weekly shop, except the photos show bloodthirsty psychopaths grinning moronically over the dead animals they’ve killed for fun. “Trophy imports like these should be banned, they’re an absolute disgrace.” MPs are signing a cross-party Commons motion to press ministers to include less endangered species in the new law – and jail time for offenders. Tory MP David Amess, who is behind the move, said: “We should ensure all animals are protected from those who take pleasure in killing them for entertainment and furnishings.

Labour environment spokesman Luke Pollard agreed: “If the ban only covers lions and elephants and doesn’t include zebras and other species it will simply displace the cruelty from one species to another.” Campaigners are trying to close another loophole that would allow hunters to import trophies of threatened animals like lions and elephants infor a “conservation exemption” fee. James Reed, north America director of BookYourHunt, condemned the proposed ban for “ignoring the scientically proven benefits trophy hunting provides to animal species”. Mr Reed, whose US firm has offices in Vienna, Budapest, Moscow and Sydney, said: “We strongly support ethical, legal conservation-based hunting”.  Mr Reed claimed that hunting deters human encroachment on animalhabitats and overgrazing by livestock which would “decimate” land.He said: “The loss in revenue from diminished hunting opportunities would increase poaching and cause anti-poaching efforts to cease due to lack of funding by trophy hunting. “On the surface it is easy to let emotions rule when in reality such bans lead to decreased wildle and habitat.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnSunday PeopleAnimalsTrophy Hunting"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather britain set scorching","story":"NewsUK weather: Britain set for scorching heatwave with C sunshine for weeks after washoutWhile May has been a washout, weather forecasters say the UK will see \"quite a contrast\" in June with temperatures soon expected to top CmirrorShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video uk-bask-heatwave--consecutive-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:DwsDRWIS,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

This month, though, could be one of the wettest Mays on record, surpassing , when .mm of rain fell across the UK.  Wales has seen almost double the average levels of rainfall for the entire month. The nation has recorded mm of rainfall so far, making this month already Walesapos fourth dampest May on record. Devon has also been hammered by .mm of rain, which is  per cent of the regionaposs mm May average. This makes it the eighth wettest May for the south-west pocket of the UK, against a record of .mm. Ms Shuttleworth added: We have seen a lot of rain in Devon and Wales over the past week. They have seen well above those average in those sorts of regions. But there is a good deal of uncertainty in the forecast, so weaposre hoping by the end of May we will have much drier and more settled weather across the UK. If this drier weather does come in, it looks like it will scupper any rainfall carrying on and accumulating as it has at this point in the month.  Today Many places starting dry with sunny spells, but a scattering of showers developing, before a band of rain, some heavy, and strong winds moves east across western and later central areas. This followed by heavy showers across Northern Ireland. Tonight Rain, some heavy, clearing east across England, but becoming slow moving across central and then northern Scotland. Clear spells developing, but heavy showers following across Wales and southwest England. Monday Cold, wet and windy across northern Scotland. Sunny spells and heavy showers where, frequent England and Wales with risk of hail and thunder. Driest for Northern Ireland and southern Scotland. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday Showers or longer spells of rain Tuesday and Wednesday for many areas. Western areas always drier, with these settled conditions developing more widely by Thursday. Temperatures recovering closer to normal.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMet OfficeBanksHeatwaveWeather"},{"url":null,"title":"woman transforms local spar stunning","story":"NewsWoman transforms her local Spar into stunning luxury seaside home on market for £kElizabeth Williams used to pop in for a loaf of bread to her local Spar in Newton, Porthcawl in Wales, but when it came on the property market she saw it in a whole new lightmirrorShareCommentsByJoanne RidoutKara ONeillReporter:,  MAY NewsWhat the property looked like when it was a Spar shop \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

When the shop in Newton, Porthcawl in Wales closed down and went on the market, for Elizabeth Williams, it suddenly became an opportunity to add to her property portfolio. But it would no longer be a convenience store where locals could pop in for a loaf of bread.Instead, it would become a stunning and luxurious home by the sea which is now on the market for almost £,, reports Wales Online.Elizabeth, who has renovated several properties over the years, says: When I saw it, I instantly knew we had to buy it.For many years, Iaposve had a fascination for old buildings, especially buildings with some history behind them and itaposs always a bonusit is located in a conservation area, as many of the original character and features remain. Do you have a similar story  Email webnews@mirror.  Four years ago we renovated a hayloft on Clevis Hill, just up the road from the Spar, so we already had a feel for the area. Initially I knew we could design something with a contemporary feel which would fit in with the character of the existing properties in the village, a place that includes a iety of designs. The Spar building, a single-storey commercial unit, didnapost look like anything special, but Elizabeth saw past the dated exterior. She says: It was totally derelict, with no amenities, very dark and dingy, extremely wet but I couldnapost wait to get started.  Friends and family thought we were mad, and couldnapost believe we were taking on another project involving a derelict building. Overall the residents in the local community were extremely pleased that the building was going to be restored from its derelict condition. Of course, before any of Elizabethaposs creative ideas could even begin to become a reality there were discussions with the local authorityaposs planning department to get change of use from commercial to residential and discuss the design of the proposed new home. Elizabeth, , and originally from Port Talbot, says: The process generally ran smoothly, there were certain challenges as the design had to meet a certain criteria set out by the planning department.  This involved, for example, adhering to certain design of bricks, tiles and colour of rendering which was in keeping with the local area. The overall process took approximately two months to conclude. But finally, building works could begin. As the Spar was attached to the property next door, there was work to do separating the drainage system between the two properties. Elizabeth says: Due to the close proximity of the neighbouring property a party wall agreement had to be put in place too which ensured certain stipulations were met which served everybodyaposs interests.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  However the main challenge then appeared in the form of Covid- and building had to stop. This delayed the project for a considerable amount of time as not only were our builders refrained from working there was also a dearth of building materials when they eventually resumed as the building suppliers had no stock. All in all, the works took seven months to complete. Elizabeth says: I wanted to create something with a coastal feel, being so close to Newton beach, so we discussed the matter with our architect Peter Lee and tasked him to design a property encompassing this. He came up with the boathouse design and thataposs how it evolved. Maybe the most pleasing aspect of the layout design is the way the reception rooms on the ground floor cluster around an inner courtyard that has created a tranquil and private outside space within the core of the site.  Thereaposs a spacious hall, room for a home office and plenty of storage. The property also boasts open-plan kitchen diner, with living room off it. Elizabeth comments:I wanted an open-plan design with a contemporary feel. The kitchen is of linear design and I feel it is the perfect fusion of ality and style. The units are lacquered high gloss in light grey, with integrated handles J-Pull style, and marble effect work surfaces and I think its sleek design sits seamlessly within the room. A ground floor bedroom also has bi-fold doors that lead out onto the garden terrace and an ensuite. Up the attractive American oak tread staircase, and the house has two further double bedrooms, both with an ensuite shower room. Added extra practical features include two off-road parking places and state-of-the-art sprinkler system installed inside. Elizabeth says: My favourite space is the open-plan kitchen overlooking the garden that oozes tranquillity, but maybe my favourite feature is the locality - being so close to the sea and situated in an area of so much history and character.  She adds: After purchasing the property we were reliably informed that the first ever owners of the store were known as Mr and Mrs Chard so, as we wanted to retain some of the history, we named it Chard House. Elizabeth has completed a number of property renovations now and has some tips for others thinking about their own projects. She says: Speak to as many people as possible who have been involved in property developing, get as many quotes from builders as possible and have continuous dialogue with the builder you choose. Always make sure there is a contingency budget in place, use all available resources to obtain the most competitive prices of materials, have nerves of steel and be prepared for the unexpected! Elizabeth says the local community has been very supportive of the project. She says: They seem very happy, as in recent years the area was becoming extremely busy with the shop attracting increased footfall and traffic, as well as delivery vehicles attending the premises at all hours of the day. With Chard House we feel we have helped transform our area of the village and enhanced the value of neighbouring properties, especially with its shape and iniduality - there is no other one like it. I feel extremely relieved and proud and canapost wait to do it all again - Iaposm already looking! Chard House is for sale for £, with Thompsons Estate Agents, Porthcawl.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnHousing"},{"url":null,"title":"napping jeffrey epstein guards admit","story":"NewsNapping Jeffrey Epstein guards admit lying about watching him on night he diedThe guards, who have been accused of browsing the internet when they should have been monitoring Epstein, have admitted falsying records but will skip jailmirrorShareByRory CassidyReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMichael Thomas and Tova Noel shopped for furniture and surfed the internet while they were supposed to be checking on Epsteins cell \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Michael Thomas and Tova Noel have agreed to a plea deal with US prosecutors meaning they will skip prison over convictions for falsying records relating to August . The pair were charged after apparently napping and browsing the internet instead of keeping an eye on the millionaire paedophile throughout their sht, Liverpool Echo reports. According to prosecutors, Thomas looked up sports news and motorcycle sales and Noel shopped online for furniture on the night. Under a deferred prosecution agreement disclosed late on Friday, Noel and Thomas admitted wilfully and knowingly filling in forms saying they conducted regular checks on Epsteinaposs cell.  The bargain, which requires a judgeaposs approval and could be confirmed next week, will see the pair carry out  hoursapos community service and serve six months of supervised release. They must also cooperate fully with the US Justice Departmentaposs probe into the convicted child abuseraposs death. Financier and registered sex offender Epstein, , was found hanging in his cell at the politan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan on August  . At the time of his death he was being held on remand accused of sex trafficking charges. Epsteinaposs death, which was ruled a suicide by New York Cityaposs top medical examiner, angered then-Attorney General William Barr, and prompted a management overhaul at the Manhattan jail.  Ben Sasse, a senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a vocal critic of the governmentaposs handling of the Epstein case, blasted the deal as a joke. In a statement, the Nebraskan Republican said: Epsteinaposs victims have been failed at every single turn. One hundred hours of community service is a joke - this isnapost traffic court. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epsteinaposs longtime associate, has also denied sex trafficking offences and charges that she procured underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwellaposs lawyers have complained that guards in the Brooklyn jail where she is being held on remand regularly shine flashlights into her cell during the night, ostensibly to ensure her safety. They have also said Maxwell, who is expected to go on trial in November, is not a suicide risk and wants her day in court.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnUnited States Department of JusticePrisonsCommunity serviceCrimePoliticsJeffrey Epstein"},{"url":null,"title":"homeowner leaves postman hilarious note","story":"NewsHomeowner leaves postman hilarious note about spider that is holding mail hostageA very amusing note left on a mailbox for a postman has gone viral on social media, in which a homeowner asks for help with a spider thats been holding the mail hostagemirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAY NewsThe postman got an amusing note\" %, rgba, rgba, url\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your dayInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

victory in the first leg of their Premiership play-off final against Kilmarnock.Playing in front of a home Dens crowd for the first time, club captain Charlie Adam scored what could be a crucial goal in the Dark Blues# quest for promotion.Fans were back inside the ground for the first time in over  months and liked what they saw as Jordan McGhee opened the scoring on six minutes.The home side struck early in the second half, too, as Adam stroked home Paul McMullan#s set-up to cue massive noise from the Bobby Cox Stand.However, Kilmarnock kept themselves within touching distance going into Monday#s second leg at Rugby Park as Brandon Haunstrup netted for - on  minutes.The big fitness concerns for the Dark Blues heading into the contest were the hamstrings of both Liam Fontaine and Jordan Marshall.Centre-back Fontaine made the starting XI, seeing Jordan McGhee move back into the midfield role he#s proved so deadly in. Max Anderson was the man to drop to the bench.Marshall, meanwhile, was only fit enough for a place on the bench after five weeks out. He was joined by striker Jason Cummings as a substitute with Danny Mullen leading the line.The dangermen started for the Premiership side with Chris Burke looking to provide service for striker Kyle Lafferty.A huge roar erupted from the  home fans as Dundee kicked off, shooting towards the empty Bob Shankly Stand in the first half.The rain was teaming down with a chill wind but there was no dampening of voices at the other end.They were up again seconds into the contest as Shaun Byrne crunched into Greg Kiltie in midfield.The real roar came on six minutes, though, as Dundee got off to the perfect start.And it was that man McGhee with another key play-off goal.Charlie Adam found time in the middle to chip perfectly over the defence for the run of Cammy Kerr.With his left-foot the full-back sent the ball in first time to find the head of Mullen.Colin Doyle got to it but could only push the ball onto the post. Following in was McGhee, however, and he got his reward with a tap-in on the line.And it could easily have been - inside  minutes as Paul McMullan found himself through on goal.He took his time but couldn#t beat Doyle from the angle.On the quarter-hour mark Killie threatened for the first time as Lafferty ran the channel in behind Fontaine before curling an effort well wide.As the conditions worsened, the visitors began to work the ball and work the Dundee defence.They weren#t getting much change out of the Dark Blues players charged up by the boisterous  in the stand, though.The contest meandered towards half-time with neither side able to create much on the slippy pitch and howling wind.Kilmarnock boss Tommy Wright wasn#t happy with his side#s performance, either, giving the dugout a good whack and his players an earful.Four minutes before the break Dundee did create a look at goal and, once more, McGhee was the man.Mullen did well to get down the left flank before cutting back for the midfielder. McGhee#s effort, though, was deflected into the side-netting.A quick start to the first half was followed by a fast start to the second.Dundee shooting towards the home fans, the script was written for only one man.Harassing play from Christie Elliott saw McMullan pinch the ball off Gary Dicker and cut the ball back.Playing in front of a home crowd for the first time, lelong Dee Adam was on hand to fire the Dark Blues - ahead.And his celebration in front of the cheering fans showed just how much that meant.After  months away it wouldn#t take much to get the Dundee fans behind their team.Their team, though, was responding to every shout, every bit of encouragement from the -strong support.On  minutes it was almost - as Killie let possession slip once more, allowing Mullen to run into the area.His effort was well-struck but Doyle was equal to it with a good stop.With  minutes remaining, Killie got their leline.There was an element of luck about it as a combination of Mullen and Kerr blocked Haunstrup#s first effort.The ball, though, dropped perfectly for the full-back to slot through the legs of Adam Legzdins.And it was almost level just moments later as Legzdins had to be sharp to beat the ball out at his front post.The nerves were obvious from the support every time Kilmarnock ventured forward in the closing stages.There was still plenty going the other way, too, but there would be no more scoring.That leaves Dundee just one game away from promotion back to the top flight, heading to Rugby Park on Monday with a -

Fontaine and Marshall have been training and we’ve no new concerns from last Thursday. We’ve almost a full squad.“I was holding Fontaine back. Marsh, kind of, but it was more trying to control his workload more without risking him in a game.“We wanted to get the high speed running into him because that’s what his game is about.“That’s where his injuries usually come from, so we tried to do that in a controlled way.“We had a - cushion and were confident going into the game. We weren’t going to risk Fontaine because we knew we’d have him back for Thursday’s game.“It’s great to have a full squad to choose from. Jack Hamilton and Fin Robertson are the two senior ones who are missing at the minute but apart from that, everyone is healthy and can play and be on the pitch.”The Dark Blues head into the double-header in good heart after an impressive run of form saw them finish second on the final day of the Championship.Though defeat to Raith last time out ended their nine-match unbeaten streak, the confidence built up won’t be dulled.And McPake says the experience scattered throughout his squad will ensure that is the case.He added: “It’s a boost for our team any time they turn round and look at each other.“Paul McGowan scored a penalty in front of , people at Hampden, a full house, in a semi-final against Celtic.“Shaun Byrne’s won in the playoffs with Livingston. Jason Cummings and Liam Fontaine played in the cup final when Hibs hadn’t won the cup.“I’ve been at Hibs and I know how important that game was for them.“Charlie Adam is an exceptional talent and an exceptional player. He’s got real, real experience of high pressure games.“When you look about our squad, and you see the names of the players in there, then you’re glad they’re standing beside you.#Dundee wow fans with #Fabric of the City# new kit launch ahead of Kilmarnock promotion showdown\" title\"#Dundee wow fans with #Fabric of the City# new kit launch ahead of Kilmarnock promotion showdown# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-wow-fans-with-fabric-of-the-city-new-kit-launch-ahead-of-kilmarnock-promotion-showdown embed # secretmuWVH\" data-secret\"muWVH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/13463732-1-535x372.jpg ","title":"former dundee united and raith rovers coach laurie ellis succeeds ray mckinnon as queens park manager","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remLaurie Ellis has landed his first role in management, succeeding his former Dundee United and Raith Rovers colleague Ray McKinnon as Queen#s Park manager.Ellis, , was previously assistant boss with the Spiders, helping them to League  glory this season, but steps up to the top job following McKinnon#s shock exit earlier this month.The duo have previously enjoyed a close working relationship, with Ellis initially playing under McKinnon at Stark#s Park before joining his backroom staff.

There’s nowhere near the same engagement as actually being there.“I can’t wait.”Ross has been hard at work over the past year or so setting up the  Foundation for fans to help support the club.For Saturday#s play-off second leg against Raith Rovers, with fans still unable to attend due to coronavirus restrictions, the Foundation sold virtual tickets.The aim was to ‘sell out’ the almost ,-capacity ground with proceeds going directly to the club.• Virtual ticket raised just under k• Now over  members • Over £, a month donated to @DundeeFC from the fans• On course to top £, in their first yearJoin here 👇🏻https:t.co yTAtevSEbmdash The Dee ArchiveMay , He admits that was a tall order but he’s delighted with the money raised to top up their overall tally to more than £, for the past season.“We were just shy of , tickets sold which is around about what we managed the last time,” he added.“Ideally we wanted a sell-out but we’re happy with the end result.“We raised about £, from the game on Saturday and that brings us to around £, for the entire season.“That’s phenomenal really in our first year.“We have around  members now and we hope to see some  Foundation scarves on show for the first time tonight!”The big question, though, is how the match might pan out tonight at Dens Park.Kilmarnock are the big favourites, being the Premiership team, but Dundee have been in good form of late.Ross said: “I’ll take a draw. Going to Rugby Park for a one-off game might suit us.“With these games you go in with more hope than expectation, to be honest.”mdash Dundee Football ClubMay , Russell, meanwhile, has a similar view: “We’ve been playing well and we’ve got goals in us but I’m not bullish.“I think we’ll score but the main thing is the tie is still alive for the second leg.”And Sean adds: “I think it’s all about the first leg,we can go to Kilmarnock on Monday night with either a draw or a win we give ourselves a great chance.“It won’t be easy keeping Kyle Lafferty quiet but we have good players in our team as well, let’s hope the fans can get right behind them and cheer them on to win.“It would mean so much to the club and fans.“With there being no fans in this year the relationship has gotten closer with the club and the fans setting up the  foundation and things like that.“I feel there’s a buzz around the place.”EXCLUSIVE: Dundee stalwart Paul McGowan opens up on making  appearances # #I#ve loved every minute of being a Dundee player but winning promotion would top the lot#\" title\"#EXCLUSIVE: Dundee stalwart Paul McGowan opens up on making  appearances # #I#ve loved every minute of being a Dundee player but winning promotion would top the lot## # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  exclusive-dundee-stalwart-paul-mcgowan-opens-up-on-making--appearances-ive-loved-every-minute-of-being-a-dundee-player-but-winning-promotion-would-top-the-lot embed # secretGdqzlXOIh\" data-secret\"GdqzlXOIh\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-milton-couples-love-lasted-lifetime","story":"A PICTURE paints a thousand words, the old saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

It is taking over the site of the former Carphone Warehouse and Maplin stores.It will join KFC on the site, which initially caused some traffic concerns when the plans were originally lodged.Plans had initially been lodged by the Mexican food proprietor back in  and subsequently approved by council bosses last year.It is the th for the chain, and as a special promotion offering customers who download the app will be given a free taco and enjoy a special £ offer on Tuesdays.Head of marketing Lucy Dee said: #We’re delighted to be able to bring the drive-thru to Aberdeen.#Aberdeen has been crying out for more Taco Bells and we’re very pleased to be able to deliver creating local jobs despite challenging circumstances.#Now with eight Scotland locations under their belt, The Adil Group has no plans for slowing down and will be adding more sites before the year#s end.Chief executive Raja Adil added: #I am absolutely delighted to land another location in Scotland and with the success of our current Aberdeen store in Union Street it’s exciting to be able to now bring the drive thru  as well as more home delivery and exciting options to more areas in Aberdeen.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/ef-Fountain-07-Mono1.jpg_12359493-e1621514844575-620x372.jpg ","title":"ornate granite fountain set to be rejuvenated to mark 150th anniversary of aberdeen park","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWork to restore an ornate granite fountain, which was run dry and missing pieces for years, could soon be under way.The historic fount in Victoria Park was gted to the citizens of Aberdeen by the Granite Polishers And Master BuildersBut it has fallen into such disrepair it has been placed on the Buildings At Risk Register.Volunteers working under the Friends Of Victoria And Westburn Park think it will cost around £, to make the octagonal fountain # B-listed for its Greek Revival mots # work once again.The ornamental water feature consists of  types of granite, including from nearby Rubislaw, Corrennie, Kemnay and Peterhead.And chairman of the friends of the park body, community councillor Peter Stephen, says a near £, grant from Aberdeen#s Common Good Fund should take their fundraising efforts over the line.However, work remains ongoing to have all the funding they have been promised, from multiple sources, signed off.Repair bills for the one-time Rosemount favourite were revised in , having previously been estimated at £,.Mr Stephen said: #The fountain a fabulous landmark and this project is something we have been looking forward to getting on with for years – since the formation of the group seven years ago.“One of our biggest trials has been finding funding to get it back in working order.“It’s one of the most beautul fountains we have in Aberdeen and for it to lie neglected and unused for as many years as it has is shame.#We are now at the point of signing for money for the fountain, that#s an ongoing process.#It#s looking good for the futurewe can get all these bits of paper signed, the Ts crossed and Is dotted, we will get this fountain up and running.#It is the th year of the park, so it would be grand to do it this year.#The park was acquired by the city authority in  and the fountain, designed seven years later by Aberdeen architect John Bridgeford Pirie, was nearly placed where in Union Terrace Gardens.Pirie was also the draughtsman behind many of the ornate granite buildings around his home in the city#s Hamilton Place # and the Victoria Park water feature, one of his earlier works, features many themes # such as stylised Greek flowers, anthemion and paterae bowls # also found in their designs.He was also responsible for the Gothic churches at Queen#s Cross in Aberdeen and Fraserburgh South.So far, the friends of the park volunteers have collected just shy of £, and fundraising remains ongoing.But the sum is enough to dismantle the granite landmark, with a view to re-piping its innards and replacing the electrics.A number of granite bowls, which sit atop the lowest of four tiers, have gone missing as it fell into disrepair.Mr Stephen added: #The money we have will pay for the refurbishment and rejuvenation of the fountain.#The basin it sits in will also need to be made watertight as it one of the problems, leading to it being switched off and never turned back on, was that it leaked a bit.#However, he said, further donations were needed to pay to replace spalling on the concrete work.Register For Scotland inspectors, after assessing the state of the tired monument in March , said: #External inspection found it disused and showing some signs of deterioration.#There is some missing mortar with cracking and minimal chipping of masonry.#It is in overall fair condition but should be moved to the At Risk Register.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/vaccine-rollout-140521-e1621007541735-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board.The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

There is usually a palpable tension in the air.But there was none of that at this count. Carried out in a dferent way during daytime, physically spread out, limited attendees, socially distanced and cordoned off behind plastic.Everyone behind the planning of the election in Argyll and Bute deserves a huge pat on the back.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left. After m, turn left at a fork in the track into the woodland .The track meets the other route just ahead. Veering left your path climbs noticeably over the next .km, through plantations, past the reservoir off to the right # worth a small detour # until arriving at a junction.The Kintyre Way continues north whereas your path heads sharply left to continue up the hill.The next section opens out and is a lovely part of the walk, with excellent views back to Arran.After a few minutes, and as the path heads south on the higher section, look for the path to the summit on your right.It is now a very short hop to the summit Trig pointfor some lovely views right down Kintyre and towards Ailsa Craig.Although known as Deer Hill, Cnoc an Ghabar translates as Goat Hill I suspect there will be an explanation!Return to the path, meandering southwards for .km, with the odd little up and plenty of steep downs, passing back into the woodland where it meets another track.Turn left and look out for the path right just over m ahead. Follow this down through the dark woods.After m look for the path and steps heading right.

You can now enjoy the vast open expanse of sand as you head eastwards across the lovely Carradale Bay.When you reach the far end of the bay, over km away, veer right to a gate by a ruin.Passing through the gate a small path now meanders up through gorse and bracken heading south towards Carradale Point.It is worth keeping to the higher ground on the way out as the path drops down through interesting rocks near its end with some grand views.This is also a great vantage point from which to see the area’s feral goats,about.At the end you can cross to the vitried fort on the islet unless there are very high spring tides.To , take the lower path* up the western side just above the shoreline # a mass of wildflowers in early summer. This also allows closer inspection of the amazing folded Dalradian rocks.Once back at the bay # where you may decide a swim is in order # head right up the track from the carpark at its eastern end.After a gate you will be in fields which may have livestock. Veer sharp left at the other side of the first field and follow the track to another gate out on to a lane.Head straight ahead toto Carradale village and the main road. Right will take you back down to the harbour and past potential refreshments.*You can also follow part of the coast or go over the top to Port Righand along the edge of the golf course via Airds Castle ruins before dropping back down to Carradale harbour.

With their strong Gaelic and Norse heritage they defied the will of kings, and their political influence was undeniable.This independence of spirit might account, in part at least, for a modern-day habit of Islay folk # to enter the world of politics.With the election earlier this month of Jenni Minto as constituency MSP, the island now has three serving Argyll and Bute politicians, with council leader Councillor Robin Currie and Councillor Alastair Redman.Orkney and Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael, another Ileach, can be added to the list # and there may be more out there.Then there is George Robertson # now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen # former Labour politician and Secretary General of NATO, and the much-respected late Labour leader John Smith, both of whom have Islay connections.All of the above from an island of little more than , people.The Argyllshire Advertiser decided to ask the politicians themselves for their theories about why Islay has the habit of producing a preponderance of politicians.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Robin Currie explained: #Ileachs are known for their sense of community, their enthusiasm for their island and their culture, and their erse mix of skills and resilience # so it#s no surprise that so many of us want to take that a stage further by representing not only our own island but the whole of Argyll and Bute, or indeed the country itself, as is the case with George Robertson and the late John Smith.#All of these characteristics will stand anyone in good stead when it comes to le as an elected representative, whether that’s at local or national government level.#It#s great that [in Argyll and Bute] we have a good balance of elected representatives of all political flavours, who understand the needs and characteristics of that mix of communities, and who can bring that knowledge together to work on issues of strategic as well as local importance.#Councillor Currie added: #It goes without saying that I wish my fellow Ileach, Jenni Minto, every success in her new role and I look forward to working with her.#Conservative Alastair Redman # one of three councillors serving Kintyre and the Isles alongside Councillor Currieand Tarbert#s Anne Horn# pointed to Islay#s #unique economy and location# as part of the reason for its political prominence.#Islay is both rural and at the same time heavily industrialised with our large number of distilleries,# he said.#It might be considered isolated yet is a global trading powerhouse. We on Islay have a population of just a few thousand yet our name is world famous.#There is also our history which to a degree separates us from mainland Scotland. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald with roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland, beginning with Somerled in the th century.#I feel that this has led to Ileachs being more independent and perhaps at times more forthright than others.#I hope that many more councillors, MSPs, MPs, cabinet ministers, lords and even prime ministers will come from my home island which, though small, has made a huge mark on this world.#The last word goes to the newest member of Islay#s political gang, Jenni Minto MSP.The SNP member also cited the island#s past influence on Scottish politics through Finlaggan and the Lordship of the Isles.And she highlighted more examples of single-minded Ileachs making their mark on the world.#In - three ships with Islay people on board sailed for the New York colony,# said Ms Minto.#On one of these was five-year-old Alexander McDougall, who became a key figure in America’s war for independence. He had a very successful le, rising to the rank of Major General in the continental army. He then entered public service and was elected to the New York state senate. On his death he was described by George Washington as one of the five pillars of the American revolution.##I am not Islay-born,# she continued, #but feel very lucky to live on such a wonderful island. I often describe it as the centre of the universe, and there are very few places you can visit without meeting someone from Islay or someone who has a connection with the island.#I think that coming from, or living on, an island you need a level of resilience and creativity but you also have a true sense of community and working together.#Islay is also known to be a friendly place, where everyone has time to chat and listen to other people’s thoughts and views.#I think all of these traits are needed in politics and so perhaps it is not a surprise that Islay people have entered public service.#PICS:Jenni Minto MSP. no_aScotElection_McglynnArgyll and Bute Council leader, Robin Currie. aelectionCurrienoCouncillor Alastair Redman.

Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth.

Do not touch the fabric tipof the swab.Open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip over both tonsils . Do this  times on each side. Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds. Itrsquos important to mix thoroughly.Pinch the tube as you remove the swab and put the nozzle cap on.Squeeze the extraction tube to place two drops of fluid on the test strip. Watch out for any air bubbles.Set a timer for  minutes and leave the test strip on a clean, flat surface.Once your test is complete, place all used test kit contents in the waste bag provided and put this in your bin.Where testing takes place - community testing sitesIfyou do not have coronavirus symptoms but live in a community that has been targeted for testing, you can access a test at a rapid test site.These are only available in some parts of Scotland.You can usually just turn up and do not need to book in advance ndash but you should check the arrangements at your local site first.You will be tested using a lateral flow devicewhich involves taking a swab or saliva sample.You should usually get your result within an hour.Island testingThe First Minister also added that people visiting the islands should take two lateral flow tests before travelling.Nicola Sturgeon said: \"We are keeping island communities at the same level as the rest of the country at the moment, so that we can allow travel between island communities and the rest of Scotland.\"But we know this does create a risk for our island communities.\"Many of them currently have very, very low rates of Covid.\"And they will be welcoming visitors from parts of Scotland which I know many of them are looking forward to where Covid will still be circulating at a higher level and more widely.\"So If you are planning to travel to an island we do encourage you to take two lateral flow tests before you depart.\"The second test should be on the day that you are planning to travel, and the first should be three days before you travel.\"That means thatyou test positive, you have a chance to take a PCR test - which is more sensitive - to confirm the result before making a final decision on cancelling your visit.\"This is potentially an important way in which we can minimise the risk, of bringing Covid into island communities while nevertheless allowing our island communities the benefit of opening up again to visitors.\"Soyou are planning on travelling to an island over the course of next week, it is possible to get tests from today, and I would encourage you to do that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"times-league-table-borders-high-schools-appear-top-50","story":"A LEAGUE table of Scottish secondary schools has been published by The Timesndash and the Borders has two in the top .The newspaper creates rankings every year based on the proportion of pupils achieving five or more Highers.This years editionwas published in print on Wednesday, May , showing a total of  schools in the country.GalashielsAcademy has risen by more than  places compared with last years chart.The Elm Row school is now in th place ndash up from last yearrsquos finish of th, as reported in the print edition of The Times.: Talented executive director is leaving Scottish Borders Council for new jobAccording to the latest statistics,  per cent of Gala Academy pupils achieved five or more Highers in .That is up on , which saw  per cent of Gala pupils complete the feat.In this yearrsquos table, only Earlston High Schooland Peebles High Schoolfinished above Gala Academy among the high schools in the Borders.Sixty-seven per cent of pupils at Earlston managed five or more Highers in , an increase of  per cent on rsquos figure .Meanwhile,  per cent of Peebles High pupils achieved five or more Highers last year, up from  per cent in .: Historic mansion near Borders saved from demolition following outcry over plansThe other Borders schools named in the rankings were Jedburgh Grammar School , Selkirk High School , Berwickshire High School , Kelso High School , Eyemouth High Schooland Hawick High School .As a region, the Borders council area was th in a league table of Scottish councils after . per cent of pupils graduated with five or more Highers.That is a . per cent increase on rsquos figure .A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \"There is a lot of good work going on right across the nine high schools in the Borders and it should be noted that there are a number of dferent ways of measuring the health and success of a school.\"The top performing school in the latest table based on this metric was Jordanhill School, Glasgow, which recorded an  per cent success rate of pupils recording five or more Highers.The lowest performing school was Craigroyston Community High School, Edinburgh, which recorded nine per cent of pupils achieving the feat."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-vaccine-passport-scheme-announced-scotland","story":"A new scheme that will allow Scots to prove they have been vaccinated against coronavirus before travelling abroad has been launched by the Scottish Government.Those who have been vaccinated can download a letter from the NHS Inform patient website, or request a letter from the Covid Status Helplinethey are not online.But as details of the vaccination status scheme were announced, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith urged people to be \"highly cautious about international travel\"and ldquocontinue to limit their travel abroad.Only those travelling to a country where proof of vaccination is needed as an entry requirement should request a letter.There are currently no countries that require travellers to show their vaccination status, but the letter scheme is being introduced because international travel requirements can change quickly during the pandemic.What to do before going abroad:If yoursquore planning to travel abroad, you must:check whether a country yoursquore travelling to is on the red, amber or green listconfirm what you need to do when you arrive back in ScotlandCountries may move between the green, amber and red lists at short notice.You should not assume that a country on the green, amber or red list now will remain on the same list over the weeks and months ahead.Before you travelYoull also need to:have taken a coronavirus testin the threedays before you begin your journey to Scotland -

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp. The past year has been very dficult for everyone, so let#s show the heroes of the pandemic just how much we appreciate what they have done for us.Full details can be found at www.royalmail stampcompetitionAs a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties in the Scottish Parliament election to tackling the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.The commitment by the political parties to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, is therefore to be appreciated and must be a priority for the next parliament.Our children are remarkably resilient, but the frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many of them presents a compelling case for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This mental health crisis is one we can address, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that which was demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures – and themselves.The British Hedgehog Preservation Society is asking people create their very own haven for the UK#s only spiny mammal this Hedgehog Awareness Week, from May -.Gardens are a stronghold for hedgehogs, and we can make their lives so much easier with very little effort.Tips will be given out on our social media accounts during the week using #hedgehogweek with daily competitions to win hedgehoggy prizes.There are many things we can all do to help hedgehogs.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

I am grateful to the Courier reviewer and to the other reviewers in the BBC, ITV and papers from Stornoway to London for giving it such a good start.#My advice to young authors  Stick at it. The first  books are the worst!#His latest book for children, Super Nova and the Frozen Man, is also doing well in hard cover and paperback. Most of Angus#s books are published in European countries, and some in America, but only the other day he heard this one is being published in Japan.#I#d rather have heard that my golf handicap is coming down, but that would be even more of a miracle.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOPlease noteThe change in the publishing day of the Courier to Thursday of each week instead of Friday has proved so acceptable to readers, particularly to the large number resident outside the district, that we have resolved to make the arrangement a permanent one.Sparks and flashesA meeting will be held in the Town Hall on Friday evening with the object of forming a branch of An Comunn Gàidhealach in Campbeltown.Neil M#Bain is among the latest of the Ayr United Football Club players to fix up for another season.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May .

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"budding young photographers make their mark","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Known only to the world mysteriously as #Pat#, he decided to part with his , bottle library last year, through a series of auctions, with a mission to share his passion for whisky with the world by passing his bottles on to new owners.Joe Wilson, head of auction content at Whisky Auctioneer, said: #Fèis Ìle is an iconic celebration of whisky and Islay culture that draws people back to the island year after year.#From Port Ellen to Bowmore and Bruichladdich to Ardbeg, this collection of Fèis Ìle bottlings is without a doubt the largest and most complete we have ever encountered.#The auction presents the rare opportunity for collectors and whisky drinkers to acquire some incredibly scarce malts that have been produced to celebrate the history of this iconic whisky region.#Examples from each of Islay#s eight single-malt producing distilleries feature in the sale, including complete collections of every single limited edition festival bottling from distilleries including Bowmore, Laphroaig and Lagavulin.The sale also features bottles that have been donated to the Fèis Ìle committee by distilleries to raise charitable funds for the island through their Islay Wave Project, which will focus on ways to support culture, artists and youth.Included in the charity lots is the oldest and rarest release directly from the iconic Islay distillery, Port Ellen. The Port Ellen -year-old # Rogue Casks# is the second release in the #Untold Stories# series, which explores the intriguing history of the Islay distillery ahead of its re-opening after closure almost three decades ago.Florence Grey, chairperson of the Fèis Ìle committee, said: #Fèis Ìle was delighted to be given the bottles in this charity auction from Diageo, plus a signed bottle from the legendary Islay whisky maker Jim McEwan.#All the proceeds raised from these bottles will benefit our island community as the funds will kickstart our Islay Wave Project # an ongoing project that will begin after this year#s virtual festival.#Focusing on ways to support our island#s culture, artists and youth, The Islay Wave Project concentrates on everything we celebrate throughout Fèis Ìle.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

During it, Mr OrsquoConnor asks Professor Dawkinshe stands by advice he once offered to a woman who was unsure of the correct course of action in the event of being pregnant with a Downrsquos syndrome baby. The professor had told her: ldquoAbort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the worldyou have a choice.Mr OrsquoConnor declares his interest in this debate from the outset. He has a daughter with Downrsquos syndrome but he maintains a high level of professional detachment throughout the interview and conducts it in a spirit of polite inquiry. What follows from Professor Dawkins is perhaps the bleakest evaluation of humanity yoursquore likely to hear in a modern setting. What adds to the chill factor, I think, is that it also prescribes an inevitable direction of travel when the state presumes to legislate on matters surrounding end-of-le care.: English Tory triumph means that independence is our last refuge, by Kevin McKennaThe professor partially retreats from his original opinion by withdrawing the term lsquoimmoralrsquo. He suggests rather that it would be ldquowise and sensible in such circumstances to opt for an abortion. His justication for this is his assertion that ldquothe amount of suffering in the world probably does not go down ndash probably goes up ndash compared to having another child who doesnrsquot have Downrsquos syndrome. Professor Dawkins, a biologist who appeals to scientic fact during his regular trolling of people who profess religious faith, admits his view about what constitutes lsquosufferingrsquo is evidence-free. ldquoIt seems to me to be plausible I have no direct evidence, he tells the interviewer when pressed.Wersquoll leave aside the issue of how much an affluent white man residing in a rich country can ever fully grasp the concept of human suffering and its effects. These happy accidents of birth and the advantages they have bestowed on Mr Dawkins means he will always be inoculated from the suffering of multitudes of other humans less favoured. As a gted biologist the professor has used his advantages well in advancing our understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit. Inexplicably though, the knowledge he has gathered about the beautul ersity of creation seems not to have increased his compassion for it, but soiled it. What he is professing amounts to eugenics: the belief that only the fittest or best-equipped among us deserve to experience quality in our lives.Here, I must declare my own interest in this issue: I have a niece with Downrsquos syndrome. Itrsquos impossible to convey in a column such as this how much hurt she would feel, knowing that another human being harboured thoughts such as these how reduced how unloved how devalued. Ciara is a young woman now and, having known only the love of a large extended family, is embarking on a journey into adulthood and a future that holds the promise of good things.She has already represented her country in ious sports and, thanks to the skills, dedication and compassion of her primary school teachersshe is living a full le. She is also contributing to the happiness of others, this being a basic requirement for peaceful co-existence on earth. Professor Dawkins in his cruel, arrogant ignorance believes she and millions of others with Downrsquos syndrome are incapable of such. And lacking any evidence he chooses to see only that which he regards as other and abnormal and that these must be feared ndash and thus destroyed. It is the philosophy of Salem.Richard DawkinsYou hesitate to sign an entreaty that might adversely affect anotherrsquos ability to earn their keep. The Donrsquot Screen Us Out petition though, leaves room for Professor Dawkins to reconsider his views and their consequences for humanitythey ever entered the mainstream. It says this: ldquoPenguin Random House publishes Richard Dawkinsrsquo books. As a company, they make it clear that they ldquocelebrate and actively promote ersity and inclusion in all its forms, including and not limited to the nine protected characteristics cited in The Equality Act  including ldquodisability. They go on to say that ldquoIt is not acceptable to make dismissive or hostile remarks about a person on any basis or to make assumptions about someonersquos lestyle, interests or abilities.You may be tempted to dismiss criticism of the professor on the basis that, as a high-profile atheist they are consistent with a view that there is no ultimate force for good and that we must simply let the dice roll as they please. lsquoMoralityrsquo being merely existential, this is a grand space to inhabit in which you can set your own boundaries on what you consider to be lsquogoodrsquo. It conveniently frees us from any moral obligation to make the world lsquobetterrsquo.:Downs children like my beautul niece Ciara are a gt ndash not a burdenYet, itrsquos not on the basis of uncertain and precarious religious faith that we must disdain Professor Dawkinsrsquo barren evaluation of humanity. None of us was born complete. We will never be the finished article. At some point in our lives we will require to be fixed and restored. On these occasions the healing can only be provided by others and rests on their willingness to give something of themselves while asking nothing in .For many, the brokenness is long-lasting or permanent and may never be healed. This will call for an extraordinary measure of unconditional devotion that resists the urge to calculate cost or predict benefits. Itrsquos perhaps the most perfect love of all, but itrsquos one which we all have the capacity to offer. Richard Dawkins possesses it too and Irsquom sad that he under-estimates his own ability to reach it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Opposition, scrutiny and challenge should play a part in that, but in a constructive spirit.If the Governmentrsquos charge is to improve the nationrsquos position and prospects, opposition politicians, the press and the electorate ought to support measures toward that end, rather than reflexively objecting. But they need not be shy of advancing ideas for improvement or refinement of policy.This has never been more important. During the pandemic, much of the knee-jerk partisan position-taking of which governments and opposition parties are frequently guilty was set aside, as politicians grasped the urgent realities of the crisis.Despite the numerous criticisms that could be, and were, made of governmentsrsquo actions or other partiesrsquo positions, a remarkable degree of consensus was achieved, both within parliaments, and among the parliaments of the UK. Such an approach, a clear necessity in the emergency, ought also to be the aim in constructing recovery from it.Whatever the previous errors and mis-steps, Scotland and the UK as a whole are emerging strongly, with a very successful vaccine programme. Almost certainly as a result of that, the UK currently has by far the lowest number of cases of any European country. Vigilance against new iants and maintaining a cautious, common-sense approach remain important, but that position indicates that governments can turn to long-term policy in other areas, many of them seriously damaged during the pandemic and vital to recovery.Health and social care ndash which, after the misjudgments around care homes, it is obvious should be tackled together ndash remain a top priority as weto routine treatment for other diseases, face-to-face GPsrsquo surgeries, and the huge backlog that has inevitably been created. Urgently catching up with patients with other conditions will require funding, of course, but that cannot be the whole answer, or costs will simply spiral ever upwards. Imaginative, pragmatic and dogma-free approaches will be required.Education, badly interrupted for so many, despite schoolsrsquo and universitiesrsquo best efforts, will be another area crucial to recovery. A modern economy relies on an educated workforce, and industry on skills and training. The Governmentrsquos policies to this point have, at the very least, failed to meet its own expectations. Rather than criticisms being greeted with instinctive denials and affront, now is the time to rethink and work to restore Scotlandrsquos previously admirable reputation for equitable, high-quality education provision.One piece of good news is that the UK economy has proven more robust than expected, but Scotlandrsquos spending still outstrips its counterparts where in the UK, and signicant growth and understanding of businessrsquos needs is essential. Transport connectivity will play a huge role in that: devolved rail must match and work with changes being introduced where, the dreadful ferriesrsquo fiasco must be sorted, and the state of the roads urgently addressed.Some of this is the work of local government, which should have the proper resources to tackle potholes, housing, welfare and other fundamental services and amenities. That should involve more freedom from Holyrood, but with that comes responsibility. Taxpayers, at every level, fund such nuts-and-bolts issues, and have a right to expect accountability, decent services, value for money, and aon investment. It is our money, not the Governmentrsquos, and must be more effectively deployed.We should approach these issues forcefully, and positively. Whatever your own politics, this Government has strong popular support, an experienced team, and a capable First Minister.

No-one is actually harmed by this proto-censorship, apart from the students depriving themselves of the opportunity to learn. But things have taken a truly sinister turn in recent weeks.The lives of students like Lisa Keogh at Abertay, and lecturers like Dr Neil Thin at Edinburgh, are being destroyed by crack-handed inquisitions applying Monty Python concepts of justice. Lisa Keoghrsquos advocate, Joanna Cherry MP, has rightly condemned Abertayrsquos violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.Highly-paid university principals should now be held to account for failing to defend free speech. Ms Keoghrsquos only crime was to express a wholly-respectable opinion in a debate. She insisted that ldquowomen have vaginas ndash an observation that is only a heresy to advocates of non-binary dogma.Dr Neil Thin was suspended from his role as a senior lecturer in anthropology for criticising the risible decision by Edinburgh University last year to ldquocancel Scotlandrsquos greatest philosopher by striking his name from the David Hume Tower. This for a footnote to an article in  that was disparaging about non-white races.Dr Thin was echoing the views of Scotlandrsquos leading historian, Sir Tom Devine. As former Rector of Edinburgh University I also expressed my dismay at this stupefying act of intellectual philistinism, which has made Edinburgh University an international joke. They had been intending to rename it ldquoJulius Nyerere Tower until someone pointed out that the late president of Tanzania was a homophobe as well as a dictator.I pointed out that its new official name, ldquo George Square, celebrates King George , an ardent imperialist who was responsible for an unprecedented expansion of British colonialism. But they didnrsquot get it.Many academics were horried at the Hume Tower affair, but they kept silent, terried of culture warrior retribution. Dr Thin also had the temerity to question whether a campus event called ldquoResisting Whiteness, which involved people of colour only, didnrsquot look just a bit like ldquosegregation. This elicited howls of protest at his ldquoracism.Any self-respecting institution of higher learning would dismiss such accusations as ridiculous. But principal Peter Mathieson suspended Dr Thin, following claims by students that his remarks were ldquoproblematic and ldquooffensive.What he should have done was censure the students who had called Dr Thin a racist, when he is clearly nothing of the sort. I have looked at the social media comments made by Dr Thin, and none of them could be regarded by any reasonable person as expressing racism. He said what any open-minded person would say about an event which was quite literally segregated on the basis of race. His support for Sir Tom Devine is what every self-respecting academic should have done.I donrsquot particularly blame the students of BlackED for mounting a daft, attention-seeking campaign. Thatrsquos what students do. But I do blame the university authorities for responding to it and validating what was in reality a campaign of intimidation and abuse against a member of staff. These extreme anti-colonialist and non-binary dogmas are usually referred to as ldquowoke, but they would be more accurately described as the sleep of reason. Universities are supposed to challenge dogmas and subject political ideas to rigorous criticism. Yet the university authorities seem to be falling over themselves to encourage these infant Robespierres with their empty slogans andpseudo-scientic jargon.Over at Abertay University, principal Nigel Seaton last week defended his decision to conduct a disciplinary investigation into -year-old-mature law student Lisa Keogh for saying that ldquowomen have vaginas. This was in a debate where she was invited to state how she defined ldquowoman. She said that, in her opinion, it was essentially based on biology and a womanrsquos reproductive physiology. She also said that ldquomen are stronger than women on account of their sex, and that male-bodied transwomen should not be competing in womenrsquos sporting events. These are views that would be endorsed by the vast majority of adults, and indeed by Americarsquos leading transgender advocate, Caitlyn Jenner.Abertayrsquos response should have been to dismiss objections to her expressing these opinions in open debate. Yet, principal Seaton has authorised a disciplinary investigation into Lisa Keogh, threatening her with expulsion on the grounds that her views may be ldquooffensive and ldquodiscriminatory.:NEIL MACKAYS BIG READ: It was like Lord of the Flies - Horric accounts of abuse could be boarding schoolsrsquo lsquoMeToorsquo momentHe appears to believe that the university is under a legal obligation under equalities legislation to investigate complaints about comments that supposedly violate the protected characteristic of ldquogender reassignment.Principal Seaton is wrong. Equalities legislation does nothing of the sort. In fact, it upholds Lisa Keoghrsquos right to express her gender-critical opinion. This was made absolutely clear last month by Baroness Falkner, the new chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The views of feminists like Lisa Keogh are in no way discriminatory or hate speech. She said that it is ldquoentirely reasonable to believe that women are defined by their sex and no-one should be ldquopenalised or abused for saying so. ldquoSomeone can believe that people who self-identy as a dferent sex are not the dferent sex that they self-identy, she said.Arguably, it should be Abertayrsquos principal under investigation for conniving in this witch-hunt. In a dignied and restrained interview on BBC Womanrsquos Hour last week, Ms Keogh, a mother of two, explained the distress shersquod suffered being forced to defend herself against this Kafkaesque inquisition. In the midst of sitting her law exams she has had the threat of expulsion hanging over her. Not to mention the abuse she has received from student activists calling her ldquoa typical, cis white woman and much worse.These misguided and unlawful actions by university principals are creating a hostile environment in Scotlandrsquos universities. It extends far beyond Edinburgh and Abertay.The threat of sanctions or stressful disciplinary procedures is chilling debate and making lecturers hesitate to discuss controversial issues. Yet this is precisely what any university teacher should be doing. As for research,academics are looking over their shoulders at Twitter, nothing truly original will ever get done. Just a lot of advocacy research designed to confirm whatever prejudices are acceptable on social media.If universities do not enforce freedom of speech and opinion they cannot perform their proper . Scottish taxpayers expect them to do teaching and research ndash not pursue vendettas against wrongthink. Taxpayer-remunerated principals like Peter Mathieson, earning twice the Prime Ministerrsquos salary, are violating their own university charters, which uphold academic freedom and also free speech provisions of international conventions like the ECHR.:Heralds Higher Education Awards: Hard work and dedication pays off for finalistsNor do university bosses, minds addled by culture war, realise the reputational damage these cases are inflicting on their institutions. Edinburgh University used to get rectors like myself to schmooze rich, potential donors and wealthy American parents willing to pay exorbitant fees.

Just how do you hurt a military junta while ensuring that the people it oppresses are not hurt too Itrsquos over  days now since the February  coup in Myanmar when the army under Senior General Min Aung Hlaing seized power, overthrowing and detaining the elected civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Since then, given the widespread protests and brutal crackdown by the regime alongside calls for international sanctions and boycott campaigns, Myanmar has been both a chaotic place to do business and posed an ethical challenge for foreign companies with links to the country.In few other sectors has this been more apparent than in the countryrsquos garments industry. The announcement then last week by international clothing companies including HM and Primark saying they have resumed placing orders with suppliers in Myanmar for the first time following the coup has once again thrown the spotlight on what qualies as ethical trading and due diligence over human rights and supply chains.Both the UK and Swedish companies were among those that suspended orders from the south-east Asian country because of human rights concerns and civil unrest. This is a country where nearly half a million people are employed in factories producing textiles for retailers that also include, among many others, Gap, Next, Adidasand Zara.Shortly after the military seized power, HM was among the  foreign investors in Myanmar who signed a statement committing to the country and employees there during developments of ldquodeep concern. Subsequently, HM said it had been shocked ldquoby the use of deadly force against protesters in Myanmar.lsquoNo direct linksrsquoAS the worldrsquos second-biggest fashion retailer, HM has more than , people relying on jobs at its textile hubs and says its decision now to resume placing orders is based on both concern over job losses and making good on commitments to its Myanmar suppliers. After due diligence, HM has now concluded that as a company it has no direct links with the military in Myanmar.ldquoWe are now looking for legal guidance on how to handle any potential indirect links international companies may have, the retailer assured.ldquoWith our decision we want to avoid the imminent risk of our suppliers having to close their factories which would inevitably result in unemployment for tens of thousands of garment workers, the Swedish company explained.In turn, Primark said it was committed to honouring its existing orders from its Myanmar suppliers ldquohowever long they take to fulfil, adding that it had ldquorecommenced placing some orders with our key strategic suppliers in the country.But as the Financial Times last week pointed out, CA, the Belgian-German-Dutch chain of fast-fashion retail stores, has adopted a dferent stance, telling its suppliers that ldquowe are at this point ndashunless we see signicant improvements within the country ndash not placing any new orders.And so once again, as with other similar global crises in the past, in Myanmar today the question of just how corporate groups should respond to such challenges remains a subject of some industry debate.For those foreign companies operating in the country their presence has long been a juggle between high risk and potential high reward. After half a century of military rule, the opening up of one of Asiarsquos last frontier markets in  led to a surge in foreign direct investment.Huge investmentIN the specic case of Myanmarrsquos garments and apparel industry, foreign investment has surged over the past decade as economic reforms and an end to Western sanctions and trade deals helped establish the sector as the greatest symbol of its nascent emergence as a manufacturing hub.Myanmar garment shipments rose from less than  billion in , about  per cent of exports, to more than .bn in , about % of exports, according to UN Comtrade data.The first blow to this increasingly lucrative sector came with the coronavirus pandemic which as it plunged the world into recession, choked consumer demand, resulting in tens of thousands of lost garment factory jobs in Myanmar and where in Asia.But Myanmarrsquos garment industry was then hit with another blow in the shape of the coup. Since then, it has been workers and trade union leaders, many from within the garment sector, who have played a leading role in organising protests against the military junta.As international condemnation of the coup and the crackdown against these protests grew, European and US fashion brands, among them HM, Primark, Next and Italyrsquos Benetton, began to express through statements their respective positions and stances.While HM and Primark initially simply halted orders, Next said it would split its orders previously going to Myanmar between Bangladesh, Cambodia and China, while Benetton said it would mainly move business to China.ldquoThey donrsquot want to abandon Myanmar ... but itrsquos being forced upon them, said Peter McAllister of Ethical Trade Initiative , a labour rights organisation whose members include European high-street brands.Speaking to Reuters Business News last month, McAllister said that it would be very dficult for Myanmarrsquos garment sector to recoverChinese investors left, given that its estimated Chinese nationals fund nearly one-third of Myanmarrsquos  garment factories, according to the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association. That would make the Chinese by far the largest investor group.And therein lies the real problem given that a few Chinese-financed garment factories have in some instances found themselves razed to the ground as anti- Chinese sentiment grew along with the belief that Beijing was supplying, directing and on the international stage diplomatically defending Aung Hlaingrsquos regime.But this still begs the question: why would people who earn their living from these factories want to burn them down Nick Vyas, an associate professor at the University of Southern Calornia and an expert in end-to-end global supply chain management, believes some protesters see such factories as obstacles to the type of change they want.ldquoThe entire protest in Myanmar is led by the people and a big chunk of this group thatrsquos leading this protest, the ones who donrsquot want to go back to the past and live under the dictatorial military rule, are the people working in the garment factories, Vyas explained in an interview with Insider, the financial global news portal.ldquoThese people are working six days a week, sometimes seven days a week, and there are disputes sometimes about not being paid overtime, issues with benefits, and not being able to unionise.ldquoSo even before this military protest and the coup, there has been some bad history with the previous government of Aung San Suu Kyi not standing up for workerrsquos rights, Vyas said, adding that because the factories are ownedby China, some protesters view themas part of the cycle that prevents change.Cheap labourVyas describes the cycle as follows: ldquoThe garment workers provide cheap labour to these factories, which helps China grow its influence in Myanmar. Then, Chinarsquos lack of support for protesters bolsters the military regime, which then cracks down on pro-democracy movements.Itrsquos a complicated political situation, one that only adds to the existing challenges of how to operate an ethical trading and supply chain approach that does not appease the junta but does not jeopardise the livelihoods of workers, most of them women who earn as little as , kyata day, the lowest rates in the region.Views dfer on the best approach.Chris Sidoti was part of a UN-ledfact-finding mission which in  urged foreign firms to cut business ties with Myanmarrsquos military over human rights abuses and pursue private sector investments there instead.He sees the situation now as dferent with a military regime in place that has taken over every aspect of government, making it now risky to do any business there. ldquoIf businesses are responsible, they will put everything on hold at this point, Sidoti told Reuters barely a month after the coup, before going on to form an independent advisory group on Myanmar with some other former UN investigators.But, as history has shown, sometimes sanctions hurt more than they help. Previous sanctions on Myanmar have had a humanitarian impact. For example, the US state department estimated that a  US ban on Burmese textile imports cost -, jobs .Given such past experiences, other activist groups today have called for a more nuanced approach, conscious of the economic fragility of Myanmar and the vast poverty that still prevails in much of the country.Long before the coup, Myanmar was widely being described as a ldquofragile state because of its economic uncertainty, institutional dys, and political instability. But the danger now, say some analysts, is that a heavy-handed blanket approach of punitive sanctions could easily turn it into a failed state.A nuanced approach, say observers, is vastly dferent from those expanded sanctions by Western governments targeting the vast network of the Myanmar militaryrsquos economic assets, which are based on two conglomerates: Myanmar Economic Holdings Limitedand Myanmar Economic Corporation .ldquoThe debate over the effectiveness of sanctions is bedevilled by many complex iables, including the objectives of the sanctions and the amount of international compliance, observed veteran journalist, filmmaker and Asia-watcher Tom Fawthrop recently in the online magazine, The DiplomatldquoIn addition, the politics of sanctions could be dferentiated into the good, the bad, and the ugly, Fawthrop added.Limited leverageSome also stress that the international communityrsquos ability to influence developments is finite. ldquoThe outside world has limited leverage, the West in particular, says the ICGrsquos Richard Horsey.ldquoThat doesnrsquot mean the West should sit on its hands and do nothing, but it means their actions will not have a determinative effect on what happens.Horsey told the Financial Times recently: ldquoItrsquos a huge problem for the region, and a problem for the international community ... itrsquos a human catastrophe, and one that has direct implications on Myanmarrsquos neighbours.While government sanctions are one thing the corporate approach could be something  again, say activistsrsquo groups, while insisting that Western brands still need to be rigorous with due diligence as to who they work with.The rights group Burma Campaign UK has called on companies not to abandon Myanmar workers but instead look at ways similar to HMrsquos approach highlighted ndash to maintain placing orders with suppliers albeit under strict scrutiny.John Bray, director at business consultancy Control Risks, said that pressure on firms in Myanmar needed to be guided by an assessment of ldquocomplicity.ldquoIf you are providing a service for the Myanmar people, which they are paid for and which promotes the development of the economy, I donrsquot think yoursquore complicit in what is going on in the streets, said Bray.For the moment there remain some Myanmar union leaders and rights groups that continue to urge clothing chains to stop buying from suppliers in the country to intensy economic pressure on Min Aung Hlaingrsquos junta.But equally there are others who stress that the proceeds from the garment industry for the most part do not go directly into the regimersquos coffers, unlike industries like gemstones, timber, and oil andgas.Many in this latter camp are of the view that what matters more than anything right now is to keep alive structures and jobs outside of the juntarsquos control that will keep people working, eating and afloat.Just how many other clothing companies and retailers make the same decision as HM and Primark, and now resume placing orders with suppliers in Myanmar, remains to be seen.ldquoThe brands feel they have a commitment to the country, and just cutting and running wonrsquot solve anybodyrsquos problems, said Vicky Bowman, director of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Businessthat advocates for human rights.Itrsquos quite a dilemma, but just how many of us, I wonder, will even pause to give it a thought next time we pick up a garment with a label that says ldquoMade in Myanmar."},{"url":null,"title":"eurovision-uk-entry-james-newman-scores-nil-points-eurovision-italyw-ins","story":"The competition, which was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, after the show was

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledges the anxiety that some travellers may have.Loganair chief commercial officer Kay Ryan said: ldquoWe are delighted to play a part in helping showcase Shetlandrsquos stunning scenery and all the great reasons to visit this beautul part of the United Kingdom.ldquoWe are also extremely mindful of our passengersrsquo well-being, and full details of our lsquoFlysafersquo healthy flying protocols are available on our website, along with our lsquoFlexprotectrsquo programme which outlines our flexible bookings conditions as we continue to transition out of travel restrictions.Shetlanders Neil and Natasha Clubb took part in the filming ndash spending the day as ldquotourists enjoying the scenery and famed islesrsquo hospitality.Mr Clubb said being involved was great fun.ldquoWersquove not told many people about it so I canrsquot wait until my friends in Glasgow see it on the TV and realise that itrsquos us,# he said.ldquoThe filming experience was really good fun. We had a whole night in Fjara filming and then down in St Ninianrsquos Isle and up in Eshaness. It was fascinating seeing how the filming is done.ldquoI hope the advert encourages people to come up to Shetland and enjoy all that it has to offer. Therersquos lots of opportunities to get outdoors, from cycling and paddle boarding to birdwatching and fishing. It really is an adventure playground.Although the finished project looks spectacular, the Shetland weather added an extra challenge for Burra-based film-maker Stephen Mercer.He shot the footage in April, during the cold snap that left snow lying on the ground for weeks. Mr Mercer said it was an interesting project and added that, frosty conditions aside, the ldquoamazing locations helped sell the destination.Promote Shetland is stressing the need for all visitors to exercise caution when travelling this year and has published guidance urging all tourists to take two lateral flow tests before making their journey.The project was supported by the STV Growth Fund and match-funding from Promote Shetland and Loganair...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DUNVEGAN-SHOW-GENERAL-2.jpg","title":"dunvegan show postponed due to covid","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe annual event, which celebrated its th anniversary in , boasts an assortment of attractions, activities and stalls for all the family, including stock competitions, a dog show, a tug of war, live music, a range of entertainment for children, and a wide iety of food and drink.The day provides a boost to the local economy, with people from all over Skye and beyond taking part in the bonanza, while the show is also a hit with visitors staying on the island from across the globe.On Monday, the decision was announced on the Dunvegan Show’s Facebook page following a meeting held by event organisers the Durinish and Bracadale Agricultural Association.: “With the uncertainty of Covid, and based on things we have heard from the Highland Council, we decided it would be best to postpone the show for another year.“I would say back in February therewere hopes that it might go ahead but the decision to postpone it for this year was unanimous.”He added: “There were a lot of people who didn’t attend the meeting, but I spoke to them in the weeks leading up to it and they all thought it was too dficult for it to go ahead – which is a shame.“I think the Portree show will be in the same boat, as will all the shows across the country.“It is very disappointing.” asked Mr Beatonthe association had any concerns over the availability of the venue for future shows given that Highland Council proposals to redevelop Dunvegan Primary School would include the current sports field land which is used for the event.He said: “At the moment the plans for the new school are looking to consolidate any community events, so once the new building is up and running we are hopeful that we will still have an area there and a location for the show.“But I’d imagine the issue going forward would be about building works. If they want to concentrate these during the summer holidays, then we might have to look for an alternative location for the showthere is too much work going on at the site.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3812694.jpg--.jpg?1621502297000\n","title":"church launches new youth app","story":" THE Presbyterian Church in Irelandhas sought to respond to the impact of the pandemic by supporting and developing congregational le across PCI’s -plus churches with a range of resources. The latest initiative is the brand new PCI Youth App.Rev David Thompson, Secretary to the Council for Congregational Le and Witness, explained that one of key elements of fruitful youth ministry is effective communication, which was challenging before Covid-, but has become even more so in present circumstances. The new app will allow congregations to safely and effectively keep in touch with young people, leaders and parents.”With a number of default ‘pages’, which can then be customised by congregations as their own ‘affiliate’ app, it brings everything together in one place, that is easily accessible to everyone involved in a church’s youth ministry. Congregations with less time and resources can start off with a basic template and build as their needs change, but others may want to be a little more adventurous, which makes it not just a useful tool for these times of additional challenge, but one that will continue to be useful long into the future.David Thompson explained that this makes the App very flexible, “As a Council, we were delighted to receive funding from Northern Ireland’s Education Authority to make the App freely available to  congregations and we have really been encouraged by its steady uptake by congregations. We hope that it will prove invaluable in effectively communicating not only what is happening, when and where, especially when our youth groups can’t meet in person.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3813137.jpg--.jpg?1621509111000\n","title":"moy park offer jab at work to employees","story":"Moy Park is facilitating its Northern Ireland workforce with the opportunity to receive the COVID- vaccination at work.

The trio were cared for at the centre after a number of litters were seized at the port, with puppies being taken into the care of local dog rescues across Mid-Antrim.Originally four puppies were brought to the Ballymena Rehoming Centre by authorities, and were named Neo, Asher, April and Daffy by staff there. However, after receiving an initial vet check-up, they were found to have contracted parvovirus and despite best efforts by the team to help her, April sadly passed away. Conor O’Kane, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena said: “When they arrived, we could tell they had been through a traumatic experience and that something was wrong. We had them immediately checked over by a vet and after it was confirmed they had parvovirus they began treatment but unfortunately nothing could be done for April. “We believe they were under the age of eight weeks which is too young to be taken away from their mum or to undertake such signicant travel. After around four weeks of treatment, Asher, Daffy and Neo received a clean bill of health during that time, they had relaxed more and really started to come out of their shells. “It wasn’t long before we were able to find them new owners prepared to give them all the love and care they need to live happy lives, despite their dficult start in le.” Paula Boyden, Veterinary Director at Dogs Trust,said: “An ongoing and very serious issue that faces dogs and potential owners is the illegal trade of puppies. Alongside other animal welfare organisations in Northern Ireland, we have been campaigning for stronger and better enforcement of dog breeding regulations. “It is important that an improved, robust licensing system is developed in Northern Ireland in order to tackle unscrupulous breeders and sellers, alongside effective inspection of licenced breeders to ensure the welfare of dogs. As well as requiring every dog breeder to be registered or licensed, these credentials should be a legal requirement on any advertising that promotes the sale of dogs.” Every year puppies are illegally imported into Great Britain and mis-sold via online ads to unsuspecting dog lovers who think they are getting a healthy, happy home-bred puppy. Dogs Trust is urging potential dog owners to follow the charity’s responsible purchasing advice when getting a puppy:  Potential owners should always call the puppy seller beforehand and should never make any payment in advance of seeing or meeting their new pet  Pitfalls can be avoiding by not rushing into purchasing a puppy and following our buyer advice so potential dog owners aren’t ‘dogfished’. Always ask to see puppy and mum together at their home, evenits via video call to comply with coronavirus restrictions. Ask lots of questions and expect to be asked lots of questions as a good breeder will want to know where the puppy is going  All puppies should be microchipped at eight weeks old and registered to the breeder as the first keeper. Potential owners should be able to check whether paperwork such as pedigree papers, microchipping, proof of vet checks and vaccinations, all match  If, for whatever reason, something doesn’t feel right or you feel pressured into buying when you see or visit them, do not proceed and report to Trading Standards  We would recommend potential owners consider adopting a rescue dog before purchasing a puppy, howeveryou are planning on purchasing a puppy, then make sure you do your homework. Dogs Trust is changing the tale for dogs like Neo, Asher and Daffy.

Photo: Kelvin BoyesJohn BreslinMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThere has been no immediate flight price spike following the latest loosening of overseas travel restrictions for Northern Ireland — while those in the industry say holidaymakers are remaining cautious. There are concerns and some confusion over the test needed to be taken by those ing to Northern Ireland, with those from the green list countries told they will need a PCR test rather than the much less expensive lateral flow one for those landing back in England.There was no spike in the price of flights from Belfast to Portugal#s Algarve following the announcement the country is on the green list under the traffic light system for travel.Flights for a family of four in the first two weeks of July have remained steady at around £,, with both EasyJet and Jet. There were plenty of seats available last night on a selection of flights.Travel agents are busy fielding plenty of calls but there is no rush to book as people appear to be holding off and waiting for more choices, said Sandra Corkin, managing director of Oasis Travel in Belfast.Staff at the agency, still limited as some remain on furlough, are busy fielding calls from potential travellers this summer and  but also those who booked last year and were unable to go on their holiday.Whenever England put some countries on to the green list, people knew Northern Ireland would follow so we were taking names and details of people anxious to get away, Ms Corkin said.But it is still a far cry from normal and they are limited to where they can go so a lot of people are still waiting.Most of those actually booking are those where there are no children in the party, while many families are holding off as they will not be travelling until later in the summer.Certainly some people are determined to get away and we have picked up some business, others do not want to be stuck to Portugal.People are still interested in going to Portugal but are worried about the cost of the PCR test, up to £ per person, it’s been warned.NIDirect has all the information on required testing, a Department of Health spokesman said, adding a link to information on travelling from a green list country.You must take a Covid- PCR test on or before day two after you arrive. This must be booked prior to travel, according to the site.On another page of NIDirect related to travelling from abroad, those ing are told they can take either a PCR test of a lateral flow test,For a family of four, the need for PCR tests could add up to £ to the cost of the holiday. They can cost up to £ compared to £ for lateral flow tests.Travel agents fielding calls, particularly from families planning to travel in July or August, are confused at the dference in the rule between Northern Ireland and England.It is a question I have asked myself, why PCR here and lateral flow allowed in England, said Ms Corkin.

Credit: Jonathan Porter PresseyeGillian HallidayTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailCovid vaccine passports are being prepared for Northern Ireland citizens, the Department of Health has said.The department told the Belfastyesterday that it is currently working “on a solution to enable proof of vaccination to the agreed standard”.The development comes as the Executive announced this week that international travel to allow citizens here to travel overseas will resume from Monday.Travellers and holiday makers can avail of a new traffic light system, which will enable travel to a limited number of countries in Europe and beyond.The new system categorises countries as either red, amber or green based on their coronavirus risk, with dferent rules for each.Countries on the red list have the most restrictions.A Department of Health spokesperson “anticipated that a paper based option will be available in the first instance, from a specialist printing service.This requires infrastructure to be developed, allowing citizens to request certication which is securely linking to their personal data,” they added.“Further details will follow shortly. In the meantime it should be noted that neither GP practices or other health and social care organisations are able to issue letters for travel purposes.”Further details regarding the traffic light system is available via the NIDirect website.It is understood millions of pounds, including £m in resources and £.m capital allocation, has been made available to the department for vaccination certication and a form of digital citizen ID.In the UK’s devolved nations, a format for certication letters, to enable proof of vaccination, has only been agreed in recent days. Last month Health Minister Robin Swann said vaccine passports here should be limited to international travel and large events only.Mr Swann said he would not be supportive of using vaccine certications for gaining access to hospitality providers or close-contact service businesses.The utilisation of Covid vaccine passports to access hospitality or close-contact services is not something that sits comfortably with me,” he explained.But there#s a necessity, or a possibility, for the utilisation for international travel, but not for accessing domestic services and support.”Meanwhile, the Irish government’s road map for theof international travel could be ready next week, the Republic’s Tourism Minister Catherine Martin said.It comes as Ireland’s Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said the country is hoping to sign up to the EU#s Digital Green Certicate as soon as possible.The issue is to be discussed by the Irish cabinet next week and Ms Martin said a clear plan will be crucial for the recovery of Ireland#s tourism sector.She said: I hope next week government will be providing a road map for international tourism. That is really, really critical for tourism to recover.It accounts for % of tourism revenue. I#m acutely aware of that as Minister for Tourism and also of the supports that are needed, so there#s no clf-edge for the industry.”Belfast Most ReadBelfastopinion poll: Northern Ireland#s changing political landscape as support for parties revealedIn pictures: Supporters at Irish Cup final between Larne and Linfield as gates reopenTV doctor Christian Jessen tells Arlene Foster libel hearing he invented ping-pong storyVaccine passports ‘being prepared for use by NI citizens’Suzanne BreenOpinionUneasy lies the crown as new DUP leader is given a reality check​​​​​​​Top VideosPlayPoll puts the DUP on just %PlayVideo: Searching for Taylor Swt in Belfast PlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISLatest CoronavirusNo travel price spike… but no big rush to get away eitherMurphy upbeat about a complete end to lockdowns as no new deaths recorded yesterdayCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling average£m health boost part of new Covid funding for NILatestIvan LittleOpinionThe same old Storey in dysal NI‘No link’ between weapons stash and armed loyalistsWilson rubbishes former top Tory’s ‘poof’ claimBurnett: I struggled with retirement but I’m very happy nowEx-UVF boss attacked over cocaine dealing claims,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The party has fallen % from our January poll, but remains just ahead of its .%  Assembly election result.Extensive rebuilding work in the last few years appears unable to entice new voters, but the party continues to maintain its loyal base.The Greens, People Before Profit and others and independents all sit on % of the vote. How the polling was carried outPolling was carried out online from .pm on May  to pm on May , targeting the established Northern Ireland LucidTalk online opinion  , and which is balanced to be demographically representative of Northern Ireland. Some , full responses were received, and these were ‘weighted down’ to a , NI representative data-set used for analysis in terms of the final results. Data was weighted by age, sex, socio-economic group, previous voting patterns, constituency, constitutional position, party support, and religious affiliation.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rory Gallaghers men have one foot in a promotion semi-final with a chance for the county to climb back into Division  for the first time since . It was a marker and an exhibition of counter-attacking football. Derry pulled themselves wide, using every inch of Owenbegs expansive surface and attacked Fermanagh relentlessly down the middle.

And when Ethan Doherty superbly rode a tackle, he gave it to McKinless on the overlap who cooly slotted to the net, ending the game as a contest. When Josh Largo-Ellis hauled Ciaran McFaul down and was sent to the sin-bin, Shane McGuigan slotted home the resultant penalty. It was walk in the park material this point, with the voice of Rory Gallagher still urging his troops to keep their foot on the gas.

Rory Gallaghers men have one foot in a promotion semi-final with a chance for the county to climb back into Division  for the first time since . It was a marker and an exhibition of counter-attacking football. Derry pulled themselves wide, using every inch of Owenbegs expansive surface and attacked Fermanagh relentlessly down the middle. Gareth McKinless and Ethan Doherty tore Fermanaghs defence apart when Derry broke from deep. At midfield, Derry totally dominated the visitors kick-outs in the first-half. It was like the win over Longford all over again. googletag.cmd.push Their tally of - from play will have been another pleasing point for Rory Gallagher.

Shane McGuigan got the home team off the mark before Derry crashed into action. After a period of keep ball, the rampant Ethan Doherty burst clear before hammering to the top corner. McGuigan, Heron and Glass were all on target for Derry as they went into a - to - lead. Fermanagh were hampered by the loss of Eoin Donnelly after injury. googletag.cmd.push A free from Quigley cut the gap to four at the break, - to -. A thumping Ciaran McFaul point had Derry on the scoreboard early in the second-half, before the floodgates opened with four second-half goals. The first one came after Stephen McGillion coughed up a cheap ball at midfield. And when Ethan Doherty superbly rode a tackle, he gave it to McKinless on the overlap who cooly slotted to the net, ending the game as a contest. When Josh Largo-Ellis hauled Ciaran McFaul down and was sent to the sin-bin, Shane McGuigan slotted home the resultant penalty. It was walk in the park material this point, with the voice of Rory Gallagher still urging his troops to keep their foot on the gas.     McGuigan added a second goal from play and Niall Toner bagged a fth to put Derry odds on to pick up a semi-final spot.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city.

Mr Floyd, a  -year-old black man, died on May  last year while being restrained by a police officer Derek Chauvin. His death sparked worldwide protests in support of the Black Lives Matter campaign. Chauvin was recently found guilty of second-degree murder and is awaiting sentenced. The North West Migrants Forumis marking the first anniversary of Mrs Floyds death with a series of events in Derry. The event schedule includes the launch of an online book of remembrance and an online memorial service that is taking place on May  from .pm to pm. googletag.cmd.push The service will be live-streamed through the NWMF Facebook page. Confirmed guest speakers for the memorial service include: Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown Dr Umar Al-Qadir, chair of the Irish Muslim Peace and Integration Council Colum Eastwood, leader of the SDLP andBrian Tierney, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council. NWMF is also asking members of the public to light a candle at .pm after the online memorial service and display it on their windows in memory of Mr Floyd. They are then encouraged to share a photo of their candle on social media, tagging the NWMF and using the hashtag #uniteaganistracism. googletag.cmd.push Lilian Seenoi-Barr, Director of Programmes at the North West Migrants Forum, said: “It’s hard to believe that it has been a year since the brutal murder of George Floyd in America, a tragedy that should never have happened. “We must continue to work together to stamp out racism and hold accountable the structures and systems that have allowed such heinous acts to continue to occur. “This includes the PSNI and the NI executive just as much as the powers that be in USA. So let us connect, unite and be the change that we want to see within our communities, towns and cities.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The young defender scored after just three minutes at the RSC, heading in a Will Patching free kick from close range, and that proved to be enough for the Candystripes. City were completely dominant in the first half, but it was a dferent story in the second half, although Waterford ultimately lacked the quality to take any of the half chances which came their way. It took just three minutes for Derry City to take the lead, doing so with their first attack. Goalkeeper Brian Murphy needlessly raced from his area and fouled James Akintunde in the corner, gting the visitors a free kick. Patching delivered the ball into the near post where Boyce rose to head in the opening goal from close range. googletag.cmd.push The Candystripes dominated the opening stages of the game and it should have been - on  minutes when Patching ran at the Waterford defence before curling an effort at goal which Murphy could only parry straight into the path of Akintunde. The forward opted not to shoot first time however, trying to take it around the goalkeeper, but Murphy did enough to turn Akintunde away from the goal and the chance was gone. It took Waterford  minutes before they tested Nathan Gartside at the other end, and it was a big moment in the first half as the Derry goalkeeper was at his best to keep out Shane Grfin’s free kick from  yards. Grfin, who scored from a similar position earlier in the season at the Brandywell, tried his luck again, but this time Gartside was equal, ing to his right to push the ball behind for a corner. googletag.cmd.push Waterford were much livelier at the start of the second half and they could have gone level when Jamie Mascoll’s cross picked out Adam O’Reilly completely unmarked in the area, but he got his header all wrong and failed to even test Gartside. City did not enjoy anywhere near the same dominance in the second half, as Waterford played a high pressing game, which made the players in red and white very uncomfortable. They were very early caught out by a Mascell free kick on  minutes, as John Martin crept free to the back post, but he was unable to bring the ball under control and the chance was again gone.     That was as good as it got through for the home side as Derry head out to pick up a valuable three points away from home.  Teams Waterford: Brian Murphy, Darragh Power, Cameron Evans, Josh Collins, Shane Grfin, Adam O’Reilly, James Waite, John Martin, Niall O’Keefe, Jamie Mascoll, Eric Molloy .

The OATS Project - Orienteering, Athletics and Triathlon Stars, is an exciting programme aimed at introducing young people to a new sport, or bringing them back to sport after the restrictions of the pandemic. The programme launches this Sunday, May , and is being funded by Sport NI as part of the Project Re-Boot Build Back Better initiative. It will run over the next four weeks at St. Columb’s Park in what is expected to be the first of four seasonal events of its kind. googletag.cmd.push Project Manager Bridgeen Byrne, of City of Derry Spartans AC, explains that the event will host up to  local kids, aged from -, with the emphasis being on fun. We’re doing four programmes - spring, summer, autumn, winter – and the first is this Sunday,” she said. “It will be four consecutive Sundays where three groups of  kids will rotate between the three sports of orienteering, athletic and triathlon. They will be introduced to these sports in a fun environment where they can meet dferent people from other schools. “The emphasis is on fun and enjoyment and getting back outdoors, getting active and meeting new people. It will be skills-based throughout, from the three sports to communication, working together as a team and even healthy eating.” googletag.cmd.push  Support The OATS Project has received the backing of Derry City  Strabane District Council, a number of schools in the city on both sides of the community, the British Orienteering Federation and Athletics Northern Ireland. There will be qualied coaches in every sport as well as A-Level P.E students from local schools who have volunteered to help the coaches roll out the programme. Getting back outside after a frustrating year for everyone is the aim of the project, with Bridgeen hoping to really give local kids a boost after a dficult  months. “Getting outside for that endorphin release, getting fresh air and being out with nature. These are all ways we can better our well-being to get ourselves back,” she added.     “We’re super excited about making the project a reality. It grew from a tiny little seed to this huge event that’s going to take up with full year with spring, summer, autumn and winter programmes. “Some young people haven’t had the opportunities they would usually have in the past year – they haven’t been able to do the things they would be able to do or meet the people they would be able to meet in and around school. This gives them the opportunity to get out and do dferent things and meet dferent people and they could be friends for le then.” Well-being This Sunday will be the first steps for the OATS project but Byrne is hoping that dferent organisations can continue to work together beyond this year, with the physical and mental well-being of young people the most important aspect of all. “It’s a one-year project but we would like to grow it beyond that,” she admitted. “It encourages clubs to work together. You are learning all the time, you are concentrating, you are outdoors in the environment. It’s really good and it will make young people far more aware of their surroundings, when they are outside especially with orienteering because you will be looking at nature far more, and you will be looking after your space. All the spaces around Derry are beautul now and we will be using dferent spaces around the town throughout the year. “In the last couple of years we have run two well-being programmes, and during lockdown we worked with Action Mental Health who ran three programmes for us. Because of lockdown we were concerned with how young people were feeling so we had programmes for three dferent age groups. “We’re always trying to look after the well-being of the young people and trying to get them to come outdoors, and encourage them to participate in sport. Once you’re involved with sport, everything  will work better – it will hep you academically, it will help family le, and help when you’re outside meeting people.” Anyone interested in participating this Sunday is asked to contact Bridgeen on  or by emailing bridgeen@aol.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State. The use of force by the Army that resulted in his death was disproportionate.Fr Mullanrsquos youngest brother, Patsy, said that he and the rest of his family always knew the  year-old priest was innocent.Now , he said the first learnt something was wrong when he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy that day on the RTE late news.ldquoI knew right away it would be him, he was the type of person and would be out to help anyone in trouble or who was injured. That was just his nature. Unfortunately it was his downfall, said Mr Mullan, who still lives in Portaferry.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who would have been among people all the time, helping people.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny.Mr Mullan was left unimpressed with an apology that Prime Minister Boris Johnston made in a call to former First Minister Arlene Foster.ldquoI wouldnrsquot have wanted an apology from him actually. I donrsquot have much time for him at the best of times because I donrsquot think hersquos the best person for that job.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan, his son Hugh and other family members attended nearly all  days the inquest since it started in November .Mrs McGrattan said that hearing the judgersquos findings ldquolted a weight of me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows, she said.ldquoTo hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

They have been allowed to continue for too long.ldquoPotentially using body cams and CCTV to apprehend offenders is welcome but, as I have consistently argued, there is a need to beef up existing legislation and work alongside other bodies to examine how they have successfully dealt with the problem.The politician said everyone had a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure their rubbish doesnrsquot end up being illegally dumped and to clean up after their pets.ldquoThere is simply no excuse for not doing so, Cllr Walker declared. ldquoWhile most people dispose of their waste properly and clean the mess that their pets create, there are many who donrsquot, caring little for the environment, the districtrsquos appearance or the cost of cleaning up after them. We need affirmative action so those who blatantly disregard the law are made accountable.Cllr Walker said dog dirt posed a major health risk to children who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.He added: ldquoWhile the council has been told that the DNA testing of dog dirt is not feasible as the local authority has no legal power to insist that dog owners register for the service, we still have to get to grips with this issue.ldquoThe enforcement improvement plan is welcome, but it would be so much easier of dog owners cleaned up after their pets.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

footpaths.SAINTFIELD ndash A councillor has this week called for planning officials to ensure a Saintfield primary school has enough room to expand to meet future demand.Mr Robert Burgess says there is increasing concern among teachers and parents that plans to build  new homes at the rear of the Academy Primary School could prevent its future expansion.He said that in addition to restricting the growth of the Listooder Road school, the planned new homes would result in a major increase in traffic in the area which would impact on the safety of young children.Mr Burgess said the safety of the pupils is the schoolrsquos number one concern and confirmed its officials have been in contact with local planners over the past number of months.He said the safety of pupils is already jeopardised as

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny.

My uncle was the first to be shot, then Frank Quinn, the  year-old, who was shot beside him and killed.What hurt Geraldine and the wider Mullan family so much was in press reports Fr Mullan was said to have been involved in a gun battle with soldiers.ldquoHe was such a big part of our family le, for the lies that were told about him were very dficult for us all, she said. ldquoIt was hard enough to lose him, but to lose him like that and then everything afterward was so hard.She said on that fateful day, her uncle had been trying all day to calm things down.ldquoThere was trouble from Loyalists behind Springfield Park and the people in Springfield Park started to evacuate their houses and tried to flee across a piece of waste ground over to Moyard to safety.ldquoBricks and stones were being thrown at their houses and houses were badly damaged. They were carrying children across the waste ground and firing started. A man, Bobby Clarke, was shot and wounded in a field and local people called for a priest as they thought he was going to die.ldquoUncle Hugh had been standing outside his own house and had spent the day ringing the Army, trying to get thing quietened and calmed. He called the Army to tell them that he was going out to the wasteland to help an injured man. Then he got a white cloth, began to wave it and went out onto the wasteland.ldquoHe got to Bobby and he told Uncle Hugh he wasnrsquot too bad. Uncle Hugh said he would go and get him an ambulance but would give him the Anointing of the Sick to help him anyway.ldquoHe did that and he was making his way back to get an ambulance when he was shot. He was shot at least twice and left in the field. Frank Quinn went out to help Uncle Hugh and he was shot and died instantly.The family never received any official explanation about Fr Mullanrsquos death.ldquoIn the early days, we were told that Uncle Hugh had been killed in crossfire during a gun battle, said Mrs McGrattan. ldquoNewspapers reported that he was a gunman, carrying a weapon. No one ever contacted us, there was never a person at the door to tell us what had happened.Along with the joy from last Tuesday of the coronerrsquos ruling that Fr Mullan was an innocent, Mrs McGrattan said there was also a lot of sadness for her.ldquoIt was a sad day as my grandparents, John and Mary, werenrsquot there to hear it, nor were my parents, Teresa and Gerry, my husband Gerard and my brother Hugh Kearney. So many of us have died in those  years and didnrsquot get to hear the good words she used.There was another loss for her family mdash her mother Teresarsquos baby died at birth and her parents moved to England shortly afterwards.Mrs McGrattan said she was really moved to hear the testimonies of civilian witnesses who gave evidence during the inquest.ldquoWhenever Mrs Justice Keegan said that Hughrsquos story was stark and in her opinion, he was a peacemaker, and totally innocent, it lted a weight off me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows. To hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released. It was a great day.She praised and thanked the Portaferry community for their support over the years.ldquoThe people of Portaferry were so generous and so kind to the whole family at that time, actually all through the years. The community held Uncle Hugh in great respect and always have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12626106.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he got there they laughed at him. That patrol had left the besiegedcountry two years ago and instead he was immediately sent off in a helicopter to Lashnagar where he was met by an Irish guardsman named Charlie Naggs who took him to the top of a building, produced a sock and from it a bottle of Jameson’s. Then he was told he would be taking on the liaison outfit between the British and Afghan Army. Soon he was fighting hand-to-hand against the Taliban in Garmsir in Helmand province, shocked by the brutality of a country where women were regularly stoned to death and gay people were hung from cranes.It was a high-adrenaline, bloody theatre of war, and in the midst of it, Doug managed to discover a profound connection with Afghan Major whom he could only communicate with via an interpreter.”We were working alongside the Afghan army against the Taliban and I made a friend called Major Sher Wali. He was killed on the last day of the battle and I was injured. Major Sher Wali was the bravest, noblest man that I have ever met and we didn’t even speak the same language. But we made up a friendship over  days, which is probably one of the strongest I’ve ever had with a person. I feel his death to this day. I was commanding and he got injured and was killed. Such a man. “He had the best smile, the whitest teeth you have ever seen and he wore this brown suit and cloak that was pristine clean. And I remember he came to my rescue. I was in the middle of a battle and I began to feel that I was overrun and he ed on top of me and lay there as a rocket-propelled grenade exploded above my head. He got up, then, with his big smile, and he said, ‘Beattie, we do the fighting, you help us!’ And he got tucked into the enemy. And that is a measure of the man who saved my le.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was  and I was fighting a -day battlein southern Afghanistan. We would fight all day and in the evening we would retreat back to a derelict building. I had to sleep in a Muslim graveyard in a half-dug grave, keeping away from the rockets and gunfire coming in.“I remember reaching out to God then and saying: ‘I want to do my duty, I want to keep my soldiers alive, and I want to live’. And I felt that God reached back to me. I really felt that and I’ve held it ever since. I get attacked a lot by people who think I am not a man of faith, because I am very private about belief. “I am not a church-goer and I have concerns about organised religion but nobody can deny what I felt in that moment in Afghanistan. That battle was one of the most brutal I have ever been involved in. I had to do terrible things and I lost friends and colleagues.”Doug, who has over  years military service, was awarded the prestigious Military CrossHis service in Helmand led to one of the proudest moments of his lewhen he was awarded the Military Cross. Waiting to meet theQueen behind  other men who served, he was anxious about accidentally head-butting the monarch.“All I could think of was this Rowan Atkinson sketch when he’s waiting to meet Her Majesty coming out of a film premiere, and he’s checking his flies and practising his bow and then when the Queen gets to him he accidentally head butts her. I remember thinking ‘Goodness Doug, do not head butt the Queen!’ But when I got to her, and she pinnedthemedal on me, she asked me a question: “What did the we say when she found out you were not in Kandahar ”When the desk job came to nothing and he found himself embedded in the bloodiest of conflicts, he realised he had some explaining to do to Mrs Beattie. ”When I got home my wesaid, ‘Goodness Doug, what happened to you, and I said, you see those computer leads  They were everywhere, I tripped over one and fell flat on my face.”Having made it through the hell of Helmand to become leader of the UUP, Doug is determined to be a progressive voice for unionism. “I want to reach out to all who want to reach out to me. I want people to know that I am genuine, and will work hard for those who I represent, and I genuinely do not care about somebody’s religion, sexual orientation or the colour of their skin. I want to be able to reach across the ide and work with integrity to find pragmatic and workable solutions to the problems unionism currently faces including the removal of the NI Protocol which I believe is counter to the Good Friday Agreement. Let’s work to find an alternative way.”‘I stand for liberal values and honesty’After decades of military service, Beattie decided to turn to politics in, committed as he has always been to serving others and trying to make a dference.”I had reached an age when I was fat, my knees and back had started to go and I was less of a fine Ferrari in need of a makeover and more of a Morris Minor in need of new wheels. I talked to Mike Nesbitt and before long as I was standing to be a councillor, then MLA for Upper Bann and now I find myself as leader of the UUP I am determined to be a progressive force for change. “I’ve had people slam doors in my face because I support same-sex marriage or am pro-choice. But I will not lie about my values and what I believe in. My integrity is so important to me and when I am ousted from political le it will be done because I am honest and some people do not always like that.”Doug is the very man to helm a st century-ready UUP and he intends to bring more women and young people into the party.‘We should never be afraid to admit when the British Military got it wrong’Today Doug, , feels his biggest challenge is trying to get the electorate to understand that he wants to reach out to everybody who wants his help.”As a political leader, Igenuinely want to reach out a hand of friendship to everybody. I think sometimes people say. ‘You’re an ex-soldier, you fought and you killed people, you’re not somebody I want to know.’ The challenge for me is to let people know that I want to respect dference. “People still see Doug Beattie in a military unorm, not somebody who lost a grandson, or his mother at the age of . I want to reach out across the isions we have here and to help build a stronger, more inclusive Northern Ireland. Everybody has something that will enrich our lives, regardless of who they are or what their background is.”Though he was, and will always be, a proud military man, Doug is not reluctant to criticise the British Military when they get things wrong. He still worries about the morality of intervention in Afghanistan, each day, and fears that the progress they fought so hard for was not sufficiently augmented.”We raised the expectation of a people and I think they have been let down. What we saw there was horric. The brutality of the country was like something from the dark ages. We promised these people we were going to lt them out of that. But we’ve left before making sure it is secure and we’ve left people behind. The cost of intervention was high, not just for us but for the Afghan people and I worry the Taliban will gain dominance in certain regions again.”He laments instances where the British Army got it so badly wrong in Northern Ireland and has no hesitation in expressing his sympathy for the Ballymurphy families who finally had their day in court after half a century of campaigning and saw the names of their beloved dead fully exonerated: ”Ballymurphy was wrong and we should not be afraid to criticise when the British Military has got it wrong. As a military man, it’s the right thing to do, it’s about self-reflection. We also got it wrong on Bloody Sunday. But neither should we be afraid to say that the great majority of British soldiers who served here did so with great distinction, compassion and empathy.\u2028”We are in a society here where there is so much hurt and so much pain. We can’t turn it all off. But I wish I could go back to the late s early s to ensure that people got equal rights and that way we could have avoided years of conflict and bloodshed. I wish more than anything that we could do that.”QA: ‘You can gauge a man by how he devours spag bol’Tell us your earliest childhood memories \u2028I am the youngest of six and because my father was a soldier we travelled around a lot.

Photo: Charles McQuillan GettyOn March  this newspaper revealed that just weeks after the DUP said it was blocking recruitment of Irish Sea border inspectors, DUP minister Edwin Poots’s department had advertised for port inspectors.A month earlier the temporary DUP agriculture minister Gordon Lyons dramatically announced that he was halting work on Irish Sea border infrastructure and stopping the recruitment of staff to carry out checks.However, after the revelation that the department had quietly U-turned, it said that the advert had “incorrectly specied” that the staff would be working on the sea border and said it would be halting the recruitment “until further notice”.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Now documents released by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsunder the Freedom of Information Act show that a civil servant, whose name has been blacked out, raised concerns about what they were being asked to do in response to the News Letter revelation.The official said on March  – the day of the story: “I’m going to raise the issue of uncertainty around this because I am confused now as what we are allowed to do.“What has happened is not what was agreed advised to me so I’m going to ask for something formally in writing.“I think this is necessary to protect those of us who are working in this particular work area from accusations that we have been doing something incorrectly.”Another civil servant, whose name has also been blacked out, replied to say that they agreed. The News Letter asked the department to explain what civil servants were told to do verbally – but not in writing – which left them feeling so uncomfortable.Another document shows that chief vet Robert Huey approved the recruitment of port inspectors on  March – the day before the News Letter report. Dr Huey is one of the department’s most senior officials who would be in contact with the minister. DAERA was asked whether Dr Huey either withheld that information from the minister orthe minister did in fact have some knowledge that recruitment was continuing.DAERA responded: “The minister has always been clear that recruitment of port staff should cease until further clarity is received from the UK Government and consideration is given to the requirements for NI Points of Entry by the Northern Ireland Executive.“On March , the department claried to the News Letter that an advertisement seeking to recruit agricultural inspectors, mistakenly specied that new staff would be solely located to the Points of Entry.“The department also confirmed to the News Letter that the minister is not involved in routine recruitment and therefore was unaware of this advert being placed.”The department was also askedany official has been investigated or disciplined for disobeying the minister’s direction. There was no response.Recruitment continued, despite DUP claimAlmost  pieces of internal departmental documentation released to the News letter give scant information about the DUP’s claimed halt to recruiting Irish Sea border staff having made any dference.On February  the then minister, Gordon Lyons, announced: “I instructed my department to halt work on a range of issues relating to work at the ports. This is in and around a number of areas...[including] the additional recruitment of staff...”Internal emails show that officials carried on work on recruitment for weeks.On March , an official emailed what a recruitment agency in relation to “agency Veterinary Inspectors Larne Port”.They said: “As advised there is an urgent need with this request and it gets more pressing with every day that goes by...As I say this is extremely urgent”. Another email said to “avoid delay” because “Larne Port is very short of veterinary resource”.Another email on March , days after the apparent freeze on recruitment, asked an agency for Larne Port inspectors, saying “this is an urgent need”. Two days later they said: “I really need this progressed urgently”. Later that day an email said £, had been cleared for recruiters Premiere Employment Group to fill the posts. Still more staff were being recruited for Warrenpoint Port as late as March .DAERA said Mr Poots was unaware of all this activity.:Sam McBride: After four years at the top of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill has good reason to be nervousSam McBride: Rather than a DUP lurch to the right, this is about toppling the old orderSam McBride: Don’t assume Edwin Poots is more hardline than Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – the truth is more nuancedSam McBride: From his s, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was seen as a future unionist leader – now might be his final chanceSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredSam McBride: How Arlene Foster fell: Even as she dismissed the threat, the knives were being plungedAs Edwin Poots steps forward to contest DUP leadership, Peter Robinson urges cautionSam McBride: The most important firm in Northern Ireland you’ve probably never heard of – but are paying forSam McBride: On the streets and in Stormont, the next few months look bleak for Northern IrelandAnarchy on the Shankill as men and women urge children to riot, with no hint of political protestLeaked internal DUP minutes show fear of looming electoral collapse, and dismay at party’s directionBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says parts of frontier are being ditched for good——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Final decisions will be made based on the above criteria, in addition to the ability to get power to the locations, which is determined by power providers.Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe nextbike e-bike hire scheme in Penarth has proved extremely successful.\"Since its launch, the hire of the bikes has been steadily increasing.ldquoWith the onset of summer, we have implemented a new docking station at Cosmeston, and very soon there will be a new docking station in Sully.\"I am convinced the scheme will only go from strength to strength.ldquoTwo additional docking stations in Dinas Powys will complement the existing nextbike network within the Vale of Glamorgan and provide an additional sustainable transport link between these three areas.\"I would encourage Dinas Powys residents to respond to the consultation as itrsquos important they are located where they are accessible to as many people as possible.Penarthrsquos existing stations are located at the Esplanade, Llandough Hospital, Windsor Road, Penarth Train Station, the Barrage and the recently-installed Cosmeston.While the Penarth bikes can currently only be rented and ed to Penarth stations, the ambition is to eventually link the scheme to nextbikersquos Cardf fleet, meaning commuters will be able to use the e-bikes to make the journey between the town and the city with ease.E-bikes are a combination of a conventional bike with a motor that take some of the effort out of pedalling for the rider. With top speeds of km per hour, the e-bikes can cover greater distances in less time and with less effort than conventional cycles.E-bike rental costs pound per  minutes for customers with a monthly or annual membership, or pound per  minutes on a pay as you ride basis.The consultation runs until May .

Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately, both Sean and his father were thrown from the kayak into the freezing cold water.Sean’s father was washed ashore and despite frantic efforts he was unable to reach his son who was stuck in the water against a wall at the opposite bank. Thankfully a local father and son - Mike Greerand his -year-old son Zachery - were able to pull Sean safely out of the water and alert the emergency services. ]]Due to the severity of the incident, the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service , flown by Air Ambulance Northern Ireland were tasked to the scene along with a number of emergency first response teams.Fortunately Sean has recovered well and as a result of his experience he wanted to do something positive that would potentially help another person who might need the air ambulance in future.Sean’s mum Elaine said, “We wanted to do something that would give back. Air Ambulance NI is a wonderful service that we cannot take for granted. “The service has been tasked to our council area  times in  and it can only help people with donations to support its sustainability. We are so thankful that Sean wanted to do something and that’s him, he has so much grit and determination and we are so proud of him.”Just two months after Sean’s ordeal in the water, both he and his father took on the mighty challenge of summitting Northern Ireland’s highest peak, Slieve Donard to raise funds for the lesaving service. The seven-year-old initially set himself the goal of raising £ but was overwhelmed when his final total came in at £,! His mum said, “Sean is so grateful to every single person who donated to his Just Giving page and helped him smash his target. If the money pays half the fuel or pays towards saving somebody ’s le, it will have been worth it. “Every step Sean took on that mountain really was to help ensure someone  got pre-hospital critical carethey needed it - every penny donated will help that cause.”At the beginning of May, Sean and his family were delighted to be one of the first patient families to visit the air ambulance base with the easing of lockdown restrictions. Sean was delighted to get a tour of the airbase and hear all about how his donation will help others who are potentially in le threatening situations. Mum Elaine commented, “Sean has not stopped talking about his visit to see the air ambulance. He also signed up as a Junior Club member with the charity and so was delighted to wear his branded lanyard and bring along his teddy to get his photo by the helicopter. “He was given a tour, had lots of questions answered and was delighted to hear more about the pilot’s role within the team, as this is something he’s really interested in. “He was also given a copy of the charity newsletter and hasn’t put it down - that’s really helping him with his reading too! We are just so delighted that something that could have turned out to be a devastating situation has had such a positive outcome and we are extremely proud of our young boy who is a big air ambulance fan!”The charity Air Ambulance Northern Ireland, in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, provides the HEMS for Northern Ireland. The service brings urgent medical assistance to anywhere in the province, operating seven days a week for  hours per day. It can get to anywhere in Northern Ireland in approximately twenty-five minutes.How we reported Sean’s rescue in February - read hereEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
