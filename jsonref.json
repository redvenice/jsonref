You want my arms?\u0027 he went on. He would not agree to do the Oscars again, he said, because there was now not enough time left for him to prepare. The Awards are being held on February 24, six weeks from now. \u0027I am not hosting the Oscars this year... right now, from a time perspective, I don\u0027t have the time. \u0027You\u0027re talking about two weeks that I would have to prepare,\u0027 he said.  \u0027I like to call myself a perfectionist. I would want to make sure the production is a great representation of me and my talent.   \u0027I can\u0027t do it this year, it\u0027s not going to happen, in the future if it does it does but it\u0027s not the conversation of today.\u0027 Hart said that the backlash Ellen DeGeneres received for supporting him proved that there was \u0027no ending\u0027. \u0027If you keep feeding this energy, then it\u0027s going to grow,\u0027 he said.            Unamused: Hart was stern as he repeatedly told host Michael Strahan that he would not apologize again for his remarks or explain how he had changed On Tuesday, Hart said the chances of him taking the gig were \u0027very slim\u0027 as he was confronted by photographers while promoting his new film, The Upside, but teased that an announcement may be imminent. \u0027I\u0027m not gonna say anything, and I\u0027m definitely got gonna say it here, but the chances are very slim,\u0027 he said, adding: \u0027I love the Academy, I love everybody that\u0027s involved with the process of building the Oscars and making it. \u0027This year was just a tricky year, so maybe in the future it\u0027ll work out.\u0027   Hart was named as the host of the 91st Academy Awards in December. He took proudly to social media afterwards to announce it but his elation was short-lived. Within days, Twitter users had unearthed his old tweets and demanded that he be removed. Among them were posts where he labeled people \u0027f**gs\u0027 and jokes about what he would do if his son came out as gay. Despite the backlash, Hart refused to apologize and instead quit over the controversy, blindsiding the Academy and leaving them without a host. He said the Oscars gave him an ultimatum apologize or give up the gig. He chose the latter.            Harts homophobic tweets from 2009 - 2011 resurfaced last month after he was given the gig. He deleted them years ago           Hart later appeared on Ellen where she defended him and called for him to get the job back. Her comments enraged the LGBTQ community In Instagram posts afterwards, he said he had already addressed the tweets in the past and refused to e back into the discussion, saying instead that it would only seek to \u0027feed the trolls\u0027. Later, he appeared on Ellen where both he and she called for viewers to embrace growth and change. During their interview, she revealed that she had even called the Academy to ask if Hart could still host the show and said she was told he could. Ellen, who has long been an icon in the LGBTQ community, was lampooned for throwing her support behind the comedian afterwards. Hart later came to her defense, saying: \u0027When did we get to the point where we forgot that we all learn, then we all have the ability to grow and with that growth comes a wealth of knowledge.\u0027You can’t change without a understanding of what GROWTH means.\u0027 On Tuesday, he made a frustrated apology on his radio show where he said: \u0027Once again, Kevin Hart apologizes for his remarks that hurt members of the LGBTQ community.\u0027I apologize. I am now moving on from this because I\u0027m just hoping that the apology is accepted.\u0027 A replacement is yet to be named for the February 24 awards show. Among the possibilities organizers were pondering was to go \u0027SNL-style\u0027 with a rotation of presenters. Good Morning America on Twitter: \u0026quotTHIS MORNING: @KevinHart4real joins us LIVE in Times Square.¿ \u0026quot"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/10/08/8347562-6576431-image-a-47_1547108287933.jpg","title":"More half mothers giving birth aged 30 over","story":"    Just 20,358 mothers who gave birth in 2017 were 19 years-old or under - the lowest since records began in 1938 (pictured)          Over half of mothers who gave birth last year were aged 30 or over as women wait longer to have babies, figures out today reveal (pictured,graph of the average age of mothers in 2017)Japanese PM Shinzo Abe urges Theresa May to avoid no-deal...Share this articleThe ONS said: \u0027A long-term rise has been recorded since 1975 in the average ages of mothers and fathers reflecting trends to delay childbearing to later ages.\u0027Many women are waiting to establish their careers before they choose to settle down and have babies.While others spend longer searching for \u0027Mr Right\u0027 before they want to commit to having a child with their other half.Last year, some 329 women aged 49 or over had a baby, while 1,876 women aged between 45 and 48 gave birth.The average age of fathers has also gone up, with 69 per cent of dads aged 30 or over - up from 65 per cent a decade ago and 60 per cent in 1997. Older mothers are the most likely to have a stillbirth at 6.1 per thousand - lower than the 7.7 a decade ago and the rate of 10.3 in 1997.Office for National Statistics Privacy PolicyThe ONS said: \u0027The stillbirth rate was significantly higher in the most deprived areas (based on mothers’ usual residence) compared with the least deprived areas in England in 2017.\u0027In England, the stillbirth rate in the most deprived areas was 5.5 per 1,000 total births, compared with 3.0 per 1,000 total births in the least deprived areas.\u0027The annual figures also reveal the most popular days to be born - with September the busiest month.The ONS said: \u0027A peak in births in late September shows that more babies are conceived in the weeks leading up to and the days after Christmas than at any other time of the year.\u0027Eight of the top ten dates of birth were towards the end of September, with 26 September being the most popular over the period 1995 to 2017.\u0027The least popular date of birth from 1995 to 2017 was Boxing Day, followed by Christmas Day, with, on average, 1,357 and 1,425 live births respectively. "},{"url":null,"title":"Pictured Harry Meghans 2 5m country bolthole entertain friends","story":"    Bolthole: Harry and Meghan\u0027s secret £2.5million Oxfordshire mansion where they entertain friends.

I’d always enjoyed poetry, and I knew various scraps of Larkin, Blake, Dickinson, Poe and Shelley. As I turned these over in my mind, I had an idea.My career as a novelist and author of books about literary figures was temporarily — I hoped — out of the question. What if I stuffed my head with poetry? Perhaps I might be able to interest people in listening to me recite it to them off by heart?That, at least, was something I could do. But would anyone actually pay me to listen?I had a mortgage, I’d just got engaged and I had a serious, undiagnosed health problem. It was time for action.          Gary Dexter began reciting poems in Norwich city centre (pictured above)\u0027Ladies and Gentlemen, we will win the war!\u0027: How British...Now THAT\u0027s an extraordinary life! From the wife that defied...The captivating foreign socialite who helped Nixon win the...Share this articleMy solution was to become a Norwich street poet. I would approach the good citizens of Norfolk and offer to recite any poem from memory.To start with, I began cramming at the rate of a poem a day, aiming for 30 poems. After a month or so I had my 30, plus a dozen more.It was not an enormous number, but I’d selected a repertoire spread carefully over all periods and styles, so that if I couldn’t produce an inidual poem, I could find a work-around: ‘I’m sorry, I don’t know that particular poem by Betjeman, but here’s another one you might like . . .’Despite the hostility, snubs and brush-offs — some abusive — I received, around one in ten attempts resulted in a poem and payment.After a few days on the streets I found I was making around £12 an hour. Poetry, it seemed, was very important to people — even in the social media-obsessed 21st century, and they were actually prepared to pay for it.(Young people, I found, are also generally more receptive to poetry than older people. In fact, they are generally nicer and more polite than older people, full stop. Unfortunately, they are also poorer.)What would happen next taught me a lesson: something seems to have gone wrong with modern poetry. The poems that people ask for are rhyming poems, many of them 100 or more years old.During the year I went on to spend on the streets, I was able to gain a pretty reasonable idea of people’s favourite poems — the ones I recited over and over again. Here are five of the most beloved from my eventual list of 150.If — by Rudyard Kipling  Rudyard Kipling (pictured above) had penned the poem \u0027If\u0027If you can keep your head when all about youAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,But make allowance for their doubting tooIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:If you can dream — and not make dreams your masterIf you can think — and not make thoughts your aimIf you can meet with Triumph and DisasterAnd treat those two impostors just the sameIf you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spokenTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:If you can make one heap of all your winningsAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginningsAnd never breathe a word about your lossIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinewTo serve your turn long after they are gone,And so hold on when there is nothing in youExcept the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,Or walk with Kings — nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,If all men count with you, but none too muchIf you can fill the unforgiving minuteWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,And — which is more — you’ll be a Man, my son!This poem, which first appeared in a 1910 collection of Kipling’s verse, is the public’s favourite poem. It is couched as advice to ‘my son’ — presumably his only son, John.          Rudyard Kipling (pictured above) was a writer and Nobel LaureateA sad tale attaches to John. He was rejected as unfit during World War I. Kipling however, an ardent patriot, pulled strings to get John enlisted. The young man died at the Battle of Loos. But his son’s spirit and bravery continues to live on in the poem that has inspired millions.There is something about this particular poem that simply mesmerises people. They are transfixed, absorbed, transported, elevated. Kipling’s masterpiece is just right — not too long, not too short.And listeners, even if they can recall its actual words only dimly, have a real sense of its shape, the inevitability towards its magnificent ending.Sometimes I stop before those last six words and point to the person who has requested the poem. ‘You’ll be a man, my son,’ they say.They knew a thing or two, those Victorians. This poem deals with questions relevant to any age. And, unbelievably, the questions are not only asked, but answered in the space of four stanzas.Someone born in 1865 is able to speak to us right now and tell us exactly how to behave. No wonder tears come to people’s eyes.Invictus: The Unconquerable — by W.E. Henley          The poem Invictus: The Unconquerable, by W.E. Henley is said to have inspired Nelson Mandela (pictured above)Out of the night that covers me,Black as the pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.How this poem came to be written a tale worth telling. Henley had suffered from tuberculosis of the bone since childhood, and aged around 20 was forced to have his leg amputated below the knee.Later he developed an infection in the other leg and was told that this too, would have to come off. Henley sought a second opinion from the celebrated surgeon and antiseptic pioneer Joseph Lister, who operated to save the second leg.It was during these gruelling medical trials that Henley wrote his poem. Despite the horrors that await him, we learn, he is entirely unafraid.The doctors could whittle him down limb by limb and his soul would be untouched.No wonder this poem inspired Nelson Mandela in his prison on Robben Island, or that we now have the Invictus Games for injured service personnel.And so to Norwich city centre, where there are two girls aged about 16, with sad faces. The first asks for Invictus. ‘Very well,’ I say to them.‘But I need to go into Primark,’ says the second.‘No problem. I’ll go with you,’ I say.We walk into the shop, and I begin reciting as the girls stop by a display of plastic jewellery:‘Out of the night that covers me‘Black as the pit from pole to pole . . .’They are looking at the jewellery but also listening, especially the first. Despite her youth, it seems as if she might know something about ‘the pit’.By the end of the second quatrain the recitation has attracted the attention of a man in a shirt and tie who asks me to leave. ‘Just a minute,’ I say. ‘It’s nearly over.’‘I said outside.’ Suddenly I feel furious. The brave and fearless W.E. Henley would not have let himself be marched out of Primark. I’m damned if Henley is going to be stopped. I continue. ‘OK, Paul,’ the man says into his radio to an unknown person.‘He’s only reciting a poem,’ says the second girl, surprising me with her support.I finish, bow and walk off quickly, my hands up. As I near the exit, a second security guard is running towards me.I reach the door. ‘I’m going!’ I call out as I disappear into the street.Macavity The Mystery Cat — by T.S. Eliot          T.S Elliot (pictured above) penned the famous poem \u0027Macavity The Mystery Cat\u0027Macavity’s a Mystery Cat: he’s called the Hidden Paw —For he’s the master criminal who can defy the Law.He’s the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad’s despair:For when they reach the scene of crime — Macavity’s not there!Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,He’s broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,And when you reach the scene of crime — Macavity’s not there!You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air —But I tell you once and once again, Macavity’s not there!Macavity’s a ginger cat, he’s very tall and thinYou would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domedHis coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snakeAnd when you think he’s half asleep, he’s always wide awake.Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,For he’s a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square –But when a crime’s discovered, then Macavity’s not there!He’s outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard’s.And when the larder’s looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke’s been stifled,Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair —Ay, there’s the wonder of the thing! Macavity’s not there!And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty’s gone astray,Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair —But it’s useless to investigate —Macavity’s not there!And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:‘It must have been Macavity!’ — but he’s a mile away.You’ll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs,Or engaged in doing complicated long ision sums.Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare:At whatever time the deed took place — MACAVITY WASN’T THERE!And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known,(I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the timeJust controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime.          Thomas Stearns Eliot (pictured above) was a Poet And CriticOn a mild autumn evening, I was ambling past a restaurant. Outside it, a tall, sandy-haired man and two smart young boys were getting into a Rolls-Royce. ‘Good evening,’ I said to the man. ‘I don’t know if you’d be interested, but I’m a poetry performer. If you have a poem you like, I’ll try to recite it for you.’ The man looked at me with a certain degree of amusement. ‘I see,’ he said.‘And if you enjoy it, and only if, I offer my hat for any contribution you might care to make.’‘A poem I like?’ he said. ‘How about Macavity The Mystery Cat?’‘With pleasure.’‘Boys!’ he called into the car. ‘Come out! I want you to listen to this.’The boys, about eight and 10, clambered out of the car and stood obediently on the pavement.‘Macavity’s a Mystery Cat,’ I began quietly, looking into their eyes.T. S. Eliot wrote Macavity for his own godchildren it was later included in the 1939 collection Old Possum’s Book Of Practical Cats, which would later find immortality in the long-running stage musical Cats.I finished, and bowed. The owner of the Rolls-Royce took out his wallet, but then stopped. ‘Do you think you could do one more?’ he asked.In the front passenger seat of the car was an old woman. The man opened the driver’s side door and bent down.‘Mum,’ he said. ‘There’s a man here who can recite poems. Would you like to hear a poem?’The woman didn’t say anything.‘It’s OK,’ the man said. ‘Get in, you can sit next to her. I’ll go round and sit in the back.’Getting in, I closed the door behind me. The Rolls was very spacious, like a first-class seat on a train. The woman was frail, 85 years old, perhaps.‘Pleased to meet you,’ I said to the woman. She neither turned nor looked at me. The man spoke from behind her.‘We’re going to hear a poem,’ he said to her.She moved her head fractionally.‘It can be any poem you like,’ I said to her.Dead silence.‘It could be something you remember from school . . .’No response.‘I’ll try and remember it for you, and then I can recite . . .’‘Knocking on the moonlit door,’ she said, cutting me off.The relief was profound.‘Oh, that’s one of my favourites,’ I said. I wasn’t lying. She was referring to The Listeners by Walter de la Mare, written in about 1912. ‘Would you like to hear it?’No reply.‘I’ll try,’ I said. ‘And if you don’t like it, you can stop me. OK?’No reply.‘Is there anybody there . . .’ I began.But I had only got to ‘there’ when the woman turned to me, saying: ‘. . . said the Traveller’.Her grey eyes were unclouded, and as she spoke the words I could almost sense her falling back through decades.I waited for her to go on. She didn’t, so I continued. ‘Knocking on the moonlit door. And his horse in the silence champed the grasses of the forest’s ferny floor,’ I said.‘Floor,’ she echoed.As I went on, the woman’s lips moved a little, and there seemed to be a shadow of a smile on her face. The car was no longer a car. It was a clearing in a dark forest. I finished, and inclined my head in a brief bow. Then the woman did something unexpected. She reached for my hand. I held it. Her eyelids fluttered weakly. ‘Thank you,’ the man said, finally.‘Thank you for listening,’ I said to the woman. She let go of my hand.I got out of the car. The man got out too, and came over. He extracted a £50 note from his wallet, huge and red in the light from the restaurant window.‘That was wonderful,’ he said.‘Thank you,’ I replied, accepting the note with some disbelief. ‘That’s very generous. I promise to spend it wisely.’‘Spend it however you like,’ he said, putting his wallet away in his back pocket. ‘You’ve earned it.’He Wishes For The Cloths of Heaven — by W.B. YeatsHad I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,Enwrought with golden and silver light,The blue and the dim and the dark clothsOf night and light and the half-light,I would spread the cloths under your feet:But I, being poor, have only my dreamsI have spread my dreams under your feetTread softly because you tread on my dreams.Yeats is thought to have drawn on his own experience of courting the beautiful Anglo-Irish actress Maud Gonne, who refused several offers of marriage from him.          Yeats is thought to have drawn on his own experience of courting the beautiful Anglo-Irish actress Maud Gonne (pictured above)He never did manage to persuade her to become his wife.When I first went out on the street, I didn’t know this poem. But then I had a rather spiky response from a woman who had requested it. ‘Well, you’d better go off and learn it, then, hadn’t you?’ she said, making a little shooing gesture with her hand.So I learned it, and found it came in very handy. Lots of people asked for it, and it was always very well received.But I often wished I could meet the spiky woman again.There had been something unkind about the way she had dismissed me, something schoolmistressy she had really seemed to take pleasure in telling me what to do and where to go.I wanted another chance. But of course, life doesn’t work out like that.Except that sometimes it does. Months later, I did meet her again. She was with a group of about a dozen people walking through the city centre at around midnight one weekend.  William Butler Yeats (left and right) was a Irish poet and playwright‘Oh, the little poetry man,’ she said, recognising me. (I’m 5ft 11in.)Since meeting her I had had hundreds, thousands of encounters, but I knew her straight away: tall, slender, long blonde hair, handsome, but also a little lost-looking.‘How about some Yeats?’ I asked, joining the group and falling into step with her.          William Butler Yeats (pictured above) was also a prose writer‘You learned it for me? You remember me?’ she said, her eyes lighting up. I am afraid a demon entered me. I wanted to pay her back for her unkindness. I couldn’t be generous. ‘No,’ I said.The light died from her eyes. ‘Oh . . .’‘Yes, all right,’ I said, trying to make amends. ‘I do recognise you. I learned it for you. Do you want to hear it?’‘If you like.’ I recited it.One of her friends shouted as I finished: ‘That was very good!’ But she said nothing. She walked on, ignoring me.I had hurt her. The whole world felt sad.Pied Beauty — by Gerard Manley Hopkins          Gerard Manley Hopkins (pictured above) wrote the \u0027Pied Beauty\u0027 poemGlory be to God for dappled things —For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cowFor rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swimFresh-firecoal chestnut-falls finches’ wingsLandscape plotted and pieced — fold, fallow, and ploughAnd áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.All things counter, original, spare, strangeWhatever is fickle, freckled, (who knows how?)With swift, slow sweet, sour adazzle, dimHe fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:Praise him.The birthday party was in summertime: there was a big tent in the garden, and children were running around squealing excitedly in grass-stained clothing.The birthday girl was 30, and had invited her friends — artists, mainly — to celebrate with her.I had been hired for the day to mingle among the guests and recite poetry.They were a knowledgeable audience — no one said (as they so often did out on the streets: ‘I hate poetry,’ ‘Get a job,’ ‘I don’t carry change,’ ‘Do I look like I know anything about poetry?’, ‘Not interested,’ or ‘Spit some grime.’I struck up a conversation with a gentleman standing under a tree and nursing a glass of champagne. He said he was a lecturer in English And American Studies at the University of Sussex, and I vaguely recognised him.          During his time reciting poetry Gary Dexter struck up a conversation with a man who worked at the University of Sussex (pictured above)I told him I had been engaged by the hostess to recite poems, and he regarded me with scepticism.‘Which poems?’ he asked.‘Any poems you like,’ I replied.‘You can recite any poem I mention?’‘Yes,’ I said. Of course, it was untrue. English poetry is infinite.‘Julia,’ he said. ‘Come and listen to this.’ Julia came over with a friend. They were both very nice middle-class ladies. ‘This man’s going to recite a poem for us,’ said the lecturer. ‘Whatever we choose.’          Gerard Manley Hopkins (was an English poet)‘Oh, wooonderful,’ said one. ‘I love poetry. Can we have Marvell?’‘No,’ said the lecturer. ‘I’m choosing the poem. You can have Marvell later.’‘If you want to hear some Marvell, I’d be happy to . . .’ I said.But the lecturer cut me short. ‘What I want you to recite,’ he pronounced slowly, ‘is Pied Beauty by Gerard Manley Hopkins.’‘Very well,’ I said. I paused, then began:‘Glory be to God for dappled things . . .’I had practised the poem many, many times, and for good reason: Hopkins’s poetry is difficult, and requires plenty of concentration and dedication.This particular one, for example, written in 1877, is a ‘curtal sonnet’ — an invention of Hopkins, involving only ten-and-a-half lines, as opposed to the conventional 14.A challenge, certainly.I finished, and bowed, as I always did. The lecturer in English And American Studies turned to me.‘That,’ he said, ‘was the second-best rendition of that poem I have ever heard.’A remark I have been wondering about ever since. Gary Dexter\u0027s health improved and he has returned to his work as a writer and musician, and now a reciter of poetry.Adapeted from The People’s Favourite Poems by Gary Dexter (Old Street, £12.99). © Gary Dexter 2019.

She had told Patrick that she has been recently seeing Jeff Bezos,\u0027 an unnamed source told Page Six.              Lauren Sanchez is seen in 2012 at the Pussycat Dolls Burlesque Saloon in Las Vegas. The former TV anchor is now a helicopter pilot who owns a company that shoots aerial video          Sanchez is seen with her husband Patrick Whitesell in 2012.

Both Howard and Pecker were granted witness immunity in exchange for testifying in the case. Bezos, 54, shared the announcement on his personal Twitter account shortly after 9am Eastern on Wednesday, signed by both him and MacKenzie. \u0027As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to orce and continue our shared lives as friends,\u0027 the statement read. \u0027If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again.\u0027  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and novelist MacKenzie Bezos announced they are orcing, through a joint statement on Wednesday, after 25 years of marriage. They are shown at left  in 2003, and are pictured at right the 2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills, California in March  \u0027As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to orce and continue our shared lives as friends,\u0027 the statement posted to Jeff\u0027s Twitter account on Wednesday read. \u0027If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it again\u0027Jeff Bezos is worth close to $140 billion. The statement did not mention how the two will split that fortune, though experts believed that\u0027s already been hashed out.Much of that dollar amount comes from his 16 percent ownership stake in Amazon, which briefly became the second US-based company to reach a $1 trillion valuation in September, behind Apple in August.  Amazon\u0027s stock edged up $2.84 on Wednesday to close at $1,659.42. That left Amazon with a market value of $811 billion, more than any other publicly traded company in the US. The company passed Microsoft this week to become the world\u0027s biggest publicly traded company by market capitalization.The orce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Thomas Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson \u0026amp Co.Amazon Vice President of Corporate Communications Drew Herdener told DailyMail.com in a statement: \u0027Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon.\u0027Two-time author MacKenzie Bezos, 48, who won an American Book Award in 2006, was one of the first employees of Amazon at its founding, doing accounting for the start-up.          Jeff and MacKenzie are pictured in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 12, 2003. She was one of the first employees of Amazon at its founding, doing accounting for the start-up          Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos married in 1993, one year before he founded Amazon, which he started from a garage in Seattle in 1994. Jeff is pictured with stacks of books in 1997The two, who both graduated from Princeton University six years apart, live in Washington, which is a community property state, and that means all assets acquired during the marriage by either spouse are split equally unless there\u0027s a prenuptial agreement stating otherwise.The ision of the Bezos\u0027 assets will be complicated because the two will continue to pursue joint ventures, according to the joint statement.  \u0027We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other,\u0027 the statement read.  \u0027We\u0027ve had such a great life together as a married couple, and we also see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as iniduals pursuing ventures and adventures.\u0027Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends.\u0027 Toby Yerburgh, Partner and Head of Family at Collyer Bristow LLP, told DailyMail.com: \u0027Not since the \u0027conscious uncoupling\u0027 statement of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin have a high profile couple released such a positive and upbeat statement announcing their orce as the one released today by Jeff Bezos and his wife. \u0027Such agreed statements often form part of the negotiations over a financial split and come attached to an NDA. They demonstrate the importance of high profile orcing couples\u0027 lawyers working hand in glove with their PR agents.\u0027          Jeff Bezos is worth close to $140 billion. The statement did not mention how the two will split that fortune. Jeff (right) is pictured attending the Amazon Prime Video\u0027s Golden Globe Awards After Party at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 6 in Beverly Hills, California with Mr. Robot series creator Sam Esmail (left), head of Amazon Studios Jennifer Salke (second from left), and the star of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Rachel Brosnahan (second from right)The bulk of the assets now at issue in this financial split include nearly 79 million shares of Amazon stock, which is currently worth about $130 billion, along with Rocket ship maker Blue Origin and The Washington Post.According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly. Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.\u0027They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the orce.\u0027Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff  to buy out his wife or for MacKenzie  to retain shares.\u0027If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,\u0027 she said.It is unlikely that many details of the orce will become public, New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who is representing Judith Giuliani in her orce from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said.\u0027These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,\u0027 Clair said.    Less than two years ago, Jeff and MacKenzie couldn\u0027t keep their hands off of each other as they vacationed in Italy in May of 2017Less than two years ago, the two couldn\u0027t keep their hands off of each other as they vacationed in Italy in May of 2017.And now, on Sunday night, Jeff was all smiles while at the Golden Globe Awards, hobnobbing with celebrities without MacKenzie by his side. Amazon Prime Video\u0027 hosted its own after party at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 6 in Beverly Hills, where he was photographed with Mr. Robot series creator Sam Esmail, head of Amazon Studios Jennifer Salke, and the star of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Rachel Brosnahan.Jeff came up from virtually nothing to become the self-made billionaire, one hundred times over, that he is today. He was born to a 16-year-old mother, Jacklyn Gise, and deadbeat dad, Ted Jorgensen, in Texas on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen.When Jeff was 17 months old, his mom orced Jorgensen, who belonged to a unicycle troupe and was making $1.25 per hour at a retail store, according to CNBC.About three years later, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos in 1968.  Miguel had arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba, and he only knew one word of English: \u0027hamburger.\u0027When Jeff was four, Jorgensen agreed to allow Miguel to adopt his son, and that\u0027s how Jeff became became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.           \u0027Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends,\u0027 the statement read. Jeff (second from right) and MacKenzie Bezos (third from left) are pictured with their three sons, the oldest of which is Preston, 18 (second from left), and their adopted daughter from China (third from right), attending the premiere of Paramount Pictures\u0027 \u0027Star Trek Beyond\u0027 at Embarcadero Marina Park South on July 20, 2016 in San Diego, CaliforniaMacKenzie was born MacKenzie S. Tuttle on April 7, 1970, in San Francisco, California. Her father was a financial planner father and she had a stay-at-home mom.By high school, she had moved east, and graduated from Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1988. MacKenzie went on to graduate from Princeton University with a bachelor\u0027s degree in English, with highest honors in 1992.She studied under Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison while in college, who said she was \u0027one of the best students I\u0027ve ever had in my creative writing classes.\u0027Morrison, who was MacKenzie\u0027s thesis adviser, was the one who connected her with famed literary agent Amanda \u0027Binky\u0027 Urban. Jeff also graduated from Princeton, but in 1986, and the two never crossed paths while studying there. Jeff and MacKenzie met at work in New York City in 1992. Jeff was the first to interview MacKenzie at the  investment management firm of DE Shaw. At the time, Jeff was a vice president there, and MacKenzie had come on board as a research associate, Business Insider reported.The two Princeton graduates were engaged three months later and married in 1993. Transformation: When Bezos\u0027 net worth reached $105.1 billion in January of 2018, CNN reported that he was the richest person in history. Jeff is shown at left during a press conference on August 23, 2000, and at right during the Allen \u0026amp Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 13, 2017That was all before Jeff founded Amazon, which he started from a garage in Seattle in 1994. Since that time, the two have made a noticeable style transformation.Portraits of the Amazon CEO that were taken in 1997 — the year his company went public — show him wearing a blue button-down shirt, pleated khaki pants, and a black leather wrist watch while posing next to stacks of books. Fast forward to 2017, and Jeff set the internet alight when he showed up to the annual Allen \u0026amp Company Sun Valley conference with bulging muscles peeking out from his polo shirt.With his shaved head and tinted sunglasses — plus the bulging biceps — many on Twitter couldn\u0027t help but compare the Amazon CEO to action star Vin Diesel.Gone were Jeff\u0027s baggy shirts and receding hairline and there, among the richest and most influential people in the world, he seemed to emerge reborn.MacKenzie, meanwhile, went from frumpy separates to sleek, form-fitting sheath dresses that she often accessorizes with a pair of classic pumps. The two were most-recently seen attending Senator John McCain\u0027s funeral in early September. Jeff was wearing a classic black suit with a blue tie, while MacKenzie wore a long-sleeve black sheath and matching heels.           Jeff and MacKenzie were most-recently seen attending Senator John McCain\u0027s funeral in early September in Washington, DC. Jeff was wearing a classic black suit with a blue tie, while MacKenzie wore a long-sleeve black sheath and matching heelsSpeaking of their early years at an event in Berlin in April, Jeff said MacKenzie\u0027s support was instrumental when he founded Amazon, and that she did the accounting for the company in its first year.\u0027When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,\u0027 he said at the event.Now, if the two file for orce in their home state of Washington, their assets may be subject to the community property state\u0027s laws of ision.In Washington, all income earned and property acquired by either spouse during a marriage is owned by both spouses, together, and will be split equally upon orce, unless that default rule is opted out of with a prenuptial agreement.  But since the duo\u0027s fortune was amassed after they met, it\u0027s highly likely they didn\u0027t draft a pre-nup before they wed.  Jeff\u0027s wealth has grown exponentially in the last five years, with Forbes estimating his net worth at $32 billion in March of 2014. When his net worth reached $105.1 billion in January of 2018, CNN reported that Jeff was the richest person in history. Now, he\u0027s worth $136.9 billion, and he and MacKenzie are thought to own more land, together, than almost anyone else in the United States of America, according to Business Insider. If his $137 billion fortune is split equally with MacKenzie, it would mean Jeff would lose the title as world\u0027s richest person, and MacKenzie would gain the title of world\u0027s richest woman.But even with a $69 billion fortune, the Amazon founder would still be ranked fifth richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. The two, who have been known to live relatively modestly despite the monumental wealth they\u0027ve acquired in recent years, reportedly lived in a one-bedroom rented home in Seattle through 1999. To date, they now own at least five homes throughout the country.          Community property is the default rule in Washington, which means all assets acquired by either spouse during a marriage are split equally in orce, but that can be opted out of with a prenuptial agreement. Jeff and MacKenzie own two homes in Medina, an exclusive Seattle suburb, an aerial view of which is shown. They paid $10 million for the property in 1998On the west coast, they own two homes in Medina, Washington, an exclusive Seattle suburb that is also home to Bill Gates.They paid $10 million for 5.3 acres of property in 1998, according to the Wall Street Journal.One of the homes covers 20,600 square feet with five bedrooms and five bathrooms. The other is 8,300 square feet with five bedrooms and five bathrooms. The latter is rumored to have cost $53 million.The estate with 310 feet of Lake Washington shoreline underwent a $28 million renovation in 2010.          Bezos\u0027 beautiful original Mediterranean-style home (pictured), located on North Alpine Drive, was purchased back in 2007 for $24.45 million          Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos broadened his Beverly Hills abode by acquiring a neighbor\u0027s off-market property for $12.9 million          This aerial shot shows the entire Bezos compound in a ritzy neighborhood of Beverly Hills          To date, the two own five homes throughout the country, including this second house shown in Beverly Hills which was acquired off-market from a neighbor for $12.9 millionIn Beverly Hills, the two added on to an original purchase in Southern California from 2007 that cost them $24.45 million by buying an adjacent home in an off-market sale from a neighbor for $12.9 million in 2017. The first home is a seven-bed, seven-bath Spanish-style mansion with a greenhouse, tennis court, swimming pool, six car garage and four fountains.Neighbors reportedly include A-listers Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Walter Matthau.The second home is far more modest at just 4,568 square feet with four bedrooms.          The majority of the duo\u0027s land holdings are in West Texas, where the family owns an estimated 400,000 acres in Culberson and Hudspeth counties east of El Paso. One of the holdings is a 30,000-acre Figure 2 ranch outside of Van Horn (pictured in an aerial view)           Figure 2 is also the home base of Jeff Bezos\u0027 space exploration company Blue Origin, which was incorporated in 2001The majority of Jeff and MacKenzie\u0027s land holdings are in West Texas, where the clan owns an estimated 400,000 acres in Culberson and Hudspeth counties, east of El Paso.Most of the Texas land was purchased using limited-liability companies named for famous explorers, according to the Wall Street Journal.It includes the family\u0027s 30,000-acre Figure 2 ranch outside of Van Horn, which serves as a reminder of the summers Jeff spent on his grandparents\u0027 ranch growing up.Figure 2 serves as the home base for Jeff\u0027s private space company Blue Origin, which was founded in 2001.A portion of the duo\u0027s net worth comes from Blue Origin, which is valued at somewhere between $1 billion and $28 billion.It is difficult to determine the specific value of the company because of the lack of details available about the enterprise, and the fact that Jeff is the sole shareholder, Chad Anderson, CEO of venture fund Space Angels, told Bloomberg.Jeff said in April 2017 that he funds Blue Origin through the sale of \u0027about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock\u0027.

The paper is included in his estimated net worth.          The two bought three condos in the Century building at 25 Central Park West (pictured) in New York City\u0027s Upper West Side in 1999 under an LLC called \u0027Jetima\u0027          The purchase of the New York City home in the building pictured was from former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola for $7.65 millionAnd in Manhattan, the two bought three condos in the Century building at 25 Central Park West in New York City\u0027s Upper West Side in 1999 under an LLC called \u0027Jetima.\u0027 The purchase was from former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola for $7.65 million. Jeff and MacKenzie share four children, including three sons and a daughter, who they adopted from China.  Their oldest child, Preston, turned 18 in March.MacKenzie is the author of \u0027The Testing of Luther Albright,\u0027 a psychological novel about the challenges facing a Sacramento, California father and his family after an earthquake, which won her the American Book Award in 2006.In 2014 she launched Bystander Revolution, an anti-bullying organization.In September, Jeff committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities.

Meghan\u0027s first four patronages represent a key step for the duchess, who is still in her first year as a newbie royal.According to the royal family\u0027s website: \u0027Royal patronages add status to an organisation, and visits and involvement from a royal patron can often bring much-needed publicity.\u0027Meghan will have been inundated with requests from charities asking for her support since marrying the Duke of Sussex in May. Members of the royal family each receive hundreds of pleas each year.Most royals tends to limit their patronages to a manageable number to allow them to devote enough time to each.The Duchess of Cambridge has 17 and has focused on early intervention for children.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have more than 1,000 patronages between them, many of which were inherited from previous monarchs.According to he royal family\u0027s website, the most influential member regarding patronages is still the Queen.\u0027The Queen\u0027s patronage carries the most weight, and Her Majesty receives the most requests for patronages of all the members of the royal family,\u0027 the site says.          Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charitiesIn 2016, following her 90th birthday, the Queen stepped down from 25 patronages, including the NSPCC, which was taken over by the Countess of Wessex, and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, which went to Kate.          The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700sNow she has handed two over to Meghan, with the duchess becoming patron of the National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.But the monarch - the nation\u0027s longest reigning sovereign - still has 599 patronages or associations. Philip stepped down as patron or president of more than a dozen organisations when he turned 90 in 2010.He was patron, president or a member of 785 organisations at his retirement in 2017, and continues his association with them behind the scenes.Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charities.She resigned her position as patron or president from all but six - Centrepoint, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, the National Aids Trust, London\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children and the Royal Marsden Hospital.Those she stepped down from included Help the Aged, Barnardos, Relate and the Parkinson\u0027s Disease Society.The princess - William and Harry\u0027s mother who died in a car crash in 1997 - said she made her decision \u0027with great sadness\u0027, but wanted to concentrate her efforts on fewer causes.The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700s.The organisation was concerned with architectural and art history, conservation and heraldry.It still exists today and and the Queen\u0027s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, is its patron.Patronages generally reflect a royal\u0027s interests, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, who is president of the National Osteoporosis Society after both her mother and grandmother died due to the brittle bone disease."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/10/09/175E475B00000514-6576639-image-a-49_1547112595331.jpg","title":"Hes Tru talent Afghan talent singers uncanny resemblance Canadas Justin Trudeau","story":"Abdul Salam Maftoon (left), a contestant on an Afghan talent show has become a star thanks to his uncanny resemblance to Canada\u0027s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (right)  Singer Abdul Salam Maftoon (left) has been competing in Afghan Star, which claims to be Afghanistan\u0027s number one \u0027music talent programme\u0027.

The winner is decided each year by the members of the Swedish Academy, with their deliberations kept secret for 50 years. Just-released documents from 1968 show the committee’s chairman, Anders Österling, writing that “regarding Samuel Beckett, unfortunately, I have to maintain my basic doubts as to whether a prize to him is consistent with the spirit of Nobel’s will”.“Of course, I do not dispute the artistic effect of Beckett’s dramas, but misanthropic satire (of the Swift type) or radical pessimism (of the Leopardi type) has a powerful heart, which in my opinion is lacking in Beckett,” wrote Österling. He had previously slammed the possibility of the Waiting for Godot author winning the Nobel in 1964, when he said that he “would almost consider a Nobel prize for him as an absurdity in his own style”.Beckett had been a popular choice with other committee members in 1968, who praised “the human compassion that inspires his work”. Other leading contenders for the prize that year included French novelist André Malraux, British poet WH Auden and Japanese novelist Yasunari Kawabata.Other names put forward for the world’s top literature prize in 1968 included Ezra Pound and EM Forster – both dismissed on account of their advancing ages – Chinua Achebe, Charles de Gaulle and Graham Greene. Vladimir Nabokov was again set aside by a jury that had previously described his novel Lolita as immoral, and was not inclined to change its mind Eugène Ionesco was considered, and hailed for the novelty he had brought to modern drama, but dismissed because of the controversial nature of his work.Australian author Patrick White, who would win the Nobel five years later, was already emerging in 1968 as a serious contender. The committee praised his “great novel” The Tree of Man, saying that White could be the “fifth continent’s first full-time representative in literature”.Österling pushed for the choice of Malraux, despite the author’s position as minister of culture in De Gaulle’s government, but added that a prize for Kawabata “should prove justified and welcome”, as would one for Auden, even though “the groundbreaking stage of his poetry is now a while ago”.Kawabata would go on to emerge triumphant, praised by the jury “for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind”.Beckett, despite Österling’s previous reservations, would win the next year, “for his writing, which – in new forms for the novel and drama – in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation”. Auden, Malraux, Achebe, Pound, De Gaulle, Greene and Forster never won.The 50-year embargo on the documents revealing the jury members’ thoughts means that Nobel watchers will have to wait until 2066 to read the negotiations that went on before Bob Dylan was named as the 2016 Nobel laureate, “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”, a choice which was praised in some quarters and reviled in others.The archives for 2018, however, are likely to be less illuminating in 2068: the Nobel prize for literature was withheld last year after the Swedish Academy was hit by scandal. Jean-Claude Arnault, husband of academy member Katarina Frostenson, was accused of sexual assault, later convicted of rape and sentenced to prison in October. A wave of resignations in the academy over its handling of the allegations followed, and it was subsequently decided to postpone the prize for a year “in view of … reduced public confidence”.The Nobel Foundation, which funds the prize, has said that it hopes the academy will become more transparent, with executive director Lars Heikensten saying: “The academy has cultivated a closed culture over a long period of time. This was likely to be challenged at one time or another.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53adbc1a6911f1758f6b3dbe643599aec15b26b1/0_376_1581_948/master/1581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c4a18edc76807a66a5cd728c46293f1","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last two weeks, just a small selection from the bumper crop of end of year lists that you’ve posted over the holiday period. The breadth and depth of reading on display has been most impressive. Plenty of wisdom has also been garnered from those books, as Rick2016 demonstrates:Of the 45 books I read this year (which most people think is a lot but pales in comparison to many of the people in this forest!), the standouts were the following (roughly in order):Vikram Seth - A Suitable BoyRichard Powers - The OverstoryDavid Park - Travelling in a Strange LandGraham Greene - The Quiet AmericanMargaret Atwood - The Handmaid’s TaleJL Carr - A Month in the CountryJohn le Carré - The Spy Who Came in from the ColdSomerset Maugham - Of Human BondageLima Barreto - The Sad End of Policarpo QuaresmaEdward St Aubyn - Never MindTatiana Salem Levy - The House at SmyrnaPenelope Lively - Moon TigerLooking at my reading this year, I learned three things:1. It’s good to make the time to read those long novels that I keep meaning to read. Some, like A Suitable Boy would have been worth it if they had been twice as long.2. Having a perception of an author’s style through hearsay, or even reading only one of their books, isn’t the same as actually reading them properly. Greene, le Carré, Atwood, Dickens and others turned out to be far richer experiences than I expected.3. TLS is an absolute goldmine for recommendations. I knew that already but there are several books that I loved this year that I would never have read if it weren’t for you folks’ advocacy. So thank you so much.Here’s another 2018 summary, from interwar:Putting together my annual list was a great reminder of so many hours well spent. My 20 ‘most rewarding reads’ of 2018 include fiction only, and I’m well aware that some of my choices directly contradict others’ judgements. Note that by ‘most rewarding’ I don’t necessarily mean most enjoyable. Mostly these were books that made me think and stretched my imagination.Four were re-reads:Wilkie Collins, The MoonstoneE M Forster, A Passage to IndiaR K Narayan, The World of NagarajOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayTen were translations:Shusako Endo, VolcanoWolfgang Hilbig, Old Rendering PlantIsmaiil Kadare, The Traitor’s NicheWalter Kempowski, HomelandLaszlo Krasznahorkai, The World Goes OnAyiyujo Nosaka, The Cake Tree in the RuinsOrhan Pamuk, SnowAhmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in BaghdadJose Saramago, The Elephant’s JourneyMario Vargas Llosa, The StorytellerAnd the rest:Elizabeth Bowen, The Last SeptemberRoland Camberton, Rain on the PavementsGabriel Jiosipovicii, The Cemetery in BarnesPhilip Larkin, A Girl in WinterWilliam Maxwell, The Folded LeafAlex Pheby, LuciaI could have included dozens more lists of similar quality – although. it should also be said that plenty of contributors didn’t catalogue their reading or didn’t read quite such vast numbers of books. One of the great things about TLS is that it takes all sorts – and all are welcome. On that note, I also enjoyed these spy and crime recommendations from beerbart:I got the Xmas present that I wanted, the latest Ben Macintyre The Spy and The Traitor. My love for his work can only continue as this is another top class non-fiction thriller brimming with interesting facts from the late Cold War. However, being hardback, it is far too big on my commute. So I have a Maigret mystery in the bag, Maigret and the Minister which I’m rifling through. I mainly read these for the unique atmosphere Simenon invokes. I also have another part of Deighton’s Samson series on the go via Audio. Spy Hook. I’m not yet in love with this series but I’m too invested in the characters to drop out.Meanwhile, dothebathosphere has already finished their book of 2019: The Faint-hearted Bolshevik by Lorenzo Silva:It’s a “punk” book, the first sentence has the narrator describing his soul being located in his nether regions and it pretty much stays in that register. The narrator seeks revenge on a woman who he ran into the back of at a traffic light. He starts with prank calls and stalking but then sets eyes on the woman’s 15-year-old sister, revenge is off the table the narrator sets his mind to being a “child abuser”. (I use quotes only because he has second thoughts in the course of his lechery before he’s tried anything physical).Well, the book is both repellent and very funny. It’s a cult hit in Spain and astonishingly often recommended to pupils as secondary school reading.Ellie Rose has also just “devoured” Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman:I started reading it on the train, walked around my house reading it, made dinner reading it (the meal suffered slightly, I must admit) and finally finished it about 9pm, feeling like I’d taken a punch to the gut. I found it unbearably sad, but darkly funny too, and sweet and overall very human. As a first read for 2019, it augurs good things for the year, I think!Finally, a challenge from vermontlogger following a “re-re-reading” of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations:I thought I would just read the first chapter or two. Then of course there was no stopping. No matter how well we know the story, Dickens’ writing is irresistibly vivid and inventive – and is there any other book that can make you laugh and tear up on the same page?I can think of a few government policy documents that have made me feel that way, but that’s maybe not the same thing.

JLR’s sweeping job cuts follow a double-whammy of problems, with Brexit uncertainty adding an extra garnish.JLR is also vulnerable to the slowdown in China. Donald Trump’s trade war has hurt the Chinese economy - yesterday we learned that car sales in China fell in 2018, for the first time in at least two decades. Economists fear a ‘hard landing’ in China that could crush consumer demand, and send ripples through the global economy.Plus there’s uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the EU. UK car sales also fell last year, for the second year running. Today’s disappointing Christmas trading figures from John Lewis and Marks \u0026amp Spencer have highlighted that shoppers are being cautious. Plus the car industry is very dependant on ‘just-in-time’ supply chains, which would be hurt by trade friction at the UK border.Here’s the details of JLR’s new investment in electric car technology, announced alongside its job cuts plan.Later this year, next-generation Electric Drive Units (EDU) will be produced at the company’s Engine Manufacturing Centre in Wolverhampton. These EDUs will be powered by batteries assembled at a new Jaguar Land Rover Battery Assembly Centre located at Hams Hall, North Warwickshire, reinforcing the company’s commitment to the West Midlands and the UK.“The Battery Assembly Centre will be one of the largest of its kind in the UK, using new production techniques and technologies to manufacture battery packs for future Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles.JLK is planning to begin a voluntary redundancy programme in the UK, to remove layers of management.“This strategic review will create a leaner, more resilient organisation with a flatter management structure.”CEO Ralf Speth has also promised that JLR will deliver “a future range of British-built electric vehicles”.Many of JLR’s UK job cuts will affect management roles, including at its sites in Coventry and Gaydon, Warwickshire.BREAKING: Jaguar Land Rover have confirmed that they, like Ford, are cutting jobs...and the axe will fall heavily on the UK.JLR plans to cut around 4,500 roles around the globe, as part of a major cost-cutting programme designed to save £2.5bn.JLR says it is responding to “multiple” geopolitical and regulatory disruptions (eg China’s slowing economy), and to the technology changes facing the sector (such as the move to electric and self-driving cars).“We are taking decisive action to help deliver long-term growth in the face of multiple geopolitical and regulatory disruptions as well as technology challenges facing the automotive industry.”JLR, which employs about 40,000 people in Britain, has also announced a new battery assembly centre at Hams Hall near Birmingham, and will begin producing electric drive units at its Wolverhampton engine plant.The looming job cuts at Jaguar Land Rover have been raised over at parliament.Theresa May’s spokesman has told reporters that JLR sees the UK as “home”, and is committed to the country, saying:“JLR have been very clear that they regard the UK as home and are investing in the future to develop the next generation of vehicles.We will continue to work closely with the company to support their long-term plans.That doesn’t rule out some layoffs, though....Ford has also warned that the European market is tough - persistently so - meaning sweeping changes are needed.The FT’s Peter Campbell has the details:Ford is holding a conference call with journalists now.On it, European chief Steven Armstrong has warned that further job cuts might be needed if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.Economist Andrew Sentance says the job cuts at Ford and JLR are part of a broader trend towards automation:In other blow to Europe’s auto sector, Jaguar Land Rover is set to announce heavy job losses too.A source familiar with the plans has told us the redundancies were likely to affect “white-collar” workers the most, with the majority of UK job reductions achieved via voluntary redundancies.Here are more details of Ford’s cost-cutting plans -- including likely job losses in the UK:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e4ef018a131d77b375eb8609c5868eeba845ca4/3030_358_2560_1537/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00ff9babf61565e2719cf08ee245129d","title":"free bikes to steering wheel spikes ways to boost urban cycling","story":"Car-free days, filtered permeability and lower speed limits are just some of the ways that cities around the world are trying to encourage cyclingIf the benefits of cycling – both economic and environmental – outweigh the cost of bikes overall, then why not simply give bikes away?Like most cycling initiatives, this idea can be traced to the Netherlands, where the anarchist group Provo distributed 10,000 white bikes to the city of Amsterdam in the 1960s.Variations have since cropped up round the world. In Adelaide, free daily hire bikes are available to visitors and residents as part of the Australian city’s Smart Move strategy. Birmingham in the UK ran a scheme last year where residents of poorer postcodes could apply for a free bike if they agreed to ride it. Meanwhile, in Gothenburg, Sweden, the government is giving free bikes to commuters who promise to drive less.In 1977, Groningen – a small city in the northern Netherlands – underwent a rapid transformation. Provisional signs and barriers were covertly erected to direct cars out of the city centre until they were gradually, over several months, confined to areas outside it.By selectively reducing the number of city streets available to vehicles, journeys that were once relatively easy by car became arduous and convoluted. Residents chose to cycle instead of drive, even when heading to a big furniture and homewares store such as Ikea – whose specially designed cargo bikes are popular with locals.The idea, later termed “filtered permeability” by transport planning professor Steve Melia, applied in a single stroke what he calls the three most important principles for increasing urban cycling: separation from motor traffic, consistent design, and making bike journeys quicker and more convenient than car journeys.Excluding cars entirely isn’t always practical – and can make life difficult for disabled people, as well as preventing access for ambulances, fire services and delivery lorries.Slowing cars down makes city centres more hospitable to cyclists – but does putting up 20mph or 30kph speed signs actually have an effect?But a November report from the Department for Transport concluded that, over 12 schemes across Britain, 20mph zones have achieved on average a less than 1mph reduction in median speed.Urban designer and transport planner John Dales suggests that, regardless of signposting, “designing the street, as a whole, to achieve the desired speed is the key thing”. The more successful low-speed areas include physical designs which make it natural for drivers to go slower. These include humps, speed tables, rough surfaces, tight corners and carriageway narrowing lanes.What if legislation alone could encourage more people to cycle?In the Netherlands, liability is automatically placed with the more powerful road user, unless it can be proven they were not at fault. The law is designed to protect vulnerable road users from financial damage caused by drivers of motorised vehicles. Unlike in the UK, a motorist who hits a cyclist in the Netherlands must prove they were doing everything they could to avoid contact – otherwise they will be liable for damages.Supporters say stacking the law in this way would encourage people to drive more carefully.One way to get around this could be by teaching drivers to use the “Dutch reach”, a term actually coined by an American cyclist Michael Charney. By opening a car door with the hand furthest from the handle, the driver is forced to turn their body towards the door, becoming more likely to catch sight of approaching cyclists in their peripheral vision.One study in Chicago found that about one-in-five bicycle accidents involve car doors, with many happening as cyclists swerve to avoid collision. Even in Vancouver – another city with a notable cycle lane network – “dooring” is the most common cause of injury for cyclists colliding with cars.In the UK, where “dooring” is responsible for an average of 700 injuries and two deaths every year, the government announced in October that Dutch reach will be added to the highway code. Traffic safety organisations like the AAA will begin teaching it to US drivers from January.According to American professor Donald Shoup, car driving is subsidised greatly by the general public. When parking spaces are provided free of charge to the motorist, their cost is absorbed into the cost of other things – be that supermarket prices, company fees, or taxes.In his ground-breaking 2005 book The High Cost of Free Parking – and his latest tome, Parking and the City, published this year – Shoup argues that these economic subsidies pull people into cars, to the cost of everyone else.In California, Shoup managed to get a new state law requiring employers who provide subsidised parking for their employees to also offer a cash allowance in lieu of a parking space – so taking the fringe benefit of free parking and transforming it into an incentive for cycling.Although, so far only one workplace has actually implemented the “parking cash out”. At the Sony studio in Santa Monica, cyclist Gary Kavanagh discovered this idea independently of Shoup, and pitched it to his HR department only to find it was unenforced state law. Soon enough, his cycle commuting made him $120 richer each month. He chronicled the experience in his blog.“It didn’t take long for this kind of incentive to start influencing behaviour,” he writes. “Some part-time bike commuters who would occasionally drive became full-time bike commuters. Some people who never rode bikes before suddenly embraced it full swing, and would come to my desk to ask bicycle questions.”Can banning cars from part of a city for just for one day help lead to long-term change? Supporters say it gives people a taste of what the city could be like in a less car-dominated future.Many think that car-free Sundays in the Netherlands in the 1970s were pivotal to the country’s transformation in the following decades. Since then cities around the world have tried their own version, with congested Asian cities such as Chengdu and Jakarta even roping off a few streets.Paris has been leading the way in Europe, with the almost five-mile distance between the Arc de Triomphe and the Place de la Nation closed to car traffic once a year, which is soon to be increased to once a month.London does not have a large-scale car-free day but one Sunday in September the city’s boroughs agree to the closure of 50 inidual streets. The London car-free day campaign is pushing mayor Sadiq Khan for more.In a new twist on park and ride, some cities – such as Oxford, York and Cambridge – are offering park and pedal schemes which provide free parking for vehicles outside the city as an incentive to hop on a bike and cycle into the centre.There are two of these “bicycle interchanges” a mile outside Oxford, where cyclists can leave bikes at Redbridge or Seacourt park before catching a bus, or park their car at the site and ride into the city centre.In Seville, the Bus\u0026ampBici scheme entitles resident commuters to free bike rental for the last leg of their journey – as long as they return it by midnight.Some countries operate cycle-to-work schemes – with tax exemptions on bike purchases – but this can be taken to the next level by directly paying people to get on their bikes.Governments in several European states have experimented with the idea. The Netherlands trialled a scheme in 2018 allowing companies to pay employees 19 cents for every kilometre they cycle to and from work. Congested Milan is also contemplating a similar programme and, on a smaller scale, one company in Christchurch, New Zealand, pays employees an extra $5 a day if they cycle to and from work.Paying people to cycle could even be profitable for a city. Elly Blue’s book Bikenomics explores the economic benefits of cycling and finds that cities benefit from reduced congestion, while businesses benefit from reduced sick leave and improved employee satisfaction.One trial in France, though, showed that a monetary incentive only attracted a certain type of commuter – with most of the rise in cycle commuting coming not from former drivers, but from dissolved carpooling arrangements.Studies have shown that injuries to pedestrians increased when seatbelt laws were introduced in Australia in the early 1970s. The argument goes that as drivers’ sense of safety grew, they became more likely to take risks, and subconsciously drove a little faster or a bit more recklessly. While the legislation had made those inside the cars safer, it had shifted the risk on to other road users – particularly cyclists and pedestrians.American economist Gordon Tullock proposed one novel way of getting around this. He suggested that more lives would be saved if the government ordered sharp spikes to be installed on all steering wheels, leaving drivers perpetually poised on the edge of serious injury.His idea was built on by several others, including economist Sandy Ikeda, who suggested that the best possible safety measure would be to “ban brakes on cars”.But both were proposed strictly as a thought experiment …What other ways can help promote urban cycling?

I had this unsolvable problem outside of our house, and 100 yards away in my studio I have this passion for an art form that is so durable.”Wearing a high-vis jacket and armed with traffic cones, Bachor has so far created 79 installations around the world including in New York and Helsinki. He creates the mosaics in his studio, fixing the artwork on a cheesecloth. Bachor then prepares the concrete on site and carefully sets the mosaic in the road. It takes about two hours, and he’s back the next day when the concrete is set to scrub off the excess.His requirements are specific – he even sent a pothole scout out in New York to find the right ones. The pothole can’t be in the centre of the street, it needs to be a road in a relatively good condition, and it must be a rough size of 18 to 24 inches, and a couple of inches deep.He doesn’t know the legalities of filling in potholes without permission, and his New York installations were removed by the city’s transport department.His work seems to cause less trouble in his hometown.“There was one time on south side of Chicago. This cop gets out and walks up to me and says, ‘Are you that pothole guy?’“‘Yeah,’ I said.“He goes, ‘That is so fucking cool.’”Find more of Jim Bachor’s art on his website.

The House of Commons Speaker has at times a comic degree of self-esteem that is the equal of the arrogant steward in Twelfth Night. Like Malvolio, Bercow can also drive colleagues to distraction, as he did today. Today, though, Bercow took a brave stand to empower Britain’s parliament against Britain’s government on Brexit. And that qualifies him to be considered the most radical holder of his office in generations. Like Malvolio, a version of greatness has been thrust upon him.The vast majority of people are understandably not well versed in Commons procedure. So it may seem strange to claim that a decision to allow an amendment to be moved on a Commons timetable motion – and with no debate – is in any way immense. Nevertheless, Bercow’s decision to allow the all-party effort, led by the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, to tie the government’s hands – it must come back with a plan B within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated next week – deserves such accolades.The 11-vote victory for Grieve’s amendment may be pivotal in the Brexit endgame. Coming on top of Tuesday’s seven-vote government defeat on the Yvette Cooper no-deal motion, it is confirmation that Theresa May does not have a majority for her Brexit deal. The path lies open – though the intervening ground remains treacherous – towards either a softer “Norway plus” relationship, or a second referendum that may lead to Britain remaining in the EU after all.None of this would have happened, or even be a possibility, under a more deferential Speaker than Bercow. And it only happened because he has consciously put himself in the front line, over the most important issue of our time, in a long battle to strengthen the power of parliament against ministers. The Speaker may have come to this partly for reasons of his own vanity, or because he dislikes the House leader Andrea Leadsom, or because, with his time as Speaker likely to come to an end this year, he is willing to go out with all guns blazing. But there are far bigger issues at stake in his action too.Bercow took his stand because Brexit has presented modern parliamentary politics with a choice that, in the end, it could not avoid. On the one hand, the Commons could do what modern British parliaments have normally done and, after much huffing and puffing, allow the government to get what it wants. On the other, it could do what parliaments too rarely do, but which many non-partisans have longed for it to do and, working cross-party, drag down the power of ministers and all the patronage and power at their disposal.The confrontation between MPs and ministers that consumed Westminster today was not ultimately caused by Bercow’s ego. It was caused by the convergence of the immensity of Brexit – which threatens to reshape the economy, politics and international standing of Britain in massive ways – and the reality that May leads a deeply ided party and government in a hung parliament where there is no majority for anything without formal or informal cross-party alliances. In such circumstances, the old rules were always likely to buckle and bend and they did so.Parliamentary sovereignty has always been significantly qualified, ever since the Glorious Revolution of 1688-89 laid its modern foundations. Parliament is not in practice a collective Athenian-style assembly that does whatever it chooses, though its powers are sweeping. Parliament is a legislature that is controlled and structured to benefit the executive – even a weak one such as May’s. Parliament’s sovereignty is managed by ministers on behalf of the crown, today as in 1689. It was against this that Bercow took his stand.Over the years there have been repeated complaints – particularly, of course, from the opposition – that parliament’s sovereignty is being systematically gelded by ministers. Under governments of every kind, Labour as well as Conservative, ministers have tightened their grip over backbenchers through systems of appointments, control of the agenda, delegated powers, and timetabling. The growth of the career politician, often at the expense of MPs with wider experience, has made the job of control easier.There has always been some pushback – in the growth of more independent select committees, for example. But it has taken Brexit added to a hung parliament to lift the counter-movement to this new level, in the run-up to the Brexit showdown on 15 January. The implication of Bercow’s decision to call Grieve’s amendment – against the advice, it seems, of his clerks – is that governments will now find it more difficult to control the parliamentary timetable.There is no suggestion that Bercow’s ruling guarantees a better Brexit outcome. Still less that it will open the floodgates to parliament setting its own agenda more generally, or to the Speaker writing the Queen’s speech – backbench power has more purchase in a hung parliament than one with a landslide majority, and Brexit is a uniquely important and isive issue. But the breach in ministerial control has been made all the same. And we have gone, in less than two years, from May’s attempt to implement Brexit without any parliamentary involvement, to a position in which the prime minister is increasingly having her Brexit options shaped for her by a cross-party alliance of MPs.These MPs are, moreover, an exceptionally able and talented bunch. They eclipse many on their own frontbenches. You could almost say that the real leaders of the Tory party are now Nicky Morgan and Nick Boles, while the effective leaders of Labour this week were Yvette Cooper and Stephen Kinnock.It would not, of course, be quite true. The parties and their leaders remain the key players. Nevertheless, a new and more rational form of parliamentary politics is evolving around the old parties. The faith-based politics of left and right is struggling to respond.This is not to claim that faith is unimportant or that pragmatism will triumph. But pragmatism is having a good run, against the odds and in the most important of circumstances. It will surely leave a deep mark, not just on the Brexit outcome next week but also on the politics of the near future more generally. Amid so much failure elsewhere in our political system, this seems worth cherishing and cheering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/280f5edabdea7850d71ebf6ded8ff7df6d307919/0_231_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88c2b684b248787e0c578477bc3dc603","title":"chicken modern factory farm anthropocene new age","story":"Our future in the Anthropocene, the new age now we live in, looks just like the lives of the 66 billion chickens consumed every year: nasty, brutish and shortHave you ever thought much about the bones that remain littered in front of you after finishing a plate of chicken wings? New research suggests that Gallus gallus domesticus – the modern factory farmed chicken – might not be just a Sunday lunch staple but instead a marker of a new age in Earth’s history.The 11,700 or so years following the last major ice age are collectively called the Holocene, a geological chapter in earth’s biography that includes the development of all human civilization. Some experts argue that humans have fundamentally altered the earth’s biosphere to the point where we now live in a new age called the Anthropocene, an amalgamation of the Greek words for “new” and “human”. Copernicus was wrong: the earth doesn’t revolve around the sun anymore. It revolves around us.When and why the Anthropocene begins is up for debate. Many point to sometime in the mid-20th century when we started dropping atomic bombs, paving the world over in cement and concrete and filling our oceans with plastic as a beginning to the so-called Anthropocene. Now new research from geologists and archeologists published in the Royal Society poses another possible marker that began in the 1950s as well: the rise of the factory farmed chicken.In 2016, the world consumed almost 66 billion chickens. To put that number in perspective, we slaughtered 1.5 billion pigs, 550 million sheep, 460 million goats, and 300 million cattle that same year. About nine out of every 10 terrestrial animals slaughtered for food globally are chickens. And that looks like it may only increase as chicken consumption is growing – especially in developing countries – faster than the consumption of any other land animal.Our planet is covered with chickens. If you took a snapshot of all the birds alive on the planet at this very moment, domesticated poultry – mostly chickens – would have a total biomass about three times greater than all wild bird species combined.These chickens are a product of modern technology that rivals almost any other innovation over the past 50 years in its scope and impact on our food system. The modern chicken has been bred into an entirely new animal that looks very little like its wild counterpart. Through breeding techniques and feed manipulation, farmed chickens quadrupled in size between the mid-1950s to the mid-2000s.If chickens were not killed at such a young age (on average, five to seven weeks), they would be unable to survive into maturity. While their bodies, limbs and organs simply cannot function properly into adolescence, their bones may last a very long time. In the wild, bird carcasses either decay or are scavenged by predators. Chicken bones, on the other hand, are discarded in landfills where anaerobic activity tends to mummify more than decay. We may see our appetite for 66 billion chickens a year crystalized in the fossil record long into the future.Chickens aren’t only changing our fossil record. They’re pecking away at our environment in more profoundly concerning ways. So concerning, in fact, that the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization has said that “the environmental impacts of the sector are substantial” and include the acceleration of climate change, erosion of bioersity, pollution of soil and water, overexploitation of natural resources, and the list goes on.If chickens really do symbolize the brave new world of our human-altered biosphere, how should we think about the future of our farms, our food and our feathered friends?When dinner on our table is proposed alongside atomic bombs, concrete and plastic in its long-term impact on our planet, we need to step back and think deeply about how we got here and where we are headed. We might have to reconsider the scale and scope of industrialized animal agriculture. We might need to look beyond our plates to the social, economic and environmental impacts of our food. We might even be forced to fundamentally redesign our food system from the ground up.However it shifts our perspective, the chicken-induced Anthropocene is more writing on the wall that industrialized animal agriculture has gone too far. Without radically reimagining our food system, our future in the Anthropocene looks just like the lives of those 66 billion chickens every year: nasty, brutish and short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7f1ae67b622305e26e5ec7f03e0dd342bd0b31/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b351adfde5a9db7cfb04b9f6f50b370","title":"jeremy corbyn election nightmare labour brexit","story":"Jeremy Corbyn called for a general election in a speech in Wakefield on Thursday morning. That’s what oppositions do, so what’s new? The government’s essential, all-consuming, defining policy of our era is about to be voted down in parliament. The shadow of the loss of 5,000 Jaguar Land Rover jobs sharpens the immediacy of the nightmare – with Brexit said to be partly to blame. As Corbyn declared: “A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.”That used to mean a government fell and a prime minister resigned, with an election inevitable. No longer. Instead, here is a government with no majority, surviving only on bungs to a handful of unionist extremists who don’t represent remain-voting Northern Ireland. Even then, it still loses vote after humiliating vote, with no intention of resigning in the honourable, old-fashioned way. If John Bercow – this morning called “speaker of the devil” by the Sun – is stretching the rules, he is only responding to this extraordinary constitutional crisis. The spirit of his role is to stand up for parliament, as this majority-less government makes serial attempts to deny MPs any say.If, as expected, the PM’s deal fails on 15 January, Labour will immediately call for a vote of no confidence in her government, as it should. But it’s unlikely any Tories will vote to bring themselves down, causing an immediate election. The Labour conference prescribed a sequence for what happens next, deciding to keep open all options, including a second referendum.But what if Corbyn got his wish? It is just possible: if the likes of Amber Rudd and Dominic Grieve think their own government is driving Britain headlong into a no-deal exit, they might pull the emergency brake and vote themselves down. But an election called now would cause both major parties near-terminal dilemmas in how to fight it. Labour might hope, and try, to make it about other issues, but this time there would be no ducking the question. On Thursday, Corbyn talked of a victorious Labour government reopening negotiations on better terms. That’s what he must say this week, in the prescribed sequencing, but next week that will change. It is entirely impossible that Labour, its members, its MPs and polling pressure from its voters could allow a campaign in favour of any kind of Brexit but nor, many say, could it baldly call for remain. It would have to put a referendum into its manifesto, with the party supporting remain. There would be dissenters.But that would be nothing compared with the warfare that would break out over the Tory manifesto in an election now. The party would fragment in radically different directions: European Research Group v remainers, referendumites, Canadians and Norwegians. Besides, they would need a new leader fast, and their membership would choose a more isive ardent Brexiteer.A chaotic general election might be catnip to political commentators, psephologists and constitutional academics, fuelling speculation that out of this mayhem new parties might be forged in a changed political landscape. Frankly, I see no significant change without proportional representation. Until then, iron electoral lore locks all change within the two and half parties we have, crushing newcomers. Voters will still have to hold their noses and vote for the portmanteau party they least dislike, far left and far right of each party obliged to cohabit unhappily. Just possibly out of all this might come popular demand for electoral reform – an understanding that this is no dry constitutional Westminster topic but a burning democratic right to vote for a party of their own choice. There’s no sign of this as yet.Back to Labour and Corbyn’s speech: I remain optimistic that Labour will do the right thing at every crucial stage in this Brexit agony. It has so far. Labour people have been infuriated by Corbyn’s apparent – and probable – support for Brexit, his lifelong views unchanged. But what matters is what he does. Step by step the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the tacticians who never take their eye off an ultimate Labour victory, have been sure not to get ahead of the game, careful not to offend Labour leave seats. The Mirror reports that some 20 Labour MPs in leave seats might vote for May’s deal if an amendment passes guaranteeing working and environmental rights. I have my doubts: some might abstain – but vote for this Tory government? Surely not.Ifwhen May’s deal falls, and Labour fails to summon up an election, there will be just three days – probably only hours – for Labour to declare its next step. In that time, May is obliged to produce her plan B or a tweaked plan A again. Here comes the crunch. Convenient flannelling and ambivalence will end. On Tuesday, Starmer suggested article 50 and withdrawal would have to be extended, but he knows that’s likely to be allowed only for an election or a referendum, not for more dithering. Corbyn didn’t mention that in his speech. Nor has he called for a referendum yet, sticking to a Labour Brexit plan: but then timing is everything. This was not the day – but decision time will come after next Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29f23449c88d899420d6032b376260760100e5c9/0_234_3728_2238/master/3728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18998e5cf798dad5b13ece5bb84cfd6b","title":"norway plus labour brexit","story":"The party must push for an election. But a Norway-type deal could be the only one that commands a parliamentary majorityThere are no good options for Labour on Brexit. Accepting this fact is both depressing and liberating. Being on the left is supposed to be about unbounded optimism, a belief that what is deemed politically impossible by the “sensible grownups” of politics can be realised, with sufficient imagination and determination. But recognising that there is no magic button that will end the Brexit debate is to be freed of the stress of searching for the impossible.Supporters of every position on Brexit should be honest about the downsides of their chosen strategies. Labour’s priority is, rightly, a general election. When Theresa May declared from a Downing Street podium that she was seeking to dissolve parliament in April 2017, she wanted to make the election entirely about Brexit. Labour did not allow her to do so, shifting the conversation on to domestic issues, where it was strong, from hiking taxes on the rich to investing in public services to public ownership: issues that unite remainers and leavers. Even though voters have priorities other than Brexit, such as stagnating wages, housing and the NHS, repeating the 2017 strategy this time would be far more challenging, to put it mildly. Labour’s electoral coalition, which encompasses both pro-remain Kensington and pro-leave Ashfield – will be placed under severe strain. The fact that Brexit dominates political debate is bad for Labour because it suppresses its anti-establishment politics its leading figures are left looking like triangulating politicians, the same as the all the rest.Then there’s a second referendum, which may yet happen. Labour will have to make the best of it if it does. Yet we have learned from the Scottish independence vote and with Brexit what referendums do to our politics. They foster bitter isions in ways that parliamentary elections tend not to do. That is why they can be such uniquely fertile political territory for the populist and far right. A referendum campaign would in effect hand the most demagogic, reactionary elements of British life a megaphone for several months. There are those who say well, we are already bitterly ided – how much worse can it get? To put it gently, they lack imagination: a new vote will be far uglier than the last, and its advocates should at least devise a strategy to deal with that.Although economic grievances were critical in delivering the referendum result, Brexit has fomented an all-out culture war. The most meaningful ision in society is not between remainers and leavers, or young people and their grandparents, or even Labour or Tory voters. It is between a rapacious elite that has plunged Britain into economic and social crisis on one hand, and a majority that suffers the consequences on the other. The culture war distracts from this understanding of class politics, which underpins Labour’s mission. In a referendum, Labour will risk looking as if it supports the status quo. All the work it has done in leave-supporting constituencies, without which it cannot win an election, may be fatally undermined. The left was long berated for emphasising principles over power, for not understanding that without forming a government it cannot help people. Now it pursues an electoral strategy to win an election and deal with the injustices that caused Brexit, the same people denounce it for putting party ahead of country. A pro-Brexit slogan such as “Tell them again” will resonate and inflame passions. Polls show there is no decisive majority for remain – and that’s in the absence of an up-and-running leave campaign. Imagine if leave won again? The narrative would be that a remain elite had tried to subvert the result, dragged the nation through another vicious campaign, and must never be listened to again.Another possibility is what has been labelled “common market 2.0”, or Norway plus. Britain would remain part of the single market and enter a permanent customs union. Is this a good option? No. None of them are. But such a deal would solve the intractable Northern Ireland border problem and its proponents say the EU would no longer have jurisdiction over agricultural policy, fisheries and justice. Britain would be able to resist closer political integration. True, freedom of movement would not end – from my own perspective, a good thing – but technically controls can be implemented if the government is able to prove “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”. Britain would also be able to shape its own rules on the financial sector. Norway plus advocates also claim it would mean significantly lower financial contributions, though this needs to be proven.There is one key issue of contention: state aid and policies of public ownership and economic interventionism, which Labour fears will undermine its ability to implement a transformative agenda. Common market 2.0 proponents point out that Norway has among the highest levels of state aid in Europe. On this, I defer to the economist Laurie Macfarlane. He suggests current rules do not preclude social democracy within certain limits but could represent a block on going further. Labour would have to test this argument in office: any bid to stop an elected government enacting its agenda would trigger a confrontation that, for the sake of democracy, Labour would have to win, appealing for international solidarity in the process. The arrangement might prove a stopgap. If it failed – for instance, if Labour’s proposals were blocked – it would have to end.Is this kicking the Brexit can down the road? Yes. Is it desperate? Of course it is. But look, the social fabric of Britain is disintegrating. There is a housing crisis, child poverty is soaring, wages are stagnant, and our public services and infrastructure are falling apart. The more our relationship with a trading bloc becomes the central axis of political discourse, the less attention Britain’s social crisis receives, and the worse it becomes.When May’s deal is voted down, Labour must push for a general election. But Norway plus may end up the only proposal that commands a majority in parliament. Labour supporters would be able to recall that what unites them is much greater than simply Brexit. Could it definitely be negotiated even if MPs vote for it? That’s not certain. But given the other unappetising choices on the plate, perhaps it is the only one Labour will be able to swallow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ce9f863fb8a231e0326ac0063d9074fb284a2ee/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58acf7bf1bb371aab11ba2529d3610a4","title":"id turned over 1m before i got my a levels the 21 year old online selling sensation","story":"Monty George was 12 when he first started selling on eBay. Now his company Furniture Box is turning over more than £1m and looking to expandMonty George says he was always something of an entrepreneur. “When I was 12 I’d save up my pocket money to buy small things from Poundland like sushi-makers and laptop lights and then I’d list them online and make a small profit,” he says.“From there I tried selling everything from watches to electronics. When I was 15 I bought a load of mini dirt bikes from China to sell, but I realised that if anything went wrong with them I wouldn’t know how to fix them. I’d heard that furniture was one of the biggest growing markets online, so I ordered a couple of shipping containers of coffee tables and dining tables and it all went from there.”But being a budding eBay entrepreneur set him apart from his classmates. “I’d use my lunch breaks to answer messages from customers. I remember one Christmas selling touchscreen tablets that had a really high fault rate and I came back from school to over 100 messages to reply to, which was pretty soul destroying,” he says. “And then of course it was hard seeing friends all go off to university, but I remember the night before I got my A-level results my total eBay sales ticked over £1m. It was quite poetic really.”Three years later and his company Furniture Box has outgrown his parents’ shed and moved into a warehouse and office space in Wiltshire, with a team of six and growing. In 2016 the company turned over £1.06m. “The best thing for me is the customer feedback,” says George. “I get a real buzz when someone gives a product a good review or is happy with something that I’ve put a lot of time and effort into choosing.”Of course, things don’t always go right. “I remember an elderly gentleman recently purchased a chair from us and he left negative feedback, saying it was difficult to put together because he had Parkinson’s disease,” says George. “So I decided to travel to Surrey where he lives and help him put it up.”George says that building a successful business at such a young age has come with sacrifices. “When my friends were out partying at uni, I was putting the graft into the business, often working from 7am until 9pm, seven days a week,” he says.“I did have moments where I thought: ‘Have I made the right call here?’ I remember over one Christmas and new year period, while all my mates were having fun or relaxing, me and my business partner Dan were in our freezing cold warehouse putting up industrial storage racking. But I just knew that the business wasn’t going to grow without us putting in the time and effort.”Now his friends are graduating university, George says the tables have turned. “They’re struggling to start at the bottom, and have a lot of debt,” he says. “In a way I feel ahead of the curve because I’ve spent the last few years knuckling down. I actually think that being young is a great time to start a business. I had no overheads when I was living at my parents’ house and no real outgoings. It would’ve been much harder to do this if I’d had a mortgage and a family to feed. I also think that when you’re young you’re more willing to take risks, and obviously growing up online I had a really good understanding of how the technology worked.“I’ve picked up a lot of advice from family and friends over the years,” he adds. “One thing that particularly sticks out is not to over expand and get carried away, which is easy to do when stock is selling well.” But, he says, he’s still made “every mistake under the sun”.“In 2014 I got a huge tax bill because I hadn’t realised I had to pay VAT, so I had to sell some of my belongings to raise the money.”His advice to other young people who want to start a business is to get to know the market, and not feel daunted by what’s already out there. “Find your niche and offer something unique,” says George. “And if it’s going well, don’t stay still because other people will catch up with you. See what you can do better.”George says he’d like to see Furniture Box become as big as Ikea or Furniture Village. “We’d like to not just be doing furniture, but to expand into other areas of homeware and maybe start selling packs of furniture for new-builds,” he says. “There’s a lot of untapped potential out there that I can’t wait to get my teeth into.”Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

He tells  Kate Wills why all it takes to start a business is a good idea and a bit of goTouker Suleyman remembers the moment he almost lost it all. Although he’s now one of the UK’s best-known retail magnates, with more than 40 years’ experience of rescuing British brands such as Hawes \u0026amp Curtis and Ghost, when he was 28 he nearly went bankrupt. “I’d been convinced to invest in a public company in the era when shares were going up on a rumour,” he recalls. “We didn’t do a proper due diligence. I distinctly remember getting the phone call on a Friday afternoon to say the company’s going bust. It had a deficit of £20m. Like a pack of cards, my businesses went down. I sold my house. I was totally out of my depth.”After that career low, Suleyman went into business with his brother – investing in property, then growing his fashion manufacturing business to become one of the biggest suppliers to the UK high street. In 2001, he decided to buy struggling Jermyn Street shirt shop Hawes \u0026amp Curtis for £1. “At the time, they were supplying shirts to Ralph Lauren in Europe and I thought: ‘If they can do it why can’t I do it?’” he says.“Hawes \u0026amp Curtis had about £700,000 of debt, so we paid everybody off, launched with a revamp and scaled up to six shops quite quickly. We’ve turned things around – we’ve now got 25 stores.”Suleyman says that saving Hawes \u0026amp Curtis, and Ghost – which he bought in 2008 – are his biggest accomplishments. “The thing I’m proudest of is all these businesses I’ve helped,” he says.These successes are hard-earned. “It takes a lot of sacrifice to build up a business,” he says. “There’s a bit of luck, as well as that passion and determination to make it happen. But it’s mainly a lot of time. People go on holiday for three weeks – I go for three days. When my daughters were small it was hard being away from the family and working all the time.”A self-confessed “workaholic”, Suleyman says he has no plans to retire. “I’m asked that question all the time and I say I’ll work until I drop dead,” he jokes. “I have a passion for problem-solving and helping people. I get so many people approaching me with business ideas and I wish the government would realise there’s a lot of people with talent, and devise more schemes to help them. We’re a country of entrepreneurs — young and old. If you’ve got a good idea that solves a problem and there’s a market for it then you can start a business at any age.”Suleyman was able to indulge that passion for helping small businesses when he joined the panel of Dragons’ Den in 2015, investing in a variety of businesses, from baby toys to brownies. “The first thing I look at when deciding to invest is: ‘Can I work with this person?’” he says. “They can have the best idea in the world, but if you can’t work with the entrepreneur then it’s not worth it. One of my favourite investments recently wasn’t on the show – she came to see me personally. She’s a mum of two who had invented a teething toy called Matchstick Money. The business is doing really well, and she was recently offered £5m for it. That’s what makes me happy – there’s this person who lives in the countryside with her kids who’s come up with a great idea and we’ve created value for her.”As for investments he wishes he’d made, Suleyman has no regrets. “There’s always another deal,” he says.‘There’s never been a better time to start your own business’Touker Suleyman was one of the judges for the eBay Doers scheme – where we asked you to share your brilliant business ideas for a chance to be part of a 10-week incubator aimed at helping budding entrepreneurs with funding and expert mentorship.“All the entries were innovative and people had clearly thought about their product, their strategy and what the market was like,” says Suleyman. For the startups that missed out, Suleyman says the future is still bright. “There’s never been a better time to start your own business,” he says.And eBay is here to help you do exactly that – just like the eBay Doers, if you’ve got an idea and a bit of go, you’re ready to become an entrepreneur. “If you’ve got a great idea for a product, and you can source it and put it online, you’ve got a business,” says Suleyman.

Here’s what the Doers have ‘done’ so farThis September, 15 budding business owners, their eight mentors and a clutch of entrepreneurial experts gathered at the  offices. They came for workshops and talks, to meet, to learn and to share ideas at the launch of the eBay Doers scheme.These 15 were selected from hundreds of entrants – each with a bright idea and the potential to build a brilliant business. Their prize: 10 weeks of expert mentorship, plus funding, photography and publicity to help launch or grow their business through eBay.A crack team of business experts, all passionate about passing on their knowledge, will help our 15 entrepreneurs to take things to the next stage. Along with support from eBay Concierge – a tailored service for eBay members that helps them with their buying and selling queries – they’ll hone their products, build up a customer base and, hopefully, create sustainable businesses – starting with our workshop day.So what did our new eBay entrepreneurs learn about turning their business ideas into success stories? They heard inspiring talks from eBay millionaires Mo Bro’s, eBay’s Concierge team and our Doers judge and Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Touker Suleyman, before growth consultant Tom Szekeres held a masterclass on advanced social media.Szekeres taught our Doers the principles on which to build a successful brand – and how to tell stories rather than simply share facts on social media. Doer Catherine White, who makes intricate headpieces for weddings, theatre and re-enactments, says that the most valuable thing she has learned so far is how to make the most of her social media presence.Since the workshop, White’s mentor, workwear designer Joanna Dai, has been pushing her in the right direction. “Joanna taught me about using hashtags on Instagram, and it’s worked brilliantly,” she says. “Seconds after posting, I’m getting lots of likes.”“Catherine’s launched a Facebook page, and tightened up her Instagram posts,” adds Dai. “I’ve advised her to focus on one of six themes for each post – for example, a standalone product, or her headpieces showcased on a model, or a woodland scene.“She’s been incredible – enthusiastic, proactive and passionate about her product. Our next steps are to try and find comparable products on eBay and look at what they’re doing well, and what formats and key words they’re using. We’ll be testing a few things out and seeing how it goes.”Product photographer Kevin Summers also offered his expertise at the workshop, delivering insider tips that provided lightbulb moments for many of our Doers. These included how to get the lighting just right for products shots, and the trick of creating an “infinity curve” as the backdrop to photographs. Placing a smooth, curved surface behind and underneath products avoids harsh lines and makes products stand out.Meanwhile David Long, who sells personalised golf head covers through his company, Babouche Golf, has thrown himself into revamping his own website, as well as launching a fresh new site on eBay.“Tom Szekeres told me I needed a better camera,” says Long, whose eventual aim is to work from home in order to spend more time with his teenage daughters. “When I started out, I didn’t want to just throw money at something that might not work. But Tom and Kevin’s masterclasses taught me that you should try to be original and work on getting these things right. If images go wrong, you can always try again.”Introductions made and expertise taken on board, our Doers headed out to apply what they’d learned, bouncing ideas off their mentors and using eBay’s services to maximise their marketplaces. Luke Damian-Grint, who is developing a range of bone-conducting sunglasses, was invited to his mentor’s head offices for some tailored advice.“Luke came down to our facility, and he had loads of questions on how to grow his business,” says mentor Walter Gleeson, co-founder of eBay behemoth Music Magpie. “I talked him through some of the pitfalls, especially dealing with problems as a focus, rather than as an afterthought. Customers who have a great experience don’t always leave feedback – but those who don’t, do.”So what’s next for our Doers? “Being pushed by Joanna has encouraged me to keep going at it, and I’m feeling really motivated,” says White. “Both Touker and Joanna encouraged me to raise my prices, and people are still buying, which is is a major leap forward.”Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

More than £6.1m of that went on top £25,000-plus payments for graduates with firsts in chemistry, computing, mathematics, modern foreign languages and physics.The analysis comes as the education secretary, Damian Hinds, prepares to launch the government’s teacher recruitment and retention strategy.Official statistics published in November revealed the government had missed its teacher training targets in most secondary school subjects.The DfE roundly rejected Labour’s criticisms of the bursaries policy. According to officials, though the employment rate for bursary-holders who qualify as teachers is lower than the equivalent rate for non-bursary-holders, it is down to the quality of the graduates who attract bursaries who are in greater demand elsewhere in the economy, rather than the award of a bursary itself.The schools standards minister, Nick Gibb, said: “Our bursaries and scholarships are not just an exercise in increasing teacher numbers.“They are specifically tailored so that we attract the right candidates for certain vital subjects and developed with bodies such as the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of Chemistry.“This is especially important in a competitive graduate labour market with unemployment at its lowest level since the 1970s.“In addition to these bursaries, we are working with school leaders and unions on a strategy to drive recruitment, boost retention and strip away unnecessary workload, to ensure that teaching remains an attractive and fulfilling profession.”The DfE is testing new financial incentives for mathematics teachers – who are in particularly short supply – including upfront bursaries of £20,000 and a maths scholarship worth £22,000. These are followed by two additional payments of up to £7,500 to encourage talented maths teachers to stay in the profession.Jack Worth, the school workforce lead at the National Foundation for Educational Research, said: “There has been a long-term need to attract teachers into subjects such as maths and science which offer the highest bursaries.“However, they are mostly aimed at increasing recruitment into training and, in order to be effective and offer good value for money, bursaries need to be coupled with a robust retention strategy.”Rayner promised teachers more money under Labour. “Years of real-terms pay cuts have made it impossible for schools to recruit the staff they need, and teachers are leaving the profession in record numbers,” she said.“There is a generation of children paying the price for Tory failure in our schools.“Through our National Education Service, Labour will invest in our schools and provide ringfenced funding to give teachers the pay rise they deserve.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45d9716561460371fccdcb350e07ee95d00c4845/0_647_3280_1969/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51c4f1c47e7e1bad19217ca582036a94","title":"dog food made from insects on sale","story":"The UK’s first dog food made from insects goes on sale this week, which its manufacturers say could help reduce the environmental damage caused by the massive volumes of meat routinely fed to dogs and cats.Environmental experts have long recommended insects as a relatively sustainable food source that could help end world hunger and reduce the damaging environmental impact of meat production. Insects are also very nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids, and are easy for animals to digest.“Animals and humans have been eating insects since the dawn of time” said Yora founder Tom Neish. “We have trialled 29 recipes to find the perfect combination of great tasting ingredients and are very proud of the end result. Yora enables dog owners to take the lead in giving their dog a nutritious, tasty food while having a positive impact on the environment.”In November, Sainsbury’s became the first major UK grocer to stock edible crickets – barbecued crickets sold as snacks in small bags. In total, more than 1,000 insect species are eaten around the world but hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations.The insects in Yora’s dog food are the larvae of black soldier flies (Hermetia illucens) which are reared by protein nutrient company Protix in Eindhoven in the Netherlands.

Coal must be confined to history, where it now belongs, and we must prioritise investment in renewable energy.”But Banks, buoyed by the high court decision, believes its mine can go ahead even while the government is pursuing a coal phase-out. It promises 100 much-needed jobs and restoration of the landscape, saying the surface mine is a “unique opportunity to bring substantial investment to the Druridge Bay area and improve the lives of its people and wildlife for many years to come”. It promises no mining activity within 500 metres of the beach.The company is forging the last stand for coal as the only firm attempting to start new surface mines in the UK, and Druridge Bay represents the greatest of its ambitions. It went ahead with another open-cast project at Dipton in the Derwent Valley, after attempts by campaigners to get Brokenshire to stop it failed.“We would … urge Mr Brokenshire to give us permission to progress work at Highthorn as soon as possible, and thereby enable us to extend a track record of investing and creating jobs in Northumberland that stretches back four decades,” Banks said in a statement.From the Drift Cafe overlooking the beach, Duncan Lawrence and others from Save Druridge Bay have built their opposition to the mine over the last four years. They focus on environmental concerns about the mine’s impact on protected wildlife, such as wintering pink-footed geese and yellow wagtails, as well as its impact on the tourist industry, with the pit visible from nearby roads and the beach dunes.“Part of the reason I settled in Northumberland over 20 years ago was because of its tranquility and the natural beauty of the landscape,” said Lawrence.“I think that’s why so many people choose to visit the area now. This open-cast will damage one of the area’s greatest assets and hamper a more sustainable emerging local economy for the short-term benefit of the fossil fuels industry, which we should be moving away from.”Neil Taylor, a former miner who worked at Ellington Colliery, which closed in 2005 and was the last remaining deep mine in the north-east, also argues that the area has “had its fill of coal”.But not all share this view. Northumberland county council stands by its decision in 2016 to grant planning permission and in supporting the open-cast mine, the Labour leader of the council, Grant Davey, is at odds with his own party leadership.Barry Gardiner, the shadow secretary for international trade, said the mine should be rejected if Britain is to fulfil its pledge to phase out coal. “Approving a new open-cast coal mine would make a mockery of that promise. It would leave the UK’s international reputation on climate change in tatters, and raise serious questions about the suitability of this government’s bid to host 2020’s UN climate negotiations,” he said.As well as opening a rift between local and national Labour politicians, the project has caused bitter community infighting.Ex-miner Barry Kent, who also worked at Ellington, believes the environmental card has been overplayed.“Restoration is far more strictly controlled than it was in years gone by, and who can deny the amenity and wildlife habitat that is now Druridge Bay Country Park – which is itself a former open-cast site,” he said.Anne Harris of Coal Action Network, which is fighting Banks’s plans across the north-east, said approving the mine would make a mockery of the government’s climate change commitment. “If James Brokenshire approves this scheme at Highthorn, then he’s showing the government has no intention of meaningfully following through on the 2025 coal phase-out,” she said.“It would mean the concerns and opposition of people in the area are being ignored for a coal company that’s trying to grab resources and run.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e44cb38bc008addc4334ed180825f925943d94e8/0_0_4398_2932/master/4398.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53a1d4034ce7280922e7f3cb4f235893 480w","title":"island hungry ghosts review australia guantanamo gabrielle brady","story":"Gabrielle Brady’s powerful portrait of the lives of asylum seekers warehoused on Christmas Island is fierce and compassionateFilm-maker Gabrielle Brady tells a powerful and moving story from inside Australia’s Guantánamo: Christmas Island, the country’s offshore territory near Java, where asylum seekers and boat people are warehoused in grim conditions that the authorities are in no hurry to conceal – because of the deterrent factor, an important part of the government’s anti-migrant crackdown since 2013. (The similar Manus Island facility has now been closed but the equally grisly Nauru is still in business.)Poh Lin Lee is a torture and trauma counsellor permitted to give therapy to detainees, who are terrifyingly scarred mentally. These sessions have been reconstructed as filming current detainees was not possible conversations take place with migrants who have been released. Brady could perhaps have made that point clearer (there is a self-evidently imagined sequence at the beginning depicting an escape), but the pure emotional agony of their testimony is real enough, and the sequence where an Afghan man talks about how he was separated from his elderly mother is devastating: “It’s a kind of hell here … Hell is where you see your family suffering and you can’t do anything.”The awful truth is that the detainees are getting just as much trauma here as in the place they left or on their terrible sea journey. Lee’s patients often simply never show up for their sessions, having been moved to another prison camp, and Lee is told nothing. However brutal, this film is also unexpectedly beautiful, because of the almost dreamlike shots of the red crabs that swarm over the island, like the unquiet spirits of prisoners.The title comes from the practice of the island’s Malay Chinese community, who pay homage to the souls of their forebears: indentured labourers brought over a century ago in comparably cruel circumstances.

Magnolia. Being John Malkovich. Fight Club. The Blair Witch Project. The Sixth Sense. Office Space. Man on the Moon. The Talented Mr. Ripley. Boys Don’t Cry. Three Kings. Toy Story 2. The Iron Giant. Eyes Wide Shut. Cruel Intentions. Election. American Pie. Notting Hill and Runaway Bride. 1999 might be the greatest year of modern cinema. I think so. If you aren’t nutty about two-thirds of these films, do you even like movies?What’s certain, however, is that 1999 is the most pivotal year of modern cinema – the moment that Hollywood anointed the chosen ones who would become the heroes of the new millennium, from David Fincher to Spike Jonze to an ingenue named Angelina Jolie, who introduced herself to the public by winning best supporting actress for playing a sociopathic mental patient. Girl, Interrupted wasn’t Jolie’s first film. But it was the movie that engraved her on the A-list, a pattern that’s also true for Hillary Swank in Boys Don’t Cry, Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley, Reese Witherspoon in Election, Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You, and Russell Crowe in The Insider.What explains 1999’s extraordinary films? DVD sales began in 1997 and flooded studios with extra cash, especially in those first years as home viewers built their collection. Studios invested the windfall in a generation of upstart directors, predicting that audiences would buy a good film twice: once in the theater, and again for their shelf.Suddenly, the geniuses who’d been discovered during Sundance’s 90s indie wave were entrusted with millions in play-cash plus marketing muscle. It was a creative renaissance. Directors seized the chance to get weird. Paul Thomas Anderson scored $37m to assemble the lyrical montage Magnolia. David O Russell shouldered $47m to satirize the Gulf war. Even Spike Jonze, a music video director with zero film credits to his name, secured $13m to transport audiences to a multiverse of John Malkoviches.The risk paid off. These up-and-coming directors became major 21st-century voices. Still, part of the reason Anderson, Russell and Jonze are still the kings of the kooks is that today’s directors haven’t been given the same golden ticket. The talent exists the cash doesn’t. Ambitious mid-priced films went extinct when the DVD empire began to crumble in 2008. Instead of betting on auteurs, studios put their chips on big screen superheroes. Break out at this year’s Sundance, and instead of being handed the freedom to dream, you’ll be given the keys to a franchise – and a conference table of producers as chaperones. Or you’ll stay small and scrappy forever, cranking out a terrific body of work that struggles to be seen amid the crush of streaming media competing for the audience’s attention at a couple bucks a pop, or flat-out free.Much has changed. Twenty years ago, two big-budget Julia Roberts romantic comedies atop the box office chart was a given. Now, both the genre and the star have been squired to streaming. Raunchy teenage comedies like American Pie are, like, totally awkward in an era where dating and sex are on the decline, and raunchy teenage dramas like Cruel Intentions are cloistered on TV to be recast as Riverdale characters who audiences can still safely see as cartoons.Sex is out, horror is in. And for that, we can thank 1999, too, as The Blair Witch Project launched a mania for mirco-budget nightmares that refuses to crawl back under the bed. The Blair Witch Project (which still holds up fabulously) begat Paranormal Activity which begat Blumhouse Pictures who begat everything from The Purge to Get Out to Insidious to Sinister. Add all four of their budgets together, and they still cost less than Being John Malkovich – even without inflation. As for M Night Shyamalan, hyped as “The Next Spielberg” on the cover of Newsweek after The Sixth Sense, he’s finally accepted the Spielberg’s populist template never fit an egotist who prefers to provoke. He’s also found happiness in low-budget thrills like The Visit, Split and the upcoming Glass (all three produced, of course, by Blumhouse).Probe the films of 1999 and a suspicion slithers in that we’re stuck in The Matrix ourselves. The near past is repeating like a programming glitch, or, say, an endless parade of Malcovi. There’s deja vu remakes of Tarzan and The Mummy and Pokémon and Galaxy Quest and the just-announced Toy Story 4. The Star Wars universe continues to propel the box office, as it’s done since The Phantom Menace. Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst’s comedy Dick about two teen girls who bring down Nixon’s corrupt administration makes for an apropos rewatch, as does Alexander Payne’s black comedy Election, in which a high-achieving blonde female candidate hamstrung by sexism and fraud loses her campaign to a dummy who never seriously intended to win. And if the Oscars mimic this year’s Golden Globes, Green Book winning best picture will be cringeworthy as American Beauty beating a field of worthier contenders in 1999. At least Kevin Spacey won’t be in attendance.But we’re also feeling a deeper connection to 1999, one that vibrates in our wiring. The Y2K panic triggered film-makers to think pessimistically about the future of human survival. The Wachowskis assumed we were toast. Kevin Smith’s Dogma and the Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick End of Days embraced the apocalypse. And David Fincher’s Fight Club and Sam Mendes’s American Beauty feared that mankind had become too weak and materialistic to survive the millennium.What’s scary about today – a time in which our nerves are again quivering with anxieties about capitalism, despotism and an all-but-inevitable environmental catastrophe – is that we’ve now been shaped by those films’ misanthropy. Not just the mens rights activists who’ve adopted The Matrix’s red pillblue pill analogy as their own twisted “truth” or the Twitter trolls incubated on the internet who idolize Fight Club’s Tyler Durden. As for the solution, Fincher suggested boxing and domestic terrorism. Mendes touted weightlifting, crushing on underage girls, and, ultimately, suicide.In 1999, our heroes didn’t win. They failed, they disappeared, they died, they blew up their world. And they left a residue of cynicism we’re still scraping off, from our political apathy to the studios’ resentment that their DVD cash cow dropped dead. “The future is our world, Morpheus,” gloated The Matrix’s Agent Smith. He was right. Yet, we can change our tomorrow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10638854938a718c9a20b7718f88d410b65ac8e5/0_397_2598_1557/master/2598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=626e781d3a34406e169a28cffc6e650a","title":"nicole kidmans top 10 films ranked","story":"This was the performance that earned Nicole Kidman her Oscar for best actress – playing Virginia Woolf in an agonised spiritual state, somewhere between paralysis and a trance, grappling with the possibilities of fiction and her own depression. It is a good, if somewhat overrated performance, with Kidman playing to her queenly, statuesque qualities, but not quite tapping into the inner fire of her better performances. For some reason, she had to play the part with a silly prosthetic nose that made her look like Big Bird.Opinions are ided on this most conspicuous of Kidman’s castings-against-type (I prefer The Paperboy in this vein), but she brings a tough, stolid, plausible presence to her uglied-up role as the undercover cop, physically and psychologically scarred by her experiences embedded in a robbery crew. Years after the events that brutalised her, she becomes convinced that she can finally take down the culprit her bitterness and anguish are forcefully portrayed.Kidman had the distinction of working with Stanley Kubrick on his final film: hers is an intelligent and well-judged contribution to a minor, but interesting and overpoweringly atmospheric film, an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler’s 1926 novella Dream Story, updated to late-20th-century New York. Kidman plays the wife of Tom Cruise’s sexually tortured high-society doctor and she is frank and open about sexuality in a way that he is not. It is she who will keep this film from sliding down the posterity rankings.No film and no performance of Kidman’s has been more misunderstood on first release. She was cast against type in this brash, uproarious Florida noir, giving a cracking performance as Charlotte Bless, the needy, dysfunctional peroxide blonde who starts up a pen-pal romance with a killer on death row. Kidman has some truly outrageous scenes, sending up her own image and getting stuck into every luridly horrible moment. Terrific stuff.Kidman’s aura of sophisticated mystery and desire is perfect for this daring experiment in filmed theatre from master auteurprankster Lars von Trier. She plays Grace, a woman apparently on the run from criminals, who is taken in by the uptight provincial folk of Dogville, Colorado, and becomes the focus of their obsessively repressed moralism and desire. Without Kidman, this would be nothing.Kidman had her breakthrough with this terrific suspense thriller that has something of Alfred Hitchcock and Roman Polanski. She and Sam Neill play a couple alone on a yacht, who encounter a disturbing young man (Billy Zane) who begs to come aboard. This is Kidman in her early, frizzy-haired incarnation, a more natural, earthy performance than any she has since been known for, but this is great stuff as her character, left all alone, has to outwit and outmanoeuvre the creepy stranger.This is Kidman in rarefied form. Director Jane Campion creates for her, or from her, a shimmering haze of mystery in this adaptation of Henry James’s novel in which she plays the beautiful American Isabel Archer who finds herself attracted to John Malkovich’s louche and cynical artist. For many, the exquisiteness of her appearance here makes it peak Kidman. She goes into her distinctive trance, which also mesmerises the audience.This was the key early role for Kidman, a barmstorming lead turn in which, interestingly, it was director Gus Van Sant who ined that her star quality lay not in ordinariness, but in something more fabricated and unearthly. She is the sinister and ruthless weather presenter on local cable TV who is desperate to become a star at all costs. Nowadays, she would be an Instagram influencer.This is a film that grows with each rewatching and no one but Kidman could have carried it off with such dignity and flair. She plays Anna, a beautiful, wealthy Manhattan widow who is astonished when a 10-year-old boy walks into her life and announces he is the reincarnation of her dead husband. And he does this, citing details that only her late husband could possibly know. The single, extended shot of Nicole’s stricken face as we and she realise that she now believes it, is incredible, and so is her scene with the boy when they discuss how they will marry, or remarry, in 10 or so years, when he comes of age.This is the perfect Kidman film, a ghost story in the style of Henry James that, more than any other, elicits her almost spiritual aura of beauty and mystery with its occult trace of sexiness. In this movie, she is part Grace Kelly, part Deborah Kerr, with a touch of Kathleen Byron. (I should also say she was once cast as Grace Kelly in the terrible Grace of Monaco, which managed to misunderstand both Kelly and Kidman). Here, she plays the statuesque chatelaine of a grand but oppressively gloomy country house. Her husband has gone off to fight in the second world war, leaving her to deal with the children and what few servants they can afford. They are terrified by what appear to be ghosts. Kidman’s beautiful face, lit by candlelight, seems in this film to have been painted by John Everett Millais. She has a sheen of tragedy, and a kind of eroticised but refined victimhood. This is classic Kidman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c4143a9e04dfe7fd8c7cccdd46e28d2bf41c4dd/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3051f74e72409bcf14bfb0bd4e54fa61","title":"america cheese surplus production dairy farmers","story":"Demand for American cheese is falling behind supply – partly because of changing tastes but also because of Trump’s tariffsSay cheese, America. No, seriously, please start saying cheese at the grocery store. The country’s dairy farmers are depending on you.Americans eat an awful lot of cheese: almost 37lb per person, per year. Yet apparently that’s still not enough. Demand for American-made cheese is seriously falling behind supply. According to recent data from the Department of Agriculture, we’re currently experiencing a 1.4bn-pound cheese surplus.Lucas Fueff, director of dairy market intelligence at HighGround Dairy, a consulting firm, explains that cheese is literally sitting in cold storage facilities waiting for some aspiring pizza-maker to give it a home.“It’s normal to have some cheese in warehouses, to make sure there’s enough in the pipeline,” Fueff said. “The amount that’s in there currently is, if not a record, very close to record high.”In part this can be linked to lower dairy consumption and the growing popularity of veganism. Plant-based products such as almond-milk have experienced rapid sales growth.Producing American cheese helps farmers to use up milk they can’t sell and that would otherwise go off. At the end of November 2018, US cheese production had grown yet again for the 67th consecutive month.But the problem is Americans are eating less cheese, too.American diets are moving away from processed cheeses like Velveeta and Kraft, and many of the nation’s leading fast and casual restaurants are trying new things. Panera, like others, has replaced American cheese in their sandwiches with a four-cheese combo made up of fontina, cheddar, monteau and smoked gouda.In part, that’s because many Americans now think processed cheese is gross, but also because they’re au fait with quality cheese from around the world. It’s hard to turn back to an indestructible fluorescent orange mess once you’ve tried brie de meaux.“We’re seeing increased sales of more exotic, specialty, European-style cheeses. Some of those are made in the US a lot of them aren’t,” Andrew Novakovic, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University told NPR this week. Since imported cheese costs more than domestic, a few blocks of the good stuff might not leave much left in the old cheese budget for anything else.The cheese mountain is crushing farmers. “We’ve seen record numbers of dairy farms close because milk prices are so that low dairy farms aren’t profitable any more,” Feueff added. “This cheese that is hanging over the market is preventing prices from raising higher and it’s reaching a critical level.”“As long as the tariffs are still on in Mexico, it remains a challenge to move cheese out of the country and move those stocks lower,” Fueff explained.It’s not the end of the line. Analysts have noted large buyers of cheese increasing offerings or finding new ways to use it. McDonald’s recently launched a breakfast sandwich with two slices of American cheese. “Fast-food companies are taking this opportunity with low cheese prices to increase cheese on their dishes,” says Fueff.For now though, American dairy farmers are going to continue to look for ways to offload their cheese supplies. “I was just reading stories of cheese tea in China that have kind of gone viral,” Fueff said. “Maybe we need to look into that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2665540f91a887c3996ed24fd1cbf31c899e7adc/0_0_4352_2611/master/4352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5f677f7e88bc60055caa07808c6f91","title":"the new rules of eating al desko","story":"Is there a right and wrong way to lunch at your desk? Should you even be doing it at all? Experts and office workers weigh inAs winter finally begins to bite, the idea of the al-desko lunch seems increasingly alluring. No one wants to take their sandwich to the park when it’s snowing, and even the walk to the local cafe can seem too much when it is through wind and rain.But is there a right and a wrong way to eat at your desk? Should we be even doing it in the first place? We asked some experts and office workers.Absolutely not, says Henry Stewart, founder and “chief happiness officer” of the workplace consultancy Happy. “It’s madness. We’ve got to get people out of the hamster wheel of continual work. It’s not good for them and it’s not good for the organisation. All the research shows that people work more effectively if they take breaks.”It’s a smart career move, adds André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School in London. “It’s good for job satisfaction, performance, promotion … Why? Because eating is a social ritual in which people swap information.”And it’s enjoyable, says PR William Matthews. “Breaking bread with your colleagues every day is far better for team spirit than the dreaded once-in-a-blue-moon ‘organised fun’ that so many companies go in for. People are social beings and eating together is a sort of primeval thing.” He has fond memories of the boss who made everyone down tools for a “proper seated lunch with proper crockery and cutlery, so everyone could clear their heads and enjoy the food”.So, everyone agrees that eating al desko is a bad thing? Hardly. “It’s absolutely OK to eat a snack at your desk,” says Myka Meier, founder of Beaumont Etiquette. “You simply want to be cautious of eating smelly food. Etiquette is all about being kind, respectful and considerate of others.”Bruce Daisley, European vice-president at Twitter and author of The Joy of Work, has a warning for anyone tempted by a ban. “For me, this is a bit like organisations that ban you from accessing email outside work hours. The intentions are good but nannying people never has the outcome that you want. You’re turning people into infants, taking away their right to self-determination.“If people sit down to lunch together,” he adds, “they do tend to collaborate better – unless you force them to do it, in which case all that benefit tends to go. You’ve just got to let people do what they want. If you have no agency, you feel unhappy, you feel demotivated, you feel estranged from your job.”And let’s not forget that scarfing down a sandwich at your desk leaves you free to spend the rest of your break exactly as you want. A run or a visit to the gym may not give you an opportunity to bond with your colleagues, but a) not all colleagues are worth bonding with, and b) it will do wonders for your physical and mental health.Again, it depends who you talk to. It’s an “abomination”, says author Helen Jones. Etiquette expert Meier, however, thinks it “adds humour to a rather dull form of dining and makes people think of dining at their desks in a way that requires thoughtfulness”. So she’s all for it.“Unacceptable,” says Stewart. “That’s another clear rule – you don’t drink within office hours.”Spicer is less dogmatic. “In most normal offices there’s a sense of when you’re able to drink and when you’re not. In my workplace, after about 4pm on Friday it’s maybe OK to have a glass or two.“In recent years,” he notes, “there’s been a kind of blurring between workspace and non-workspace, and many organisations are beginning to design their workplaces to look like bars. Some shared workplaces provide an unlimited supply of beer as well as tea and coffee.”“I think drinking’s fine, within reason,” says Daisley. “Opening a bottle of red at your desk? Probably not OK. But there’s good evidence that a bit of moderate drinking can increase people’s affinity for one another.” Normally that’s reserved for the pub, he says, but a lot of workers don’t like them, or don’t have time to go drinking after work.A rare area of consensus: everyone agrees it’s OK to have these at your desk. But should you make your own or have some sort of round?“I think it’s a very important idea,” says Spicer. “It’s a lot like buying a round in the pub but without the alcohol. It ties the group together into a kind of formal ritual. It might seem like a pain in the butt when you have to constantly get people coffee or tea, but it binds people together and gives them a reason to speak to each other.”Or, occasionally, to shirk a few minutes’ work. “I’m against them,” says journalist Sophia Furber. “I used to have them in a previous job and whenever I got to my editor to ask if she wanted a cuppa she would snipe: ‘I’d rather you brought in some news.’” That’s not the only potential conflict: everyone who has been part of a tea or coffee round will be familiar with the colleagues who are much happier drinking than making. “There are definitely givers and takers,” is how Daisley puts it.Still, there are worse abuses of the facilities. “I once worked with a guy who made hot dogs in the coffee maker,” recalls development scientist Sarah Callens.Anything too smelly, for a start. “There used to be someone at my work who cooked fish at lunchtime,” Daisley says. “It’s just not a considerate thing to do, is it? I don’t want the office to smell of kippers. I think it’s just about respect for others.”As well as “microwaved cephalopod leftovers” and “collective fish and chips in a small shared space”, Callens objects to: “Chilli con carne al desko, sandwich platters that pong and curl in the centre of the table for two hours after everyone has eaten, chicken that smells like the bus …”Even nice smells can be a problem, Daisley warns. “Are you creating desires and urges in people that they would like to be free of?”But it’s not just odours you have to worry about. Callens has an aversion to “crisp bag rustling”, while HR manager Nicky Maine hates “people who eat apples. I cannot abide that tearing and wrenching sound, followed by munching. In fact, I detest the very word ‘munching’.”“I love the fact that we’re going to ban apples,” says Daisley. “What, we’re just going soft fruit only? Pears are OK because they’re a touch more giving …” Still, this leaves plenty on the menu.Or does it? Respondent after respondent complained about workmates who hog the microwave by cooking jacket potatoes from scratch, or fail to free it for the next user the moment the timer goes ping. And if you don’t offend your colleagues’ noses, ears or sense of urgency, you still have to contend with their aesthetic judgments. “I have a colleague who puts cheddar cheese on sweet things: hot cross buns, Christmas cake, malt loaf etc,” says teacher Johanna Johnston. “It’s the not-rightness that bothers me! None of these items need adornment.” Rosie Johnson, meanwhile, even objects to white bread sarnies, on the ground that white bread “is not the bread of self-care”.It’s enough to give you indigestion.• An earlier version of this article referred to Sarah Callens as Cullen.

The midfielder has been discussing a move for weeks and will leave Arsenal after 10 years at the club.It had been clear the Wales international would move in the summer and Juventus had been the frontrunners to secure the 28-year-old’s signature. Ramsey will be paid around £140,000 a week (£7.2m a season), making him Juventus’s second-highest earner behind Cristiano Ronaldo but ahead Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa.Juventus, who have won the past seven Serie A titles, signed Ronaldo for €100m last summer and are nine points clear of Napoli in second place after 19 games. They have reached two of the last four Champions League finals, albeit losing both, to Barcelona in 2015 and Real Madrid two years later. They are in the last 16 of this season’s competition, where they face Atlético Madrid.The Juventus manager, Max Allegri, and the director Fabio Paratici are huge admirers of Ramsey, who is likely to be given a place in the Juventus starting XI, most likely playing with Miralem Pjanic and Blaise Matuidi in a three-man midfield. He is likely to replace one of Emre Can, Rodrigo Bentancur and Sami Khedira, with the latter possibly leaving the club in the summer.Ramsey signed for Arsenal from Cardiff for £4.8m. He has played 252 top-flight games for the club, scoring 52 goals. He won three FA Cups, scoring the winning goal in the 2014 and 2017 finals.He played arguably the best football of his career during Euro 2016 when Wales reached the semi-finals, although he was suspended for the last-four game when Portugal beat Chris Coleman’s team 2-0.Ramsey has had his injury problems but Juventus are delighted to have secured him on a free transfer, while Arsenal will regret seeing a player in the prime of his career leave under these circumstances.With Arsenal choosing to renew the contract of Mesut Özil – another star whose deal was due to expire this summer – they put themselves in a position where they could not re-sign Ramsey too.

His findings, shared exclusively with the , include some of the young men telling him they can no longer watch a football match unless they have multiple bets on it commonly they have up to 25 accounts registered with online gambling companies, and their football conversations with mates are all about betting, rather than the game itself.Participants said the gambling companies’ marketing is extremely effective, particularly the offers of “free” bets, and that their losses did not feel like real money because they are placed so casually on a phone and no longer involve going to a bookmaker’s shop. One told McGee that the “buzz” of gambling is “up there with sex and drugs and rock and roll”, saying: “And I think because of that, gambling is the worst addiction of the lot.”That participant, a 31-year-old father of two in Derry, ultimately disclosed to McGee that he had turned to drug dealing for a period to try to recoup money saved for a family holiday, which he had lost gambling.The participant told McGee he had 40 accounts with online betting companies, and cannot watch matches, except the odd Premier League game, without betting on them, including in-play bets on the number of corners, throw-ins or yellow cards. He said he was “in debt to my eyeballs” on high-interest payday loans taken out to cover gambling losses, and his credit was “blacklisted to the max”.He said that gambling “took over my life for a while” and he has deep regrets about having neglected his baby daughter, because he would “sit on the laptop, continuous gambling for the day” when looking after her. He told McGee that he had lost two friends to suicide, one directly attributed to gambling debts. Derry, like other areas of Northern Ireland, has some of the highest suicide rates in Britain.As McGee came to know the groups, he found that the intensity of the new online gambling culture in football has had catastrophic impacts on many of the participants. “Far from being the knowledge-based, risk-free activity it is marketed as, the profound appeal of online sports gambling has had dire consequences for many young men,” McGee has concluded, in research which is complete and due to be published academically next year.“The study documented the unfolding stories of several young men whose everyday lives are punctuated by deepening social and financial precarity, high-interest payday loans and bank debt, mortgage defaults, family breakdown, and mental health struggles.“In particular, for young men who find themselves deprived of viable routes to employment opportunities, gambling promises an alternative route to wealth, social capital and masculine affirmation, yet most end up ensnared in a cycle of indebtedness.”McGee welcomes that proposed whistle-to-whistle advertising ban as “a step in the right direction” but said: “A generation of young people already view gambling as a normalised part of sport. Turning the tide will require stronger state regulation and a genuine commitment to redistributing a greater slice of the losses incurred by British gamblers to education and treatment for problem gambling. Educating the next generation about the dangers will be key.”The betting companies have such huge “visibility” via ubiquitous sport sponsorship, marketing and advertising, and have had a free hand for so long, that the voluntary ban is unlikely to limit the amounts being gambled, he said. The participants in his research said that once they were signed up to betting accounts and apps, the constant prompts during matches, and marketing offers, particularly offers of “free” or matched bets, were powerful encouragements to gamble.Online betting companies have targeted football in an industrialised way, paying for sponsorship and advertising, including in football-related media – the  accepts such advertising – at a time when revenues from other advertisers are diminishing. This season, nine out of the 20 Premier League clubs have a gambling company as their main shirt sponsor, and as many as 17 out of the 24 Championship clubs. SkyBet sponsors the EFL itself and its three isions, and is promoted by Sky during sports TV coverage.McGee’s work with younger fans has led him to conclude that the marketing has “hooked” a generation into “an accelerated sports culture in which the casual staking of money is an essential accompaniment to watching the game”. He says that “a new generation of sports fans view gambling as vital to their enjoyment of sport”.One of the participants, a 27-year-old living in Derry, told him: “As much as I enjoy it, gambling has ruined sport now, because you can’t watch it without thinking: ‘I should put a fiver on first goal.’ You can’t just enjoy it for what it is. It has completely taken over. All my mates can’t watch it without having a bet any more. It has ruined sport.“When I think back to when I was younger, I couldn’t wait to get home from school to see Man United playing in the Champions League on a Tuesday. It was the highlight of your week. I’d spend all day thinking about the game, and come 7pm I’d be sat glued to the TV waiting for the Champions League music to come on. Now, I’m sat there thinking about what I should be betting on, or asking the boys who the smart money’s on tonight. At times, I end up betting against United just to make it interesting! I can’t remember the last time that I just watched the game like a real fan, without having a bet on it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef74540ef3a43e6050a2e6c4ad2355d75ba5f54e/758_1467_4221_2533/master/4221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=800306f83bcc4f20a1066f8c2fdd3af2","title":"caracas street children venezuela in pictures","story":"Drugs, violence and harassment are part of daily life for the growing population of homeless children in Venezuela"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4766f5cc3a66a3a678f6dc492bbda599eb4edc70/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=077d037477b76b66792416a8fd6a5cfe","title":"deerhunter why hasnt everything already disappeared review","story":"Recorded in rural Texas, this atmospheric album switches from psych-pop to alt-rock to experimental lo-fi, held together by Bradford Cox’s drawlThe eighth album by Deerhunter comes with a lot of words attached, of varying degrees of usefulness. There is a prose poem by frontman Bradford Cox every bit as incomprehensible as the stuff Bob Dylan used to append to the back covers of his 60s albums, evidently written while Dylan was speeding his nuts off. There are simple descriptors of the themes in each song: genuinely illuminating when dealing with a writer such as Cox, whose lyrics are famously made up on the spot, stream-of-consciousness style. But most telling of all might be the press release trumpeting the arrival of Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared? to the world, unmistakably also Cox’s handiwork. No “it’s our best album yet and we’re psyched for you to hear it” for the Atlanta band. Instead, it’s largely concerned with glumly pondering what the point of making albums is at all: “In an era when attention s have been reduced to next to nothing, and the tactile grains of making music have been further reduced to algorithms and projected playlist placement.” He asks: “Is it needed now? Is it relevant? Perhaps only to a small audience.”Announcing your new album with an existential crisis is an intriguing promotional tactic, but doing things the straightforward way isn’t Deerhunter’s thing. In any other band, you suspect Cox’s sexuality would be a major talking point – he identifies as a queer asexual, and two years ago informed an interviewer he was still a virgin – but it barely gets a look in, dwarfed by his reputation as an unpredictable contrarian. His interviews veer between alarmingly frank confessions about his physical and mental health and arch pronouncements he’s described as “performance art”. They come littered with bon mots you might describe as Morrissey-esque – “I’m proud to be hideous”, “Love is a populist construction” – were it not for the fact that he spent one interview turning every answer around to the subject of how much he hates Morrissey (“he makes me want to wear fur”). Deerhunter’s musical output veers wildly, too. Much of 2013’s Monomania sounded as if it was recorded in a bin 2015’s Fading Frontier was lavishly appointed with 80s synthesisers and filled with conventionally commercial melodies its follow-up, Double-Dream of Spring, was largely instrumental and released only on cassette in a limited edition of 300, apparently in protest at both the long lead times for vinyl and the flood of freely available content online.Unpredictability is a rare and rather valuable commodity in a world of media-trained personalities and music dictated by the metrics of streaming services, and it’s something Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared? has in abundance. Far less aesthetically cohesive than Monomania or Fading Frontier, it never settles, skipping without warning from harpsichord-bedecked psych-pop to icy Tubeway Army-ish synth instrumentals, from elegiac alt-rock ballads to stuff that sounds like a lo-fi take on 80s Japanese environmental music, its disparate strands just about held together by Cox’s drawling voice and the hazy quality of the production.Much has been made of the fact that it was partly recorded in the sparsely populated Texan desert city of Marfa, and it’s not hard to work out how the environment influenced its sound: there’s a layer of echo suggestive of distance and empty space, while the rhythms have something of the sandstorm about them, distorted and gritty. Moreover, if there are moments where the album overplays its hand – a warped spoken-word track titled Detournement perhaps lays it on a bit thick – there’s a confidence about its stylistic leaps that means it feels like the expression of an authentically idiosyncratic imagination rather than someone being weird and eclectic for the sake of it.The lyrics are similarly scattered: if the title somehow suggests another despairing broadside against the evils of Trump’s America from the US alt-rock fraternity, the reality is more intriguing and complex. You could certainly ine the overall mood of prickly unease and the references to pollution and toxicity in Element as having some basis in America’s current upheavals: “may God’s will be done in these poisoned hills and let the devil be cast out on his tail,” snaps opener Death in Midsummer, in the language of the Christian right. But they come amid a gush of disparate and fascinating ideas: Futurism rails against nostalgia as a “cage”, Plains depicts James Dean filming Giant in Marfa, the town’s isolation filling him with foreboding.Indeed, the most expressly political thing here refers not to America, but the UK. No One’s Sleeping is an anguished response to the murder of MP Jo Cox, viewed from across the Atlantic. The music carries a distinct echo of the acoustic guitar-driven sound found on the Kinks’ Days or Picture Book the lyrics mention village greens fading into darkness. It’s as if a stylised, quaint, distant view of England learned through Ray Davies’ songs is warping and fracturing. It is unexpected and strange, and, like the rest of the album, beautifully done.Phil Cordell: LondonderryExcavated on Ace’s superb forthcoming compilation Three Day Week, a bizarre, haunting attempt to turn the Troubles into echoing, glammy pop: musical archeology at its most compelling.• Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared? is released on 18 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0505c9b63edf2f40f7bb5fa0e0690384dd7539/0_44_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c37363ebe40b05cbaa312ad731bfc285","title":"lady gaga apologises for working with r kelly i stand behind these women 1000","story":"The singer intends to remove the 2013 duet with the embattled singer, Do What U Want, from download and streaming servicesLady Gaga has apologised for working with R Kelly.Kelly has been accused by numerous women of violent and controlling behaviour, including keeping them, some while under the age of consent, in what’s been described as a “sex cult”. A documentary, Surviving R Kelly, features testimonies from a number of the women. Yesterday, it was reported that new abuse investigations were being launched by prosecutors in Chicago and Atlanta.Kelly has denied any wrongdoing, and last year recorded a song professing his innocence, on which he sings: “I’m so falsely accused.”In 2013, Gaga recorded the duet Do What U Want with Kelly. She has now apologised for working with him, saying: “I’m sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young, and for not speaking out sooner.” She intends to remove the songs from download and streaming services.Gaga says she wrote the song, whose chorus line runs, “You can’t have my heart and you won’t use my mind but  do what you want with my body”, was intended to “create something extremely defiant and provocative, because I was angry and still hadn’t processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life”, referring to a sexual assault that she suffered. She describes her thinking at the time as “explicitly twisted” and a “confused posttraumatic state”.Soul singer John Legend did appear in the documentary, later tweeting: “To everyone telling me how courageous I am for appearing in the doc, it didn’t feel risky at all … Easy decision.”Chance the Rapper also appeared in the documentary, saying: “We’re programmed to really be hypersensitive to black male oppression” as a reason many chose to give Kelly the benefit of the doubt.

He’s recorded Mozart piano concertos with both the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, but south of the border at least he has only appeared occasionally in that dual role. One of those few exceptions was a concert at the Barbican with the SCO almost 11 years ago, when coincidentally Anderszewski played the same pair of concertos that he presented here with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Haydn’s D major Piano Concerto, and Beethoven’s First Concerto in C.Clearly, then, he feels these two particular concertos go well together, and certainly his performance of the Haydn transformed it from a standard example of 18th-century classicism into a piece of engaging elegance and wit that stood up well alongside the convention-busting exuberance of early Beethoven. His typically crisp rhythms and clean, crystalline sound gave it buoyancy and sparkling vitality, which the CBSO seemed delighted to follow. The solo playing in the Beethoven was just as poised and controlled, but the effect was far grander and more imposing, even wild in the finale, so that it seemed to come from a different world altogether, far away from the Mozart piano concerto in the same key, K503, which seems to have served as Beethoven’s model.There was also some Mozart between the Haydn and Beethoven, the G minor symphony K550. As in the concerto performances, there were no concessions to period-performance niceties, and Anderszewski’s conducting technique seemed to rely a lot on enthusiasm and sheer commitment, but his characteristic clarity and surging energy were certainly conveyed in the CBSO’s playing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dfb18c1b4ac2eda05e2413c62cddec04130eaa4/0_147_4423_2654/master/4423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e07e7d263ddf41f19e60c579e3f5fcf","title":"deal or no deal where next brexit today in focus podcast","story":"As Theresa May prepares for the showdown Brexit vote on Tuesday, the government is stepping up its contingency planning for crashing out of the EU without a deal. ’s Patrick Wintour sets out the routes available to the government as the exit date fast approaches.

It’s time to go back to the people, 9 January) pinpoints many issues as to why the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, but then perversely creates the wrong solution to the clear and decisive voice of the British people.The dispossessed were given a voice as the sovereignty of parliament was transferred to its citizens via a referendum. The UK has respected every decision of every referendum in the past. Our remain top-heavy parliament is creating difficulties for itself the answer is to listen more carefully to the people and not to ask the people to speak more clearly.Your call for humility on behalf of those who failed to hear the people’s cry is not best displayed by not fulfilling the instructions of those very same people who we recognise have had enough. wants to see a reformed UK in a reformed EU, but it is evident that the EU is not for reforming other than to continue its repetitive march towards the United States of Europe that you say you do not want. The EU is simply not for turning away from closer integration on finances, foreign policy, defence structures and ever closer integration as it engineers the tools that in the end create our ultimate governance from a remote, undemocratic, elitist Brussels. It failed to heed the overtures from David Cameron in 2016, and it is on broadcast mode only as we try to negotiate our withdrawal from its institutions. too is on broadcast mode. We must respect our own tools of democracy, and simply because parliament is in contempt of the people is not sufficient reason to further enrage those who have spoken to ask for greater clarity on what they meant when they said “enough” of this project.Entrepreneur and international hotelier Rocco Forte, writing on the same day in another publication, writes lucidly about the strengths of the UK economy and its significant standing in the world. He is confident about the steps that need to be taken to deliver on the vote and our continued and expansive role with the rest of the world. He points out that the EU sold £341bn of goods to us last year and the leverage that our £95bn deficit with the EU gives us if only we used it.So instead of dressing up our disappointment in the result of the people’s vote of 2016, and pretending that failing to listen to its call is ultimately nothing other than Orwellian doublespeak, let us embrace the opportunities that have been offered by the boldness and astuteness of our ultimate bosses: the people. To deny them their Brexit would certainly be the worst of all worlds and would most certainly put us in uncharted waters – and the repercussions of that would be dire.Nigel Evans MPConservative, Ribble Valley• Your leader makes good points, but is once again based on the assertion, also maintained in the past by the Observer, that the referendum result was valid – “We accepted, without enthusiasm, that leave had won”. Thanks largely to the investigative reporting for which the Scott Trust is revered and supported, we know that a number of factors subverted the referendum. Several of these abuses were claimed, indeed claimed by the perpetrators themselves, to have swung the narrow result the fact that they did so when added together must now be almost certain. At the very least they render the result unsafe as a premise upon which to decide the fate of our nation.Surely the  and the Observer should change their stance on this vital issue in the light of the evidence to which they have themselves contributed with such distinction. Then we will have more hope that our elected representatives will change their stance as well.James WillisAlton, Hampshire• Your editorial on Brexit omits to mention a key factor that is used to argue against a second referendum – that to hold one would disrespect the democratic will of the people. Such a view ignores two glaringly obvious facts. One, the leave majority was extremely slim and therefore cannot be considered to represent a single “will of the people”. Two, democracy was gloriously disrespected by those who made promises that have turned out to be fanciful at best and blatant falsehoods at worst. Now that the people have seen enough evidence upon which to base their rational judgment, their democratic right to express it must be restored.Dr Allan DoddsBramcote, Nottinghamshire• Your leading article supports some mechanism such as that used recently in Ireland. This is potentially crucial for the future of this country in two particular ways. First, it addresses the basic question of who is fitted to guide our country’s policy, and brings in the principle of randomness. Random selection applies no filters: not gender, not race, not education, not class, not wealth, not family connection. It therefore is revolutionary in, at last, assuming equal citizenship. Who owns the country? All its citizenry.Second, the mechanism includes study of the issues. It brings together a number of citizens small enough over a reasonable period of time to become well informed on the principles and technicalities involved. It is not a marketing campaign, but an educational enterprise. I rejoice.Howard HiltonAudlem, Cheshire• Your front page (9 January) carried these messages, in an extract from your editorial: 1) “The message must be that this country needs a new and fairer deal” I believe that is true 2) “and that this is best guaranteed by a better Britain in a better Europe.” I believe that is true 3) “The government has failed” I believe that is true 4) “… so we must go back to the people.” If that means a second referendum, I believe that is not true.The 2016 referendum was ill conceived by a government desperate to dig itself out of a hole, Is that different now? It was badly executed. The wrong question was asked of the wrong electorate at the wrong time. Would that be different now? It was intended as advisory but treated as binding. Is that different now? If you aren’t convinced yet, perhaps you watched the film Brexit which showed an eminently repeatable set of events. So what should happen?I believe that parliament, the ultimate law-making body in the UK, should revoke its article 50 notice, so prematurely sent, and the whole sorry mess would end. Government response to the question “Can article 50 be revoked?” has been: “It’s not government policy”. Presumably that means “yes”. So, that’s what we should do now. And later, when the dust has settled, have a real people’s vote in a general election.Celia WilsonDidcot, Oxfordshire• Your editorial suggests that it is time to take the matter of Brexit out of parliament and back to the people. I agree. However, you appear to avoid calling for the traditional mechanism of a general election and instead suggest a somewhat convoluted process of a citizens’ assembly followed at some point by a reconfigured second referendum. The problem is that if the discussion takes place in the same climate as we currently have, the conclusion is likely to be much the same. That’s why I, and no doubt other  readers, will be gathering at Portland Place in London on Saturday to join the people’s assembly march. It will call for the much-heralded end to austerity to actually happen and challenge the rise of racism. Both of these are essential prerequisites for a more a rational Brexit debate.Keith FlettLondon• The issue should be decided by intelligent, well-informed people from across the political and cultural spectrum of parliament. If their decision reverses Brexit and attracts the ire of vehement Brexiters, so be it. It won’t be the first time parliament has ignored the so-called public will.Michael HeatonWarminster, Wiltshire• For once, a leading article that leads: thank you.

Most MPs, across the house, including many in government, would not countenance leaving on 29 March with no agreement,” he wrote.As Clark was being interviewed, his backbench colleague Sarah Wollaston told BBC Breakfast she would resign the Tory whip if there were no deal.Clark was also asked on Today to repeat the government’s mantra that no deal was better than a bad deal. He refused, and claimed the current withdrawal agreement was a “good deal”. But he appeared to accept that MPs would need more assurances before it was passed in parliament.“There is a substantial majority that absolutely does not want to see no deal. If people look at the deal that has been negotiated, sure there will be some reassurances that some colleagues need, there will be some amendments that have been proposed on our side, including what has been suggested today on workers’ rights,” he said.“Given that we’ve got that deal, it is my strong view that we need to come together now, we need to act to avoid no deal because I don’t think there is remotely like a majority in parliament that will tolerate that.”Asked why the government could not rule out a no-deal Brexit, Clark said: “The default is in law that unless we have a deal, we will fall into no deal. Now is the time for parliament to recognise that we need to come together.”He cited news that Jaguar Land Rover may cut 5,000 jobs as an example of why business would suffer if there were no agreement.Earlier, the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, said Labour was wary of reports of government offers on workers’ rights.“When it comes to the crunch, I don’t trust the Conservatives on workers’ rights. The problem is that even the noises that are being made in the press by the Conservatives don’t mean that any such agreement would be legally binding when it comes to protecting workers’ rights,” he told Today.Burgon said Labour would need more concessions before it backed the withdrawal agreement in next week’s vote. “Workers’ rights is an important part but only one part of the deal that we’d be proposing. There is also the matter of a permanent customs union and a strong single market relationship, both to protect jobs,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18eb73d87a12c4d57c0bea5fbd6bf51d595fe2f9/0_271_3132_1880/master/3132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9abdcdad7e06e57869b1f953dfff40e","title":"brexit latest news corbyn speech may press conference reaches out to labour by welcoming workers rights amendment politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit speech, Theresa May’s press conference, and day two of the resumed Brexit debateJeremy Corbyn is often described as a lifelong Eurosceptic. That is not wrong, but it does not fully explain Corbyn’s stance on Brexit because another point is that he is not hugely interested in the topic either. The issues that engage him are ones like poverty and human rights. All of this helps to explain why his speech on Brexit this morning was, in certain respects, something of a non-event. In relation to some questions - like when will Labour table a confidence motion, or would Labour extend article 50? - we almost ended up knowing less about Labour’s position after the speech than we did before.But even politicians’ evasions can be interesting. And, on the plus side, the speech did reflect Corbyn’s determination to move beyond Brexit. There was an argument in it. Here are the main points from the speech and the Q\u0026ampAMany Tory MPs have said they would vote against May’s Brexit deal, but support her government in a confidence motion. There are two scenarios where it becomes possible to imagine Labour winning if MPs voted for the deal including the Irish backstop, leading the DUP to conclude that voting with Labour to bring down the government was the only way it can kill the backstop or if May committed to a no-deal Brexit, leading Tory pro-Europeans to conclude that voting with Labour to bring down their own government was the only way to stop that happening. Either of these situations could arise, but probably not next week.The truth is, the real ide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU and those who voted to leave. It is between the many – who do the work, who create the wealth and pay their taxes, and the few – who set the rules, who reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes ...People across the country, whether they voted leave or remain know that the system isn’t working for them.Some see the EU as a defence against insecurity and hostility. Others see the EU as part of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility in the first place.But it’s the failed system rigged against the many to protect the interests of the few that is the real cause of inequality and insecurity whether it’s in Tottenham or Mansfield ...Because for both sides the EU referendum was about much more than our relationship with our biggest trading partner and its rules.It was about what has happened to our people over decades and how to build a better future.But the problem with this argument is that it runs counter to the wealth of academic evidence saying that identity politics is growing increasingly powerful, and the remainleave ide (and the values split that it represents) is what matters. You can find a library of research on this topic here. Depicting politics as a conflict between the many and the few implies a class analysis of voting behaviour. But class is no longer the factor that determines how people vote age is far more important (among other things), as these two charts from a YouGov analysis of the 2017 general election show. There is nothing wrong at all with Corbyn’s desire to reset the terms of engagement, but he faces a very tough challenge.Quite clearly, moving into office at a period right up against the clock, there would need to be time for that negotiation,. What Keir was doing was reflecting the practicalities of how that negotiation would be undertaken.It’s already been quite clearly and emphatically rejected by the TUC and leading trade unions. They say it simply doesn’t guarantee the protections that we are seeking. We don’t endorse or accept what has been put forward and we agree with the TUC and the other general secretaries who have already rejected that view.It was not surprising that Corbyn is not impressed by the amendment, because in practical terms it would not have much of an effect. What is really interesting is the contrast with Corbyn’s conference speech. In Liverpool in September Corbyn made a point of saying in his speech that, if May could produce a Brexit deal that matched Labour’s terms, he would support it. But today there was no offer to cooperate with May over Brexit. Corbyn also did not say anything about working with Tory backbenchers to produce an alternative Brexit plan. In the Commons yesterday Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister, asked Starmer specifically if Labour would be willing to cooperate with government backbenchers like himself on some sort of Norway option. There was nothing in today’s speech to suggest that Corbyn is interested in taking up this offer.Nicola Blackwood, a former Conservative MP has been appointed as a health minister and made a life peer, Downing Street has announced. She will replace Lord O’Shaughnessy as health minister after he resigned in December citing “family circumstances”. Blackwood was a health minister until she lost her Oxford West and Abingdon seat in the 2017 general election.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy premier, has denied meddling in UK politics, insisting he has an obligation to challenge those “misrepresenting” what the Brexit deal contains. Although his comments about the importance of the Irish backstop have frequently angered Tory Brexiters, Coveney told BBC Radio Ulster that he was not interfering in British politics. He said:I am not trying to meddle, I’m trying to be a candid friend. There isn’t an anti-British or English bone in my body, but I believe I have an obligation in the context of the relationships between these two islands and on this island, north and south, to try to find a solution that can allow us all to live together in peace, that allows us to trade together and live normal lives as neighbours together. Some people are choosing, in my view, to misrepresent what that deal is about for the future, particularly for Northern Ireland, and I need to speak up on that - I wouldn’t be fulfilling my obligations if I didn’t.In the Commons earlier John Bercow, the speaker, clashed with Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, over his decision yesterday to defy precedent and allow a vote on a procedural amendment tabled by the anti-Brexit Tory Dominic Grieve.Leadsom, a Brexiter, told MPs this morning that the speaker’s job was to “uphold the rules that parliament has made for itself, not to arbitrarily change those rules”. There was nothing arbitrary about the conduct of the chair yesterday. This speaker is well aware of how to go about the business of chairing the proceedings of the House because he’s been doing so for nine and a half years. I hope colleagues will understand when I say that I require no lessons or lectures from others about how to discharge my obligations to parliament and in support of the rights of backbench parliamentarians.I have been doing it, I’m continuing to do it and I will go on doing it, no matter how much abuse I get from whatever quarter. It’s water off a duck’s back as far as I am concerned.Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit speech.Here is some Twitter comment on the Corbyn Brexit speech from journalists.From the BBC’s Norman SmithFrom the Times’ Sam CoatesFrom my colleague Jessica ElgotFrom the Observer’s Michael SavageFrom the Daily Mirror’s Pippa CrerarMeanwhile, my colleague Dan Sabbagh has posted this from the Downing Street lobby briefing.Q: Many Labour members want the party to promise a second referendum if there is an election. Do you have reservations about that?Corbyn says at the Labour conference the party adopted a sequential policy, calling for a vote against May’s vote, then a general election, and if that can’t happen potentially a popular vote.Corbyn says he is very aware of how young people want free higher education, and access to training and jobs. He understands what they feel about remain. But he also understands the views of those who voted leave. His speech today was about how you can bring the country together. The government’s policies will not do that.He says Labour will vote against May’s deal on Tuesday. It will then, if it is successful, be calling for a general election, he says.He says he does not want to live in a country where people rely on food banks. He wants to live in a country that cares for people. I will post a summary soon.Corbyn says accepting May’s deal would lock the UK into a process that would not be a good one.Q: Will you call a no confidence vote next week?Corbyn says the vote next week could be the third defeat for the government in a week. This is a government that cannot command a majority in the Commons. Labour will move a no confidence motion “at a time of our choosing”, when it judges there is best chance of success, he says.This chaos cannot go on, he says. The only way out is a general election.Q: Is there a split between you and Starmer on this over extending article 50?No, says Corbyn. He repeats the point about how what Starmer said about extending article 50 yesterday just reflected the practicalities.Corbyn is now taking questions.Q: If you do get a general election, what will Labour’s Brexit policy be?Corbyn says the policy will be one of negotiating around a customs union, and not allowing workers’ rights to fall below EU standards. That is implicit in the government’s policy. Labour would want to negotiate with the EU urgently. But the party would make election policy in a democratic way.Q: Do you back the Mann amendment on workers’ rights? And is there anything Theresa May could offer that would make you support her deal?Corbyn says what has been offered by the government does not go far enough on workers’ rights. Labour does not accept what has been put forward. It agrees with what the TUC and other unions are saying.Q: Do you agree with Keir Starmer that extending article 50 may be inevitable.Starmer says if Labour took office, there would have to be a renegotiation. Starmer was reflecting the practicalities of this.Corbyn is now winding up.The Conservatives are never going to tackle the burning injustices in our country or act to overcome the deep and growing inequalities.They are incapable of leading us out of a crisis they created.Britain deserves a government that can govern.The need for a government with a clear purpose and direction for the country could not be more urgent.A general election is the right answer and the best way to break the deadlock.Labour is ready to bring Leave and Remain voters together to rebuild Britain for the many not the few."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a1dd4fa90122c6719be7ef245a33a417f3aadac/0_150_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c0088c746445a9a8d8e5134d7a2bc2","title":"flat earth cruise nautical navigation","story":"Flat earthers, who believe the Earth is a large disk, may be shocked to find the ship’s navigation is based on a spherical planetA group of people who believe the Earth is flat have announced their “biggest, boldest, best adventure yet”: a Flat Earth cruise scheduled for 2020.The cruise, organized by the Flat Earth International Conference, promises to be a lovely time. Flat earthers – who include the rapper B.o.B. and reality television person Tila Tequila – will be able to enjoy restaurants, swimming pools and perhaps even an artificial surf wave.There’s just one problem for those seeking to celebrate the flatness of the Earth. The navigational systems cruise ships, and other vessels, use rely on the fact that the Earth is not flat: theoretically puncturing the beliefs of the flat Earth crowd.“Ships navigate based on the principle that the Earth is round,” said Henk Keijer, a former cruise ship captain who sailed all over the globe during a 23-year career.“Nautical charts are designed with that in mind: that the Earth is round.”Keijer, who now works as a forensic marine expert for Robson Forensic, said the existence of GPS, the global positioning system, alone is proof that the Earth is a sphere, not a flat disc. GPS relies on 24 main satellites which orbit the Earth to provide positional and navigational information.“The reason why 24 satellites were used is because on the curvature of the Earth,” Keijer said.“A minimum of three satellites are required to determine a position. But someone located on the other side of the Earth would also like to know their position, so they also require a certain number of satellites.“Had the Earth been flat, a total of three satellites would have been enough to provide this information to everyone on Earth. But it is not enough, because the Earth is round.”While there are different theories within the Flat Earth community, the core belief is the Earth is flat. The FEIC claims that after “extensive experimentation, analysis, and research”, its adherents came to believe the Earth is not a sphere.A common model offered for the exact topography of the Earth is that it is a large disk, surrounded by “an ice wall barrier” – Antarctica.The Flat Earth Society, which is not connected to the FEIC, has suggested that “the space agencies of the world” have conspired to fake “space travel and exploration”.“This likely began during the Cold War,” the Flat Earth Society says.“The USSR and USA were obsessed with beating each other into space to the point that each faked their accomplishments in an attempt to keep pace with the other’s supposed achievements,” the Flat Earth Society says.The FEIC did not respond to requests for more information on the Flat Earth cruise. The organization could potentially try to staff the cruise ship with a crew which does not think the Earth is round, but Keijer said that would be difficult.“I have sailed two million miles, give or take,” Keijer said.“I have not encountered one sea captain who believes the Earth is flat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc5cfc2e9fffcc6f68dd11faaac6259b7778ca4/0_191_4751_2850/master/4751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d0f8fb122f059a82c221f080c40f055","title":"mattia binotto ferrari f1","story":"Ferrari’s new team principal has just five weeks before testing in Barcelona but his appointment is perhaps the best they have made in recent yearsPrecious little time remains for the new Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto to grasp the reins of his singularly demanding prancing horse. Having been chosen to replace Maurizio Arrivabene on Monday, it is just five weeks before Formula One hits the ground running at the first test in Barcelona.Nor is that his only concern, he takes on the most high-profile management role in the sport, under intense scrutiny and demanding the greatest results. A task compounded by inheriting a Scuderia that has been unruly, skittish and left once more licking its wounds after defeat last season. Yet Ferrari’s decision to go with Binotto was positive and bold, perhaps it is the best they have made in recent years.Arrivabene’s dismissal in favour of Binotto represents a new start for the team and one it seems that will be roundly welcomed. Arrivabene has been in charge since 2014, he was the third team principal since Jean Todt stepped down at the end of 2007, since which they have won the constructors championship only once, in 2008.Arrivabene’s background was as a marketing executive with tobacco company Philip Morris, dealing closely with the team through their long commercial relationship. He was not a racer but knew the F1 world and was expected to be able to manage it well. His removal reflects failure in that regard as his team proved unable to really challenge Mercedes for the past two seasons despite largely having the car to do so.He brought a bunker mentality to the team, seen most clearly in a reluctance to deal with the media and an often combative and aggressive or incommunicative style when forced to do so by FIA requirements to attend press conferences. The atmosphere in the team reportedly reflected this in an intimidatory, critical culture, intensified by the pressure they were under. Sebastian Vettel made several costly mistakes in 2018 but that he was unhappy with some team decisions, albeit behind closed doors, was clear and just how well he was being handled must be questioned.The Japanese Grand Prix last year could not have illustrated the contrast with the all-conquering Mercedes better. Their team principal, Toto Wolff, who engages with the media with remarkable openness, spoke honestly on the care with which he had to manage Lewis Hamilton and how his team had pulled together to turn their season around. After a difficult weekend at Spa he revealed he had sent a message to his staff urging them on to greater efforts, stressing teamwork in “analysis, mindset, work ethic, and fun”. By Suzuka it had made the difference and they were firmly ahead.Ferrari had already made team order errors in Germany and Italy and after a poor strategy call on tyres in qualifying in Japan cost the team, Arrivabene turned on his own. “What happened today is unacceptable,” he said. “I am very angry. It is not the first time that these mistakes have occurred. I do not feel like pointing my fingers at someone in particular, but I’m very disappointed.” Finger pointing it seems is almost certain to have occurred in private but regardless such vituperative statements could not be further from Wolff and Mercedes’s philosophy.After Hamilton had taken pole for the race, Wolff was emphatic about one of the reasons behind their continued success that now stretches to five consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ championships. “What we’ve tried to establish is a safe environment which is easier said than done,” he said. “There is a lot of pressure, but we are trying to channel it in a positive way.”The culture they have established is inarguably working. Binotto has the pedigree to instil a similar atmosphere within Ferrari. The 49-year-old has a firm background in engineering and even more importantly with Ferrari. He joined the team in 1995 and has since gone through the ranks in a variety of roles. Put in charge of the power unit after a disastrous season in 2014 his management was crucial in improving its performance – such that it is now arguably the best on the grid – and beginning the Scuderia’s return to challenge for the title. He took over as chief technical officer, the head of car design in 2016 and for the past two years Ferrari have been resurgent.In both key areas, engine and design, he has proved able to manage teams cohesively and successfully. He has placed trust in his staff, allowing them to think creatively, while ensuring they work collectively for common goals. This positive approach has paid great idends, there is every reason to believe similar can only benefit the team as a whole.Ferrari, as with any team, is a complex construction of iniduals, that needs to be finely tuned. Management and motivation can be every bit as important as any inspirational drive or design. Where Arrivabene proved unable to coerce his team into success, Binotto, a racer in the Ross Brawn mould, has the credentials to build a Scuderia that dances to a much more harmonious tune.McLaren have hired Andreas Seidl as the new boss of their Formula One operation in a bid to revive the British team’s waning fortunes. Seidl, who has worked in F1 for BMW and more recently as team principal for Porsche in the World Endurance Championship, is one of a number of senior changes by the team in recent times.Seidl joins McLaren as managing director and becomes the face of their F1 operation. He will report to American chief executive, Zak Brown. It is unclear, however, if Seidl will be in place for the season-opener in Melbourne on 17 March, as McLaren have not reached an agreement with Porsche on his start date. McLaren, Britain’s most successful F1 team, have failed to win a race in more than six years, and are in the midst of the worst run in their long history.

As long as he could survive 30 days in the dark with no human contactThree – or was it four? – days after he shut himself in a pitch-black bathroom, Rich Alati started to hallucinate. He saw little white, bubble-like balls, floating around the room. To calm himself he imagined he was in a magical cloud, cozy and relaxed. Embracing the visions was key. “Or else,” he says, “you might get a little scared.”Alati was in the dark for a bet, which makes a little more sense once you know he is a professional poker player. On 10 September last year, the American was sitting at a poker table at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, when he was asked a question by a fellow professional player, Rory Young: how much would it take for him to spend time in complete isolation, with no light, for 30 days? An hour later a price had been agreed: $100,000.Young would hand over the money if Alati could last 30 days in a soundproofed bathroom with no light. He would be delivered food from a local restaurant, but the meals would come at irregular intervals to prevent him from keeping track of time. There would be no TV, radio, phone or access to the outside world but he would be allowed some comforts: a yoga mat, resistance band, massage ball, and, appropriately for a bathroom, lavender essential oils as well as a sugar and salt scrub. If Alati failed he would have to pay Young $100,000.Poker players are known to bet on just about anything but some thought Alati had taken things too far. “I wouldn’t do this bet for any amount of money,” professional poker player Danielle Moon Anderson noted at the time. Dr Michael Munro, a psychologist Young consulted before agreeing to the bet, told Young: “Even if he lasts for 30 days, it will be extremely taxing on his mental health for the short and potentially long term.”There’s good reason for such caution. Solitary confinement is often used as punishment, most notably in the United States, where inmates in solitary are isolated in their cells 23 hours a day. The United Nations’ Nelson Mandela Rules state that keeping someone in solitary for more than 15 days constitutes torture.Dr Terry Kupers, a psychiatrist at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, says the bet risked trivializing solitary confinement. “Anxiety, anger and despair, often with a high risk of suicide, is the average clinical presentation of prisoners in solitary,” he says.While there would be notable differences between Alati’s experiences and those of a prisoner in solitary – most notably, he could leave at any time – Young believed the American was unlikely to last the 30 days. “It’s just so cruel to the human mind to do that,” he says.But Alati was confident. He had practiced meditation and yoga, and was certain his experiences at silent retreats would help him. On 21 November, a crowd of families and friends gathered at the house where the challenge would take place. Alati and Young’s lawyers were there as well as cameramen from a production company interested in buying television rights to the story. For that reason, as well as safety, the entire bet would be recorded. Alati’s father was given the power to pull Alati out at any time should he show signs of not being “in the right headspace,” as Alati puts it.At 8.05pm, Alati walked into the bathroom, and darkness fell. He stood for a moment, frozen. Then he lay down and fell asleep.The bathroom mirrors were covered to prevent any reflection, and the doors, though unlocked, were sealed to block out any light. A mattress was wedged between the sink and a countertop. In front of the sink and next to the mattress was Alati’s yoga mat. And across from that was the bathtub.“My memory is really good,” Alati says. He had examined the room before the challenge started, and when he woke up in complete darkness, he could picture his surroundings. He told himself that he should do what he normally does when he wakes up, and began his routine.He brushed his teeth. He then filled up the bathtub, adding Epsom salts and lavender oil to calm his mind, and scoured himself with the sugar and salt scrub. From the bath, he went to the shower in the corner of the room to rinse off. He then headed to the sink, where he used Q-tips on his ears, combed his hair, and lotioned his body. He got dressed and ate. He did yoga and meditated. “I was remembering where everything is, and everything goes back to that exact place,” Alati says. “That’s how I live my life anyways.”And that was his plan. He was going to live his normal life as if normal “was living in darkness for the rest of my life.” He had 720 hours and absolutely no distractions – and he’d use that time to improve himself. “How can I give myself a better sugar scrub ... how can I stretch it deeper, how can I be more calm, how can I be more patient?” he says.From the outside his life was, well, a little dull. Young, who had began watching the video stream in earnest, said “it became a bit boring after a while because it’s not like he’s doing anything different.”The biggest hurdles were mental. As well as the hallucinations, his thoughts twice started to spiral negatively, fast. “It happened so quick. It went from positive thoughts to like what if, what if, what if?” Alati says. Such thoughts were dangerous without company to distract him. In isolation, they could lead to despair. When they cropped up, Alati started doing yoga, and he refocused on his body, on his pose and stretch.Some parts were easier. With so much time and only himself for company, Alati’s thoughts were a source of entertainment and a lifeline. “The thoughts would just come to you, and if you don’t make sure that they go in a good direction, they can spiderweb out of control and lead you to a bad place,” Alati says.Around the 10-day mark, Young started to worry that Alati might make the 30 days, noting he looked “totally fine”. He worried he had miscalculated: Young hadn’t known Alati – a gregarious, fast talker – for long before they had made the bet. “His personality did not reflect that of someone who was proficient with meditation,” Young said.On day 15, Young’s voice came on over the loudspeaker. Alati jumped out of bed, happy to hear a voice that wasn’t his own. Young told Alati that he had been in for around two weeks and that he had an offer for him: Alati could leave if he paid out $50,000.Alati’s laughed in disbelief. “You can’t be serious,” Alati recalls telling Young. “Dude, I just sat in here for two weeks, and you want me to hand over half my money?” He laid back down discouraged. He’d spent 15 long days in the bathroom – “no walk in the park” in his words – and he had to gear up for 15 more.“It was a pretty aggressive negotiation tactic by me,” Young concedes. He waited a few days and came back with another offer. Alati was skeptical. “I don’t know, kid, your buyout offers are trash,” Alati recalls telling Young. Young offered to pay Alati $25,000 to come out. The money was finally in Alati’s favor. He considered the offer for an hour – and then declined.Alati waited for a few days until Young came back on the loudspeaker and asked if he had any offers of his own. Alati said he wouldn’t come out for less than $75,000, to which Young countered with an offer of $40,000. They settled on $62,400. Alati had had been in the silence and dark for 20 days.Young was relieved. He had come to a gradual realization that he hadn’t given enough weight to the fact that Alati was there by choice. “So if you’re in solitary confinement in prison, that’s a scary situation. You don’t know if you’re going to get out ever,” he said. “Here, if he lasts, he gets 100k, but these guys in solitary confinement get nothing – they have to do that.”Kupers says that distinction – “remembering why he is there, that it is not permanent” – is crucial. “Prisoners in solitary confinement tell me they are afraid they will never be released and they will die in solitary.”Alati was ready to leave the bathroom. He put on eclipse sunglasses, which blocked out any light, to protect his eyes. When he finally emerged, the noise and commotion was overwhelming. He was handed a phone, and Alati looked at it for a moment, remembering that life existed with phones and technology, before he began speaking into it. It was his sister.Friends and family surrounded him, and social interaction was “a bit of a culture shock”. He was surprised by the number of choices he had and that social niceties needed to be observed. “I knew how to do everything – I just forgot,” Alati says. “I can’t just start doing push-ups on a bathtub in front of people. I can’t just start walking around with no underwear.”Despite paying out $62,400, Young is happy he took the bet. “I think it is a good story of when two people want to test whether they can do something, they do it in a fair environment and can work together, and even though one of us lost a sizable chunk of money, we both feel great about it.”Alati says he is happy, too. He hopes his story serves as a positive for others about overcoming challenges in a world of bad news. He says he has learned to value patience and things we take for granted, like chairs, tables and lamps or simply being outside. “We truly go about our day to day and put up these blinders because there’s so much distraction, but if you just look at the world with a different perspective and just see it, this is something,” he says. “This is really something.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4251bc8c6a86a818a3b63b9256cf0003aba663ce/0_322_6562_3938/master/6562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a8288dbac3969468ce418869832738f","title":"vatican announces athletics team olympics italian olympic committee","story":"• Vatican Athletics has blessing of Italian Olympic Committee• Priests, nuns and 62-year-old library worker among membersThe Vatican has launched an athletics team with the aim of competing in international competitions – including the Olympics – as part of an agreement signed with the Italian Olympic Committee (Coni).About 60 Holy See runners – Swiss Guards, priests, nuns, pharmacists and a 62-year-old professor who works in the Vatican’s Apostolic Library – are the first accredited members of Vatican Athletics. It is the latest iteration of the Holy See’s longstanding promotion of sport as an instrument of dialogue, peace and solidarity.Because of the agreement with Coni, the team is now a part of the Italian track association and is looking to join the International Association of Athletics Federations. It is hoping to compete in international competitions, including the Games of the Small States of Europe – open to states with fewer than 1 million people – and the Mediterranean Games. The Vatican aims to sign similar agreements with the Italian Paralympic committee.“The dream that we have often had is to see the Holy See flag among the delegations at the opening of the Olympic Games,” said Monsignor Melchor Jose Sánchez de Toca y Alameda, team president and the head of the Vatican’s sports department in the culture ministry. He said that was neither a short-term nor medium-term goal, and that for now the Vatican was looking to participate in competitions that had cultural or symbolic value. “We might even podium,” he added.Team members wearing navy warm-up suits bearing the Holy See’s crossed keys seal attended the launch. Vatican pharmacist-runner Michela Ciprietti told a press conference the aim of the team is not exclusively competitive, but rather to “promote culture and running and launch the message of solidarity and the fight against racism and violence of all types”.Coni president Giovanni Malago welcomed the birth of the Vatican team, even though he acknowledged it might one day deprive Italy of a medal. However he joked to Vatican officials: “Just don’t get too big.”In recent years, the Vatican has fielded unofficial football teams and a cricket team that has helped forge relations with the Anglican church through annual tours in Britain. The track team, however, is the first one to have a legal status in Vatican City and to be an official part of the Italian sporting umbrella, able to compete in nationally and internationally sanctioned events and take advantage of the Italian national coaching, scientific and medical resources.Vatican Athletics’ first official outing is the La Corsa di Miguel on 20 January, a 10km race in Rome honouring Miguel Sánchez, an Argentine distance runner who was one of the thousands of young people who “disappeared” during the country’s Dirty War. The choice is significant: Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was a young Jesuit superior in Argentina during the military dictatorship’s crackdown on alleged leftist dissidents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26de8b36dd63321b24862abbdd41384e3c30e544/0_0_3483_2090/master/3483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4069ee655e8c583c51188ce32c8ae6fd","title":"amazon echo dot review 3rd gen 2018 alexa smart speaker","story":"Latest small smart speaker has improved looks, sound and still has everything good about AlexaAmazon’s latest low-cost Alexa-powered smart speaker, the third-generation Echo Dot, looks better, sounds better, but still costs the same budget-friendly £50.When the second-generation Echo Dot launched in the UK it had very little in the way of competition.

It won’t beat larger speakers, but for the money it sounds pretty good, edging out Google’s Home Mini.The mids are punchy, the highs relatively crisp and while there’s no real bass to speak of, the new Dot sounds relatively rounded for a small speaker.Feed it guitars and vocals from something like the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you’re greeted with a warm, inviting tone. Classical tracks such as Jupiter from Holst’s the Planets sound fairly rounded too. The Dot struggles with bass-driven electronica, but coped better than expected with Dr Dre’s Still D.R.E. despite its pumping bassline.The Dot can also get pretty loud, although not quite as loud as Google’s Home Mini, and the audio starts to distort in high-energy tracks at maximum volume.With smart speakers, the hardware you buy is only half the story: they live or die by the capability of the voice assistant within them.The Dot’s Alexa performance is first rate, with its four-microphone array being able to hear you over things like the cooker hood going full pelt in the kitchen or when playing music at maximum volume even if you do have to shout a bit. Alexa also sounds good through the Dot’s speakers.But where Alexa was the only game in town, it’s now a two-horse race between Alexa and Google Assistant. For most things Alexa and Assistant are on a level playing field, particularly if you’re not entirely integrated into Google’s ecosystem already.Smart home control, music playback, podcasts, news briefings, playing radio stations, setting multiple alarms, timers and various other little bits like that all work great.Alexa has a lot of third-party “skills” (apps), including those from news publishers such as the , games such as Escape the Room, utilities such as National Rail app and silly things such Star Trek – Red Alert, so you can pretend you’re on the starship Enterprise.You can change Alexa’s wake word too, which is the word it listens out for when dormant before activating. “Alexa” is the default, but options include Echo, Computer or Amazon - helpful if you have anyone called Alex in your house and want to avoid accidental activations of either the Dot or the human.Where Google’s Assistant has the edge is in interpreting speech when you mess up your questions, or when you issue multiple commands at once such as “turn off the Christmas tree and the living room lights”. Google can also answer a greater range of questions than Alexa.The new Echo Dot is a slight improvement over the old one in every way. It’s more attractive, sounds better, hears you just as well, still has a 3.5mm socket and Bluetooth audio in and out.It isn’t a patch on the larger Echo speakers, which are almost twice the price, but just about beats its closest rival, the Google Home Mini, on sound and connectivity.At £50, or frequently £30 on deals, you get a lot of smart speaker for the money with the Echo Dot. But where the original Echo Dot was a no-brainer, the decision now comes down to whether you want Alexa or Google Assistant in your tiny smart speaker, which is a much tougher call to make.Pros: can always hear you, small but loud enough, great device support, clear when muted, activity can been seen from across the room, Bluetooth, 3.5mm audio socketCons: music distorts at max volume, no real bass, general knowledge not quite as good as Google Assistant This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Most people seem to use Apple’s MacBook Pros, but I have always been a Windows user, and develop software on Windows using Visual Studio, so I am reluctant to switch to a Mac. However, every time I have tried to get a good music-making setup on Windows, I have been beset by latency problems. From what I have read online, it seems the Windows audio drivers, though improved with Windows 10, are still way behind those on MacOS.I have a Roland Duo-Capture EX and an older Novation X-Station, and I am happy to use one of these as part of my set-up, but I would like a system that is sufficiently portable to make performing with it straightforward.Finally, a touch screen would make a lot of sense for less code-based interactions – ideally one where the screen can be laid flat, such as the Lenovo Yoga series or Microsoft Surface Pro. MilesYour best bet would be to find and cultivate some of the people who compose andor perform using Windows laptops – there are some! – and ask for advice. Areas like this usually involve tacit knowledge that you only learn by doing stuff for some time, and I have not done it at all.Failing that, there are probably some websites or online communities that specialise in this topic. I didn’t find any, but people who are heavily involved in the field will know where they are. It’s another question that readers may be able to answer in the comments below …However, perhaps you should think about your overall strategy. As I understand it, you want to do everything on one laptop, which could mean taking your work machine into hazardous nightclub-style environments. This gives you the worst of both worlds.Laptops are not the best choice for sustained work such as coding, because they have poor ergonomics. You should be using a desktop – which will run faster and last longer for less money – with an ergonomic keyboard and a big screen. For the price of a MacBook Pro with a suitable specification, you could probably buy a desktop PC for programming and a second-hand MacBook for performances.Using a desktop PC would enable you to add a suitable soundcard and avoid most if not all of the Windows driver problems by using kernel streaming, or Steinberg’s ASIO (Audio Stream InputOutput) as supplied with some devices, or ASIO4ALL. Of course, you could also replace your old Roland with an external USB sound card. This should provide better audio quality with a laptop, as well as – I hope – reduce the risk of latency problems.Sam Aaron’s open source Sonic Pi program was written for the Raspberry Pi, so any PC or Mac ought to be able to run it well enough. It’s a very simple system where you specify a note just by typing a number, but it becomes very powerful when the “note” is a sample. It reminds me of the Logo language where you can loop simple instructions to create attractive patterns. I bet Terry Riley would have loved it.MaxMSP (Max Signal Processing, andor Miller Smith Puckette) from Cycling 74, which is now owned by Ableton, is a different kettle of bouillabaisse. It’s a visual programming language where you can connect objects (program routines) together to create giant data-flow diagrams.Cycling 74’s website recommends an Intel Core i5 or faster processor and 8GB or more memory for running Max 8, which “includes MSP, Jitter, Gen and support for Max for Live”. (Interestingly, the “ASIO-compatible sound card recommended for optimum audio performance” with Max 6 has been dropped.)Most DAWs (digital audio workstation programs) really require 16GB of RAM, and some work best with 32GB (Pro Tools). However, Max 8’s Jitter graphics seem to be the main challenge, and Cycling 74’s helpful user forum has at least one example of someone running Max on a tiny 4GB Core m3-based Intel Compute Stick.You haven’t mentioned a budget, but the best value MacBook option at the moment is the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a seventh-generation 2.3GHz Core i5, 8GB of memory and either 128GB (£1,249) or 256GB (£1,449) of SSD storage. A system with 16GB of memory and a 256GB SSD would therefore cost £1,629. Adding three years of AppleCare – a good idea in view of previous keyboard failures – bumps that up to £1,878.One of the major problems with current MacBook Pros is that you can’t upgrade them: you have to buy everything you will need at the beginning, and pay Apple prices. If you buy a Windows laptop, you can choose one with more configuration options that you can also upgrade later.One option I would definitely take is to upgrade the warranty to three years of on-site service for an extra £63.60. Lenovo offers up to five years on-site service for £225.60.The T480 and T480S do not have 360-degree hinges to work as tablets, but they do rotate to 180 degrees, so you can lie them flat.You can check a PC for latency problems by running Resplendence’s Latency Monitor for at least 15 minutes. This can help you identify what’s causing problems, though running SiSoftware’s Sandra Lite will provide more helpful advice for optimising your system.However, the fact is that Windows is a general-purpose program, not a real-time operating system. Leave it running long enough and it will eventually find something that, for a few milliseconds, is more important than delivering your audio bits. You can reduce the odds by not running other software, stopping non-essential background tasks, disconnecting from networks and so on, but you can’t eliminate the risk entirely.How much any transient glitches matter is another question. Only you can decide.Have you got a question?

Now, a low-tech approach to stop the killing is bearing fruit in NigeriaJohn Dalyop Dangyang hid in the toilet while the gunmen set fire to his house. As it burned down around him, he soaked his underwear in the toilet water to bind around his face against the smoke. He was trapped for seven hours before police came and broke the wall down.Two months later, homeless and traumatised, he was invited to meet the leaders of the group he blamed for his attempted murder.On the other side of the table was Idris Gidado, a powerful leader of Fulani herdsmen, the nomadic cowboys who have trodden the Sahelian countryside for centuries.At the dialogue, something extraordinary happened. After the two sides had had it out, Dangyang offered a rare commodity in this bitter feud: forgiveness.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAttacks on cattle herders by farmers and vice versa may seem trifling alongside the problems of poverty, terrorism, corruption and climate change facing Africa.But a recent escalation in this centuries-old deadly conflict is causing massive social upheaval across west Africa. In Nigeria’s middle belt, it has claimed nearly 4,000 lives in the past three years – more, according to some tallies – than the deadly Boko Haram insurgency in the north-east.Both groups need land, but for very different reasons. Fulani herding families are always on the move, looking for food and water for their animals they cannot and do not want to own the vast landscapes they pass through every year. For farmers, who live and work in one place, land ownership is essential.As families grow and grazing lands turn to fields of rice, ancient livestock migration routes close up and herders’ cattle trample farmers’ fields. Farmers kill the cattle, herdsmen take revenge the reprisals go back and forth. Ethnicity, religion and political affiliation play into the isions.Some of the suggestions to solve the crisis include fencing off fields, drilling more boreholes so cattle and humans do not have to share water, microchipping cattle to prevent rustling and mapping traditional cattle grazing routes.Cattle ranching is a more drastic route. It would necessitate a complete change in the nomadic Fulanis’ way of life, and one that requires specific expertise, expensive animal feed, access to enough water, and – that increasingly rare commodity – land. It would also mean the end of an ancient culture.Adamu Ibrahim’s family were pioneers. His father sold cows to buy land in the 1980s. These days, he owns around 10,000 cattle and is a millionaire (though you wouldn’t know it from his well-worn sandals and plain robe)“I was so upset,” Ibrahim said. But now, with their former grazing lands off limits, his father’s foresight is obvious. “If our dad hadn’t done that, where would we be now?”The piece of land he bought is a safe place for the family to retreat to, but it has nowhere near enough grazing for their herds, and so the Ibrahims are thinking of taking their father’s approach even further.“We’re thinking of sending our children to school and selling some cows to buy more land,” he said. Not everyone can afford to buy land, and not every herder is ready to give up their way of life. In the meantime, the main approach for those trying to stop the killing is rather less complex: talking.Defusing tension has always required that herders and farmers build relationships, but the mistrust that the constant attacks have engendered in the past few years has made this extremely difficult.“It’s more about managing the conflict than solving it,” said Tog Gang, of Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organisation working to create peace in central Nigeria by organising meetings like the one Dangyang was persuaded to attend, to meet the men he held responsible for trying to kill him.At their meeting place, a hotel on neutral ground in Plateau state, the men and women began to take off their dark glasses, put down their mobiles, and talk.They discussed the theft of huge herds, sometimes with the involvement of outside criminals, the slaughter of women, children and older people, the recent abundance of guns, the problems of unemployment and drug abuse among the young and the lack of intermarriage between communities.Dangyang, an influential leader in the Berom community, often used to meet and talk with the herdsmen before the attack. Now, surrounded by those he considers his enemies, he stared at the table with a pronounced frown, fiddling with a toothpick. Gidado got up to speak.“We should learn to forgive each other. We have all suffered enough and can’t move forward. We need to put an end to this,” he said in Hausa.But then he began to blame the Beroms for the whole conflict. “You can’t discipline your children,” he said.A Berom leader got up and threw the blame back. “Whenever someone steals or kills a cow, you respond by killing a person.”Dangyang rose to his feet. He told the group how it had felt to be almost burned alive, and the indignity of losing everything.Then his tone suddenly changed. He said: “I forgive the people who did this to me.”Readiness to forgive is something Saleh Momale, the development geographer who was leading the dialogue, has often seen in his peace-building work between herder and farmer communities. “This is typical Nigerians. People forgive and forget very easily,” he said. “What is difficult to resolve is political malice and mismanagement.”Nigeria’s security forces are slow to respond to calls for help, so communities arm and defend themselves. President Muhammadu Buhari’s critics say that because he is an ethnic Fulani, he turns a blind eye to his marauding kinsmen, and with Nigeria’s presidential election looming in February, tensions are even higher than usual.Mercy Corps spends time getting to know the various players intimately to ensure they are inviting the right people to their meetings. The point is not to get the participants to sign agreements they are unlikely to stick to, but to make them sit next to each other, eat together, talk honestly about the killings and the factors behind them, and, ideally, take each others’ phone numbers and plan future meetings.“Small interventions like this have done a lot of good,” said Momale. “This is the best hope – building these community institutions. I see hope in these guys. I don’t think we can count on our technocrats.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

In the east, where scores of militia commanders battle for control of mines, an outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 300. Countrywide an estimated 4.3 million people are displaced.\u0026nbspIt is still recovering from a civil war triggered by the fall of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, in which 4 million people died. Joseph Kabila has been in power as president since his father, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, the victor of that conflict, was shot dead in 2001.The country’s problems have been exacerbated by the refusal of Kabila to leave power after the end of his second mandate two years ago, which is why December’s much-delayed election was invested with so much hope and trepidation.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspChaos at polling stations on the day of the vote dampened hopes that the election would bring a measure of political stability.\u0026nbsp The announcement by the electoral commission on 10 January that Felix Tshisekedi had won confounded polling that had put another opposition figure well in front and raised fears of a backroom deal ultimately keeping Kabila in power.The church has refused to say publicly who won according to its findings, but diplomats briefed on the church data say it indicated a clear victory for Fayulu, in line with pre-election polls that had put him at least 20 points ahead of Tshisekedi.Kabila had engineered an electoral coup to deny him the presidency, Fayulu said on Thursday morning. In a statement issued later in the day, he said “unacceptable electoral fraud” had taken place that could lead to chaos across the country. “No Congolese can accept such treachery, such sham … we cannot accept at the end of this long crusade that the will of our people is not respected. … All together, let us say ‘no’ to manufacturing of results and ‘no’ to an electoral holdup. … Hand in hand may we pursue this struggle until the end,” Fayulu told his followers.The continuing tensions threatens to tip the vast central African country into a cycle of protest, violent repression and worsening insecurity – dashing hopes that the election would mark a turning point in the DRC’s troubled history.There were reports of scattered protests in some cities, with at least two reported deaths.Fayulu’s supporters had long feared Kabila would either rig the vote in favour of Shadary or do a power-sharing deal with Tshisekedi.Tshisekedi paid his respects to Kabila, whom he described as “an important partner … in democratic transition in our country”. Speaking to thousands of cheering supporters in the capital, Kinshasa, Tshisekedi said he would be the president “of all Congolese”.Following an election itself delayed by two years, the announcement of results was postponed by a week.Adeline Van Houtte, research analyst for west Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the delay had raised suspicions that the government wanted time to negotiate a backroom deal with Tshisekedi.“A Tshisekedi presidency would be the least bad alternative to a Shadary victory for the regime as it would put a veil of legitimacy on the electoral process and would be more manageable than a Fayulu presidency,” Van Houtte said.Robert Besseling, executive director of the risk consultancy EXX Africa, said Kabila had decided not to risk announcing a Shadary victory.“Instead, he chose to split the opposition by creating a power-sharing deal … Kabila will be able to influence Tshisekedi, who now owes his ascendancy to power to Kabila’s control of the electoral commission,” Besseling said.The last two elections, in 2006 and 2011, both of which were won by Kabila, were marred by bloodshed. If Tshisekedi’s victory is confirmed in the next 10 days by the constitutional court, he would be the first leader to take power via the ballot box in the DRC since Patrice Lumumba, who became prime minister shortly after the DRC won its independence from Belgium in 1960. Lumumba was toppled in a coup and killed four months later.Kabila, 47, has ruled since the 2001 assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who overthrew the long-serving dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.The DRC suffers from widespread corruption, continuing conflict, endemic disease, and some of the world’s highest levels of sexual violence and malnutrition. It is also rich in minerals, including those crucial to the world’s smartphones and electric cars.Kabila’s second electoral mandate expired in 2016 and he only reluctantly called new elections under pressure from regional powers. The constitution forbade him from standing again and critics claimed he hoped to rule through Shadary, who has no political base of his own.However, the opposition was weakened by internal arguments and the exclusion by the electoral commission of two political heavyweights: Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former warlord, and Moïse Katumbi, a popular tycoon.Tshisekedi’s father, Etienne, was a famous opposition leader under Mobutu. He died in 2017 and his son has inherited his party. Critics say Tshisekedi, 55, is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father. “His father was a man of the country. The son is very limited,” Valentin Mubake, a former secretary-general of Tshisekedi’s Union for Democracy and Social Progress told the  last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce106bac87dfccaed44ea97b71e75c61903b45f0/0_128_5444_3266/master/5444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ad9056628e714d5f40d870cdd87653","title":"four men to go on trial for giant gold coin heist from berlin museum","story":"Men accused of stealing 100kg ‘Big Maple Leaf’ in 2017 heist involving ladder, wheelbarrow and getaway carFour men accused of carrying out the spectacular heist of a giant solid gold coin worth €3.6m from a Berlin museum have gone on trial.The men stand accused of stealing the 100kg “Big Maple Leaf” from the Bode Museum after using a ladder to enter a third-floor window, smashing the bulletproof cabinet in which the coin was on display, then transporting it in a wheelbarrow to a nearby park and abseiling with it to a getaway vehicle.The theft in the early hours of 27 March 2017 stunned the German public, not least because of its audacity and old-fashioned simplicity, and the fact that no alarms were triggered in the museum.Three of the men on trial, identified according to German custom only as Wissam R, Ahmed R, and Wayci R, are members of a Berlin crime family. The fourth is a security guard identified as Denis W, who is accused of assisting the men by providing them with information about the museum which was vital to the plot. The men hid their faces behind magazines as they entered the court in Berlin and during the proceedings.The coin – 53cm in diameter and 3cm thick – was on loan to the museum from a private owner, one of only five pure gold commemorative pieces issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007 and bearing the face of Queen Elizabeth II.It is legal tender and was marketed as the world’s largest gold coin by the Canadian Royal Mint, worth 1 million dollars, but valued at €4m Euros according to the value of gold at the time of its theft. Its value at today’s gold spot price would be €3.6m.It is believed to have been broken up and melted down shortly after the theft and it is thought it will never be recovered.Detectives revealed early on in the investigation that the “R” family was part of a crime ring well known to police and whose members had carried out numerous high-profile crimes over several years, including break-ins, a bank robbery in which the bank building was blown up to hide evidence, and acts of violence in Berlin including a murder in broad daylight.Last summer Berlin investigators confiscated 77 properties valued at €9.3m which members of the R family were believed to have purchased with the proceeds from various crimes.During the investigation into the coin robbery, prosecutors said that unknown persons had tried to destroy evidence in a vehicle believed to have been the getaway car, which had been confiscated after an illegal car rally. The culprits gained access to a police compound where the car was parked and sprayed fire-extinguishing foam into its interior. But the attempts to hide evidence failed after police found gold deposits on the upholstery.The trial is expected to take about 12 days amid a huge media presence before a chamber of Berlin’s regional court reserved for youth crimes due to the ages of the three men – between 18 to 20 – when they allegedly carried out the heist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1362a73daa1cd2ebfae3032bb40b3ce20d2c0b/0_23_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14a06aaa76893672f30e0220e8c04d0","title":"what does 2019 hold for kim jong un and north korea podcast","story":"Kim Jong-un goes into 2019 with momentum to build on after last year’s historic meeting with President Donald Trump.

Photograph: TCDFor hundreds of years, Trinity College Dublin has appeared to many Dubliners as an imposing, high-walled institution they dared not enter.“I’ve spoken to people who’ve lived and worked in the capital their whole lives,” says Prof Veronica Campbell, Trinity’s bursar. “Often, their first time in Trinity may not occur until they are in their 40s or 50s.”This may be about to change. A plan to modernise Ireland’s oldest university envisages opening up the campus with a series of new pedestrian entrances and forging closer links with the city around it.There will also be a series of landmark buildings – some currently under construction – aimed at modernising ageing facilities and breathing new life into neglected streetscapes.At the same time, there is the challenge of preserving the 426-year-old university’s historic buildings, plonked right in the heart of the capital city.“For a 600-year period, Oxford and Cambridge vetoed the establishment of other universities in England. Trinity was the only other university to be established by royal charter,” says Prof Campbell.“What distinguishes Trinity further is that we have a campus with architecture of such monumental scale compared to the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge . . .“We have two million visitors a year who enjoy the campus or sit out with their sandwiches in the summer.We want our university to be a place that people walk around. It’s a balancing act we need to strike, due to security, litter and so on.”A criticism regularly levelled at the college is that it has turned its back on much of the city.The university started out as an enclosed campus and some surrounding streets have suffered as a result, such as the bleak and neglected section of Pearse Street close to the city centre.Change is coming: the new €80 million Trinity Business School is taking shape on Pearse Street, which will include a pedestrian entrance and public cafe.Further down the street, closer to the city centre, work is under way on the €62 million Printing House Square development, which will provide 250 student rooms over a health and sports centre. It will also feature a new public gateway into a new “public city square”.A new law school building – still at a concept stage – may also be housed on the street over the coming years.“Pearse Street is a challenging street with the volume of traffic, but it’s one we’ve invested in,” says Prof Campbell.“The Science Gallery has been enormously successful . . . the business school will be a great addition and the Georgian houses will have a new cafe facility that opens directly on to the street. These are tangible improvements that will really improve the retail offering.”Upgrading facilities to adapt to the changing way students learn will also feature in new developments.The days of the draughty lecture theatre are numbered, it seems. The college’s new E3 Learning Foundry – an engineering, energy and environment institute – will instead have “maker spaces” which allow students to work together on industrial techniques and processes and informal learning spaces, where students can collaborate on projects.“Empirical evidence is emerging of a positive correlation between time spent on campus and academic performance,” says Prof Campbell.“If we’re providing a good quality experience on campus, students will want to spend time here and do their informal learning, which is an important part of the modern curriculum.”The university is also planning to expand eastwards with the development of a €1 billion campus on Grand Canal Quay where it owns a 2.2 hectare (5.5 acre) site, though it is likely to take several years for these plans to be finalised.Despite the fast pace of development, it comes at a time when higher education institutions say they are facing a growing funding crisis.Yet, there are no fewer that four construction cranes on the horizon of Trinity. So, where’s all the money coming from?Prof Campbell says most new activity is funded exclusively from philanthropy, borrowing and private income generated by international students and other sources.The new E3 facility will involve €50 million in State funding, though this is the exception.“If we relied on exchequer funding we couldn’t realise our ambitions,” she says.“The other challenge is funding the refurbishment of our existing infrastructure and we haven’t had any exchequer support for that in recent years.”Trinity – like other third-level colleges – will need to expand over the coming years.Demographic trends indicate that numbers in higher education will swell by about 20 per cent over the coming decade.Trinity, which has about 18,000 students, is planning to grow by 3,500 over the next few years.“We need to have the appropriate facilities for accommodating students and staff,” says Prof Campbell.“We can’t pack them in like sardines – that’s not a quality education experience – and then we need to make sure we have sufficient staff of the appropriate calibre to train and interact with students.“There are significant resource implications in how we manage the size of the university of the future.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3752870.1547125241!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"corncrake comes back from the brink of extinction","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe corncrake, known for its rasping call, was once widespread across the countryside, but the population was decimated by mechanised farming.

Since 2012, the State has spent €2.4 million on ensuring the bird’s survival here.The 151 total for last year, however, represents a 20 per cent decline on the 1993 total when conservation measures were first introduced.In 1993 two of the strongholds were the Moy Valley and the Shannon Callows, where the bird is now extinct.On the long-term trend, the report states that this decline is “of concern and puts a question mark on the corncrake’s long-term survival in Ireland in the absence of additional measures”.Denis Strong, isional manager with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), said the great weather here last summer was a factor in the increase.The report shows too that 125 farmers shared payments of €118,447 in the Corncrake Grant Scheme last year, with an additional 10 landowners sharing €30,515 in the Farm Plan Scheme."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3753462.1547118107!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit irish government rejects stormont veto on backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is in Belfast on Thursday to meet politicians and business leaders to discuss the Brexit impasse. Photograph: Reuters The Irish Government has rejected any suggestion that a future Stormont executive could veto aspects of the Irish border backstop. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was reacting to a British government proposal that, if the Irish backstop came into operation, the devolved legislature in Belfast would have to agree to any subsequent changes to EU laws impacting on it. The backstop guarantee within the Brexit agreement seeks to avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland after the UK’s departure from the EU no matter what future trade arrangements are agreed between the EU and UK.Mr Coveney told BBC Radio Ulster on Thursday: “Let’s not forget what we are talking about here is a withdrawal agreement which is an international agreement between the UK as a whole and the EU as a whole, it isn’t a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Britain. “And so from that point of view, I don’t think a Northern Ireland executive can hold a veto over the implementation of an international treaty between the UK and the EU.”Mr Coveney is in Belfast to meet politicians and business leaders to discuss the Brexit impasse.There was confusion over whether his schedule would include a meeting with the DUP after he claimed the party had declined an offer to hold talks.However, DUP leader Arlene Foster swiftly responded, insisting she was willing to meet the Tánaiste.“The party has had useful discussions with the Irish Government in the past,” she said. “I’m happy to meet with the Tánaiste later today in Belfast.” Separately, Britain’s business secretary Greg Clark this morning called on MPs to come together to prevent a no-deal Brexit. After the Government suffered two Commons defeats in the space of 24 hours, Mr Clark said it was clear there was no majority for Britain leaving the EU without a deal. “It is my strong view that we need to come together. We need to act to avoid a no deal because I don’t think there is anything remotely like a majority in Parliament that will tolerate this,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “The default is in law that unless we have a deal then we will fall into no deal. Now, I think, is the time for Parliament to recognise this. We need to come together, we need to do a deal.” “We need to reflect on the points that are going to be made in the debates, but really give expression to that determination across Parliament and conduct ourselves in the way that our reputation internationally has always been - to be pragmatic and dependable - and that means doing a deal.”- PA Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: ESAHubbleNasaM KornmesserPA WireThe Hubble telescope has discovered the brightest quasar ever seen in the early universe. The quasar has the brightness of about 600 trillion suns.Astronomers used data from the NasaEuropean Space Agency Hubble Space Telescope to find the ancient quasar, which they believe can provide an insight into the birth of galaxies when the universe was about one billion years old.Astronomers said the discovery is by far the brightest quasar yet found in the early universe.A quasar is the extremely bright nucleus of an active galaxy and its powerful glow is created by the incredible amounts of energy released by gas falling towards the supermassive black hole at its centre.The newly discovered ancient quasar, catalogued as J043947.08+163415.7, is so old that the light being received from it started its journey when the universe was only about one billion years old.Nasa’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe in 2012 estimated that the universe is more than 13 billion years old.Astronomers said the quasar has a brightness equivalent to about 600 trillion suns and the supermassive black hole powering it is several hundred million times as massive as our sun.The data shows not only that the supermassive black hole is accreting matter to itself at an extremely high rate, but also that the quasar may be producing up to 10,000 stars per year, scientists said.This compares with the Milky Way, which produces about one new star every year.The lead author of a study on the quasar, Xiaohui Fan, of the University of Arizona, said he did not expect to find many quasars brighter than this one in the whole universe.“We don’t expect to find many quasars brighter than that in the whole observable universe.”Co-author Fabian Walter, of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, said the quasar was a prime candidate for further investigation.He added: “Its properties and its distance make it a prime candidate to investigate the evolution of distant quasars and the role supermassive black holes in their centres had on star formation.”Despite the quasar’s brightness, Hubble was only able to spot it with the help of strong gravitational lensing caused by a dim galaxy between the quasar and Earth.The galaxy bent the light from the quasar, making it appear three times as large and 50 times as bright as it would have been without the effect of this gravitational lensing, astronomers said.The team hope to use the Atacama Large Millimetresubmillimetre Array and the James Webb Space Telescope, due to be launched in 2021, to look at the supermassive black hole and directly measure the influence of its gravity on the surrounding gas and star formation. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3752920.1547117386!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sounds heard from deep space could be evidence of advanced alien technology","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupernova remnants, one of the suggested sources for 13 FRBs discovered by a Canadian-led team. File photograph: Nasa via The New York TimesMysterious repeating energy bursts from deep space that some experts have suggested could be evidence of advanced aliens have been detected for the second time. The repeating bursts are an example of what are known as fast radio bursts (FRBs), millisecond-long flashes of radio waves whose origin is unknown.Most scientists believe they are generated by powerful astrophysical phenomena such as black holes or super-dense neutron stars. But a few scientists have suggested more outlandish theories.Prof Avid Loeb, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in the US, argues that they could be evidence of incredibly advanced alien technology.FRBs were first detected accidentally in 2007, when a burst signal was spotted in radio astronomy data collected in 2001.The new discovery, reported in the journal Nature, was made by a Canadian-led team of astronomers on the hunt for FRBs.Over a period of three weeks last summer, the team detected 13 FRBs using a new type of radio telescope, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (Chime).One of the FRBs was repeating. Of the more than 60 FRBs detected to date, such repeating bursts have only been picked up once before, by the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in 2015.Where the FRBs come from is not known, although they are thought to emanate from sources billions of light years away outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.Chime astrophysicist Dr Ingrid Stairs, from the University of British Columbia, Canada, said: “Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB.“Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles – where they’re from and what causes them.”Most of the 13 FRBs showed signs of “scattering”, suggesting their sources could be powerful astrophysical objects in locations with special characteristics, the scientists said.Team member Dr Cherry Ng, from the University of Toronto, Canada, said: “That could mean in some sort of dense clump like a supernova remnant. Or near the central black hole in a galaxy. But it has to be in some special place to give us all the scattering that we see.”In 2017 Prof Loeb and Harvard colleague Manasvi Lingham proposed that FRBs could be leakage from planet-sized alien transmitters.Rather than being designed for communication, they would more likely be used to propel giant spaceships powered by light sails.Prof Loeb, who discusses the idea in a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said: “An artificial origin is worth contemplating and checking.” – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3753353.1547109027!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"drc election main opposition leader secures surprise victory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople gather at dawn in Goma, northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, to celebrate Felix Tshisekedi’s victory. Photograph: ALEXIS HUGUETAFPGetty ImagesThe leader of the main opposition party in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been declared the surprise winner of the country’s December 30th presidential election.The result giving victory to Felix Tshisekedi, announced early on Thursday, means the first electoral transfer of power in 59 years of independence in the DRC.It will come as a shock to many observers who believed authorities would ensure the government candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, would be the winner in the polls, the third since the end of a bloody civil war in 2002.On Thursday, Mr Tshisekedi paid his respects to outgoing president Joseph Kabila, whom he described as “an important partner” in democratic transition in our country”.Speaking to thousands of cheering supporters in the capital Kinshasa, Mr Tshisekedi said he would be the president “of all Congolese”.His victory is deeply controversial as pre-election polls had given outspoken opposition frontrunner Martin Fayulu, a respected former business executive, a healthy lead. Polls had put Mr Fayulu on 47 per cent, at least 20 points ahead of Mr Tshisekedi. Vote tallies compiled by the DRC’s Catholic church found Mr Fayulu clearly won the election, two diplomats told Reuters, raising the spectre of protests that many fear could lead to violence.Mr Fayulu’s supporters feared Mr Kabila would rig the vote in favour of his hand-picked candidate, or do a power-sharing deal with Mr Tshisekedi, head of the DRC’s main opposition party.Mr Tshisekedi’s father, Etienne, was a famous opposition leader who died last year, and his son has inherited his party. Critics say Mr Tshisekedi (55) is unproven, inexperienced and lacks the charisma of his father.Already delayed by two years, the announcement of results was postponed by a further week to allow more time to overcome logistical challenges in a country of 80 million inhabitants spread over an area the size of western Europe with almost no paved roads.Riot police were deployed outside the offices of the DRC’s election commission and elsewhere in the capital, Kinshasa.Mr Kabila’s second electoral mandate expired in 2016 and he only reluctantly called new elections under pressure from regional powers. The constitution forbade him from standing again, and critics claimed he hoped to rule through Mr Shadary, who has no political base of his own.Mr Kabila (47) has ruled since the 2001 assassination of his father, Laurent Kabila, who overthrew long-serving dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.Mr Tshisekedi is the first leader to takes power via the ballot box in the DRC since prime minister Patrice Lumumba shortly after the DRC won its independence from Belgium in 1960. Mr Lumumba was toppled in a coup and killed four months later.The DRC suffers from widespread corruption, continuing conflict, endemic disease, and some of the world’s highest levels of sexual violence and malnutrition. It is also rich in minerals, including those crucial to the world’s smartphones and electric cars. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3752798.1547063128!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit house of commons divided in vote over plan b timeline","story":"UK Prime Minister Theresa May got in a fiery exchange with the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, when confronted on the lack of change on her Brexit deal.

Photograph: UK ParliamentMark DuffyPA Wire Dramatic scenes in the Commons on Wednesday saw MPs challenge the Speaker in angry points of order for more than an hour, and the House ide into almost equal factions.For John Bercow’s critics on the government benches, he had undermined the authority of his office and established a dangerous precedent by allowing MPs to amend a motion hitherto regarded as unamendable. To his admirers, who included Conservatives as well as opposition MPs, he was a fearless champion of the right of parliament to assert itself against the executive.Leaving the argument over procedure aside, however, the House’s approval of Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the motion on Theresa May’s Brexit deal could prove to be a hinge moment in the story of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. It represents parliament’s long-anticipated move to take control of a process that the minority Conservative government has shown itself incapable of managing successfully.If the prime minister’s deal is rejected, as expected, next Tuesday, she will have just three sitting days to come back to parliament with a motion outlining what she proposes to do next.That motion will be amendable, allowing MPs to test support for alternatives, including a Norway-plus model that would see Britain remaining in the single market and the customs union, and a second referendum that could stop Brexit.MPs demonstrated in a vote on Tuesday night that a majority opposes leaving the EU without a deal. But if the prime minister is unable to pass her deal, what chance do the alternatives have of winning a majority?Before the Christmas recess, support for Norway-plus appeared to be seeping away as Remainers, particularly on the Labour benches, started to believe that a second referendum was achievable. Labour seemed poised to take the steps agreed at its party conference last year that would lead it to support a second referendum, favoured by most of its members.Since parliament returned this week, however, the Labour leadership’s lack of enthusiasm for a second vote has remained undiminished and some wavering MPs have become anxious about the potential toxicity of another referendum. In the chamber yesterday, Conservatives Oliver Letwin and Ken Clarke were negotiating in public with shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, about the kind of compromise Labour could accept.A cross-party majority has revealed itself at Westminster this week to oppose a no-deal Brexit and assert parliamentary control over the withdrawal process. But it has yet to marshal itself behind a single plan for Brexit, without which Britain will crash out of the EU on March 29th.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Jeremy Corbyn says extending Article 50 a \u0026#39possibility\u0026#39 as he backs down on confidence voteThe Dominic Grieve amendment explained: Could it prevent a no deal Brexit? When is the Brexit \u0026#39meaningful vote\u0026#39 in Parliament, and what will happen if Theresa May\u0026#39s deal is rejected?What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?Ashley Judd harassment case against Weinstein thrown out by judge on technicalityCrown Prosecution Service to review  rules on protests after \u0026#39Nazi\u0026#39 chants at MP outside ParliamentMarried music teacher had sex with choir boys as school faces questions over why she wasn\u0026#39t struck off soonerDig for Victory campaign is in danger of being forgotten, RHS warns as it launches campaign to discover pictures of WW2 plots before we \u0026#39run out of time\u0026#39 Woman and her two children die in outlawed Nepal \u0026#39menstrual hut\u0026#39Theresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullMarines set up specialist Novichok unit in response to Salisbury attackWill Theresa May resign if she loses the Brexit vote?

The implications, not only for domestic food supply but for the careful management of our cherished countryside, would represent an historic political failure.“Our organisations remain committed to playing their part in managing Brexit in the best interests of farmers and the UK public in the years ahead, but we believe that leaving without a deal on March 29 will lead, very quickly, to the opposite outcome.“We urge MPs, in light of the central role Parliament will play in the coming days in resolving this impasse, to recognise the severe impact No Deal will have and to take all steps necessary to avoid such a departure coming to pass.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What assumptions are they based on? And what\u0026nbspreal significance does any of it have? asks Ben ChuClick to followThe IndependentThe US will be a distant third and the UK will not even be in the top ten according to Standard Chartered projectionsChina and India will be the two biggest economies in the world by 2030, according to a report by analysts at Standard Chartered bank.The US will be a distant third and the UK will not even be in the top ten.Countries such as Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt and Brazil will all be higher than us on the list.But how plausible are these predictions? What assumptions are they based on? And what\u0026nbspreal significance does any of it have?The answer is GDP and the exchange rate used is something called “Purchasing Power Parity” (PPP).Standard Chartered’s projections suggest the size of the Chinese economy in 2030 on this measure will be $64.2 trillion, India’s will be $46.3 and the United States’ will be just $31 trillion.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialA US dollar generally goes much further in poorer countries than in richer ones – something anyone who has, for instance, eaten out in Thailand or bought something from a market stall while on holiday in Morocco will know.When one makes a statistical adjustment for this fact of erging purchasing power, the measured size of a less developed economy rises. This is GDP at PPP.Using the measure, China is already larger than the US, having surpassed America in 2015.And Indian output actually surpassed that of the UK way back in 1995.Is there another way of measuring the size of an economy then?Yes. One could use simple market exchange rates.By this measure the US is still today the world’s biggest economy, with a $7 trillion lead over China.Using market exchange rates rather than PPP would also most likely change the 2030 picture.The International Monetary Funds does not forecast beyond 2023, but at this date the Fund thinks the US will still be the world’s largest economy at market exchange rates and that the UK will still have a comfortable lead over the likes of Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and the rest with little evidence of catch-up.India, however, will surpass the UK even at market exchange rates in the coming years.Which is the better measure?Views are ided. Some economists argue market exchange rates give a better indication\u0026nbspof the relative importance of national economies in the global trade system, a country’s demand for imports and investment and so on.This is certainly the measure that financial traders mostly use.The PPP adjustment is also based on global surveys to measure relative purchasing power which are taken only every three years and which are inevitably\u0026nbspsketchy.But other economists\u0026nbspargue that PPP gives a better indication of shifts in a developing country’s domestic consumer demand.“PPP is generally regarded as a better measure of overall well-being,” says the IMF.Yet, leaving aside this debate, the important thing to recognise is that neither measure gives an indication of average living standards in each country, of a country’s general level of prosperity.The reason why China is larger than the US at PPP exchange rates is because it has a population four times larger.If one measures GDP at PPP per person a very different picture emerges, with China on $18,000 and the US on $63,000.And the UK is doing far better than India with a GDP at PPP per capita of $46,000 versus just $7,800.Moreover, on the IMF’s projections over the next five years there is little sign of catch-up on this metric between the US and the UK and those developing world countries. Not even China gets close.We can pretty safely predict that people in the developed world will, on average, still be much better off than those in developing countries in 2030.How plausible are these projections?Standard Chartered says its forecasts are “underpinned by one key principle: countries’ share of world GDP should eventually converge with their share of the world’s population, driven by the convergence of per-capita GDP between advanced and emerging economies”.This isn’t unreasonable. As developing countries deploy the productivity-boosting technologies of the rich world they should, in theory, become more productive and their growth rates should be more rapid.This is why China has had a double digit GDP annual growth rate for the past twenty years but growth rates in Europe and the US have been below 3 per cent.And ultimately countries with bigger populations should have bigger national economies, whether measured by market exchange rates or PPP.Yet assuming an uninterrupted catch-up path for poorer countries is questionable.Crises are inevitable. A few years ago many economists were projecting rapid growth in Brazil, but instead the country fell into a savage recession. One cannot rule out such a temporary reversal for China or India.There has also been a clear tendency for developing countries to get stuck in a “middle income\u0026nbsptrap”, where, after rapid growth up to a certain level, developing countries seem unable to make the leap to developed world per capita incomes.Indeed, avoiding this trap has become an obsession for Chinese policymakers in recent years. They are not assuming a straight line to prosperity, even if some Western bank analysts are.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A horrible recession followed hot on its heels. So if\u0026nbspyou\u0027re inclined to run and hide under the covers no one would blame you.But there were some bright spots. The BRC figures showed sales of food, toys and computers were up, which helps to explain, the decent overall performance put in by the supermarkets. Among them,\u0026nbspAldi did great, Morrisons was ok, Sainsbury’s no worse than feared. Tesco, the latest\u0026nbspto go, confirmed the trend. It reported core UK sales up 2.2 per cent over Christmas.\u0026nbspThe beast is well and truly back.\u0026nbspThe consumer seems to have decided to spend on food and gifts for the kids, while reigning in on everyone and everything else.\u0026nbspSuch belt tightening, coming after years of negative inflation adjusted wage growth, is no bad thing. Borrowing or dipping into the savings, which is what people have been doing over the past few years, is unsustainable long term. The decision by many Britons to conserve resources is particularly wise at a time when the Conservative Government of Theresa May seems hell bent on kicking the country in the teeth.\u0026nbspBut you have to pity the people on the sharp end. Debs is in the worst state. There is a big question mark over the long term future of the department store as a concept, but the rapidity of the decline at this one tells you it’s got it badly wrong.Sales fell by 5.7 per cent over the 18 weeks to January 5. Chief executive Sergio Bucher somehow managed to confirm his profit guidance, but the ongoing conversations about refinancing he’s having to hold with lenders can’t be easy. Would you be keen to lend to this business?The decline in sales at M\u0026ampS - 2.2 per cent - was par for the course for this one time high street bellwether that has been scratching its corporate head about how to get things moving for years now.\u0026nbspCompared to those two the John Lewis Partnership is basking in the sunlit uplands. Even with distressed rivals throwing cheap stock out of their doors before closing them, it managed to report a 1 per cent rise in sales at stores open at least year.\u0026nbspThat might not look like anything to write home about, but there are plenty of retail bosses that would e into a pool full of hungry crocodiles if it meant they\u0026nbspcould get even close to that.\u0026nbspProfits will be down this year, but they\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspstill be decent enough.

The implications, not only for domestic food supply but for the careful management of our cherished countryside, would represent an historic political failure.“Our organisations remain committed to playing their part in managing Brexit in the best interests of farmers and the UK public in the years ahead, but we believe that leaving without a deal on March 29 will lead, very quickly, to the opposite outcome.“We urge MPs, in light of the central role Parliament will play in the coming days in resolving this impasse, to recognise the severe impact No Deal will have and to take all steps necessary to avoid such a departure coming to pass.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s government policy that\u0027s driving this and therefore government policy that is driving the increase in bills for consumers.”Daron Walker, senior reporting officer for smart metering at BEIS, said: “We are definitely not complacent. We fundamentally scrutinise and care about the cost of this programme as much as consumers do.”Ms Flint replied: “They are escalating. They are going up and there is no sign that they are going to go down.”Government will miss its own smart meter deadline, watchdog warns Smart meters to cut energy bills by just £11 a year, MPs saySimon Read: \u0027Smart meters will stop energy firms owing us cash\u0027Smart meters set to cost households £215 in return for minor savingsJames Ashton: Smart-meter plans aren\u0027t looking so brightUp to 53 million smart meters, which will replace traditional electricity and gas meters in homes and businesses, were due to be installed across Britain by the end of 2020 to meet the Government\u0027s target, saving households an average of £18 a year between 2013 and 2030 after they have met the costs of the programme.However, the rollout has struck a number of issues, with the NAO finding that about 70 per cent of first generation SMETS1 meters “go dumb” when people switch to a new supplier.The NAO said suppliers installed seven million more SMETS1 meters than planned after BEIS under-estimated how long it would take to implement the infrastructure and technical standards for their second-generation successors, with the mass rollout adding to the complexity and cost of the programme.BEIS planned to resolve the problem by connecting SMETS1 meters to updated infrastructure, but this project had been delayed by six months to May 2019 and the NAO said it was not certain if it would work as intended.The NAO said the significant delay to the start of the second-generation rollout was increasing the risk of escalating costs and technology being rolled out before defects had been addressed, also warning that it could take years before it was known if it entirely worked.However, the NAO concluded: “The facts summarised above, and many more, are not fatal to the viability and value for money of the programme.“However, there are serious issues that need to be addressed if smart meters is to progress successfully and deliver value for money.”gas and electricityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The ASA, which is funded by advertisers, does not have the power to fine companies.Last year, Provident was ordered to pay a £2m fine and £169m to 1.2 million Vanquis customers for selling an add-on product called a Repayment Option Plan (ROP) which was not fully explained.Hammond launches Budget assault on loan sharks and payday lendersWonga goes into administrationWe need to educate kids about money and the perils of payday lendersThe FCA has attempted to rein in providers of high-cost credit with rules capping\u0026nbsppayday loan interest rates charges in 2015. Last month, the regulator said providers must compensate consumers who had been missold\u0026nbsppayday loans, even in instances where\u0026nbspno complaint has been made.But concerns remain that cash-strapped borrowers are turning to payday loans and other expensive forms of credit in order to make ends meet.Last week, Bank of England data showed that credit card debt had risen 7.1 per cent in the year to November and now stands at £72.5bn.A representative from Provident said: “The ASA informed us of a complaint made about the advertisement and we subsequently removed it from circulation, prior to the ASA\u0027s final ruling.“Provident also provided assurances to the ASA that such content will not be used in any further marketing materials.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

App developers share data with Facebook through the Facebook Software Developer Kit (SDK), a set of software development tools that help developers build apps for a specific operating system.Apps found to be sharing data with Facebook included language-learning tool Duolingo, job database Indeed and flight search engine Skyscanner. A spokesperson for Skyscanner\u0026nbspsaid it had updated its data-collecting practices in the wake of the report.Facebook said that sharing data is common practice for many companies and that it did so in a transparent manner.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s government policy that\u0027s driving this and therefore government policy that is driving the increase in bills for consumers.”Daron Walker, senior reporting officer for smart metering at BEIS, said: “We are definitely not complacent. We fundamentally scrutinise and care about the cost of this programme as much as consumers do.”Ms Flint replied: “They are escalating. They are going up and there is no sign that they are going to go down.”Government will miss its own smart meter deadline, watchdog warns Smart meters to cut energy bills by just £11 a year, MPs saySimon Read: \u0027Smart meters will stop energy firms owing us cash\u0027Smart meters set to cost households £215 in return for minor savingsJames Ashton: Smart-meter plans aren\u0027t looking so brightUp to 53 million smart meters, which will replace traditional electricity and gas meters in homes and businesses, were due to be installed across Britain by the end of 2020 to meet the Government\u0027s target, saving households an average of £18 a year between 2013 and 2030 after they have met the costs of the programme.However, the rollout has struck a number of issues, with the NAO finding that about 70 per cent of first generation SMETS1 meters “go dumb” when people switch to a new supplier.The NAO said suppliers installed seven million more SMETS1 meters than planned after BEIS under-estimated how long it would take to implement the infrastructure and technical standards for their second-generation successors, with the mass rollout adding to the complexity and cost of the programme.BEIS planned to resolve the problem by connecting SMETS1 meters to updated infrastructure, but this project had been delayed by six months to May 2019 and the NAO said it was not certain if it would work as intended.The NAO said the significant delay to the start of the second-generation rollout was increasing the risk of escalating costs and technology being rolled out before defects had been addressed, also warning that it could take years before it was known if it entirely worked.However, the NAO concluded: “The facts summarised above, and many more, are not fatal to the viability and value for money of the programme.“However, there are serious issues that need to be addressed if smart meters is to progress successfully and deliver value for money.”gas and electricityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The British empire was seen by others around the globe as the cornerstone of its stability (imperial injustices aside). This view arose from the former British colonies’ familiarity with British troops, British industry and trade, as well as British soft power (the royal family and BBC) and what it used to mean for them, for their past and future.However, the increasing dominance of the US moonlight’s beam in the 20th century meant, naturally, the sunset of the British hegemony. Since the Americans grabbed the world’s remote control, there has been a reset – with the world order drastically changed in the American direction. And the world has received the new American cultural reality with few apparent\u0026nbspconflictions, except one, the British legacy. British officials, institutions and soldiers may have left their ex-colonies, but their imprint has remained.Due to its intertwining impact on the future and welfare of people in the UK, Brexit has tended to be seen, from abroad, as a local mess with no immediate implication anywhere else. Is it true though? Are citizens in other parts of the world immune to the effects of Brexit’s shrapnel? In any event, do people elsewhere care about us? Certainly it might be reasonable to think that it’s important to know what they make of us and of our country.350m a week for the NHS became a defining symbol of the Brexit referendum campaign (Getty)Many people in Britain see their country in mayhem, but they don’t necessarily know what to do to get themselves out of Brexit\u0027s snare (not even the government appears to have an answer, nor most of those who voted for EU withdrawal). The confusion over the outcome of the referendum in 2016 – which is psychological at its core – has been so powerful that it has split society in two. Some are doomed to see Brexit as a Noah’s Ark others are ready to put a big hole in it below the water line.But if you think we in the UK are confused, it should be said that people around the world follow events without having any clue about what on earth is happening here. Wherever you go now, the question on everyone’s lips is along the lines of: why are the British muddling themselves into this most abhorrent and unjustified self-harm?Brexit casts a dark cloud over our experts’ predictions for 2019Do not get me wrong, people from all over the globe watch the BBC too. Many are still able to form some sort of opinion on the subject. Indeed, given the complexities involved, this has created a paradoxical reality where someone in Nicaragua can be as educated on Brexit as a Brexiteer from the midlands of England. It’s not the information that people lack, it’s their ability to absorb (and perhaps contextualise) it.For many beyond our shores, the right acronym for this dogged quandary which the UK has been juggling with for two and a half years is political “civil war”. This might be a bit over-amplified, but it is, indeed, some kind of a war waging, but in a civil manner.Yet the outcome of the British conflict over Brexit still might, as the UK did in the past, play a role in forming the world’s reality. Exiting the EU has set a different course for the post-Second World War\u0026nbsporder a course which could end up setting Europe ablaze.People on the other side of the English Channel have certainly grown very sceptical about British integrity when it comes to doing business of any kind. There is no point signing a deal with a nation that appears unable or unwilling to honour its word on previous European deals it has been part of. This is what Britain’s image abroad has become in some quarters.Take the Norwegians as another example. Once a “Norway-style” option became a possible alternative to Ms May’s Brexit agreement, Norwegian politicians panicked mainly because, after turning our back on the EU, they duly thought that Britain could get Norway’s ship scuttled too. Many in Europe just don’t trust Britain anymore. They increasingly think that the British gamble over leaving the EU could wreak havoc on their own present and future.But Europeans are not alone. Americans watch Brexit with horror too. Well, not all Americans, but especially those who did not vote for Donald Trump. Trump supporters see Brexit as a victory on the same historical scale as their waggish president’s inauguration. But on the other side of the US political scene, life is gloomier.In fact, Brexit didn’t promote ision and fear only in Britain it also helped to create two Americas. One understands that Britain had no need whatsoever to depart the EU in order to deepen its ties with the US, as those disingenuous leavers are still trying to argue. This America represents the liberal institutions, most branches of officialdom and those who see the benefits of globalisation.Nevertheless, Trump is still pushing Britain to crash out with no deal, claiming that an endorsement of Ms May’s Brexit deal would mean the UK losing out on a favourable bilateral trade agreement with the US. This is not an off-the-cuff claim: it is a real bid from the most powerful man on the planet to sabotage the UK’s “special” relationship with America by feeding his own nationalist agenda.An opinion poll by Emerson College, published at the end of last year, showed that 91 per cent\u0026nbspof Americans support the “special relationship”.However, it seems that Americans have lost their faith in Britain as a trade partner. While\u0026nbspa majority still support a bilateral free trade agreement with the UK after Brexit, the poll showed that many in the US don’t think that Britain is a trustworthy partner to do business with. Of the respondents, 48 per cent\u0026nbsprated China as the most important trading partner for the US (76 per cent\u0026nbsphad China in their top two), and 20 per cent\u0026nbspwent for Canada first. Only 6 per cent of respondents saw Britain as the top trade partner (behind Israel and Australia too).Does the relationship, under Trump, still sound “special”?The other America – Donald Trump’s America – does not spare any thought to what’s happening abroad: it simply wants to take back control, supports building a wall on its border to stop immigration, chants “America first”\u0026nbspand wants to ditch multilateral institutions, such as Nato and the EU. It rings a bell, right?However, the association of Brexit’s bad boys with Trump’s presidential campaign was not the ultimate eye-catcher in terms of foreign involvement in the UK’s decision to split from the EU. What was most notable was capturing Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, and other leavers, in the same bed with Russia.Indeed, the alleged efforts of Banks and Farage to foster contact with both Russian officials and Trump’s campaign have raised concerns among investigators in the UK and the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit has so far proved to be a zero-sum game, and the only nation still in love with zero-sum games is Russia. There should be no doubt by now that Brexit will only play into Russia’s hands. The very notion of “apocalyptic Europe”\u0026nbsphas informed the national belief system of the poker-faced Russian president Vladimir Putin for years. Stumbling out of a humiliating defeat at the end of the Cold War, the ex-KGB officer always saw a united Europe as another Soviet Union, but on the other side of the game.Ostensibly, it looks like this assumption has a Russian government monopoly, but, as time passes, skies are becoming cloudier. Putin managed to manipulate the Russian people into his antagonised theory through fuelling acrimony towards the west. This has been always a key tactic, which has proved efficient in turning ordinary citizens – more or less compelled as they are to consume constant, malicious propaganda – to believe that Brexit can turn the wheel in Russia’s favour. It’s so obvious from every angle in the globe – except where Brexiteers sit, of course – that Russia can’t wait but to see us out (for its own ends).No wonder Moscow has been meddling in Brexit from day one. The US Senate published a report in January last year noting that UK campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of political donations if they are from “the beneficial owners of non-British companies that are incorporated in the EU and carry out business in the UK”. This opacity, the report suggested, “may have enabled Russian-related money to be directed with insufficient scrutiny to various UK political actors”.This came as experts from the University of California at Berkeley and Swansea University identified 150,000 Twitter accounts with Russian ties that had been spreading messages on Brexit, which is not even to mention the Russian-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik’s extensive and “systematically one-sided coverage” of the Brexit debate, as the Senate report put it.Russian fake news teams targeted Mueller to discredit Trump probeBut Russians don’t really like these “accusations”, and robustly defend their government’s theory no matter what (and its denial of involvement). “We all agree that the Russian government has nothing to do with Brexit, and didn’t intervene one bit. We are stunned by these accusations,”\u0026nbspElena Sobonina, a Moscow-based expert on Russia’s foreign policy, told me.“We are Europe’s closest neighbours, therefore stability of the continent is crucial for us. We can’t afford playing this game, but if you want to know who is really working on weakening the EU and Nato you have to look west, to the US”, she said. “Everyone in Russia believes so.”Russians can point to Trump as Europe’s biggest rival, they can also claim that they are the champions of the EU’s stability but in Putin’s eyes, Britain will always be a special enemy. \u0026nbspThe poisoning of the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in March last year in Salisbury helped Putin’s close circle to make the case to ordinary Russians. While wacky politicians, like Boris Johnson, were turning the show into an outcry for their own self-indulgent political tactics, Putin was mobilising Russia’s citizens – through their natural sense of grievance since the collapse of the Soviet Union – against Britain and what it represents.Britain’s hard stance on Russia – that it was to blame for the attempted assassination and ought to be punished – sent a message to Balkan and former Soviet nations that they would not be on their own, that Britain would not abdicate its responsibilities towards this part of the world, where people still perceive Russia as a threat. A young Lithuanian told me: “Old people, who lived under the Soviet occupation, do not invest in a home or\u0026nbspland because they still think the Russians will, eventually, come over and take everything away.”However, the way in which Britain’s position was perceived in ex-Soviet spheres of influence also uncovered a huge sympathy towards Russia and Putin’s cause in countries seen as crucial for Britain after Brexit, like China.British politicians have rarely been able to understand China due to a major misconception about its intentions. Ironically, Britain – the liberal empire which used to dominate the world – is plagued by isolationism and xenophobia, while the ex-communist acropolis, China, is becoming ever more free market orientated, undertaking a systematic process to liberalise trade.What I learned about Brexit inside the school for the French eliteDuring his visit to Beijing last summer, the\u0026nbspchancellor Philip Hammond seemed to be presenting Britain’s letter of credence to the Chinese, as they become the champion of free trade. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd sure enough, despite seeing Brexit as an imminent threat to the world’s economic stability, Chinese leaders still see it as a potentially big opportunity. Chinese businessmen, especially, believe it is a good idea to take advantage of the British “national desperation” to sign free trade deals. This promise, which has always been at the core of Brexiteer’s arguments for leaving the EU campaign, created Britain’s vulnerability in the eyes of pushy China. Chinese president Xi Jinping will trade with Britain, but this time on his own terms.In truth though, while China and the US are locked in a trade war, Britain’s dreams in the east seem diminished for now. Post-Brexit Britain will increasingly become dependent on the US (probably on Trump’s terms), and as long as Trump is in the Oval Office, the likelihood of any trade deal with China is minimal.As for ordinary Chinese craftsmen and small business owners, who look to foreign markets to sell their goods, many wonder why their British equivalents would countenance running away from the EU, the biggest market in the world. Asked about Brexit and how people back home see it, a Chinese restaurateur in London’s Chinatown told me: “People don’t get it! They just sit there mocking the British and having a laugh at them.”The real laugh is that Brexiteers are trying to sell a globalised “new” Britain, while leaving the very European organisation that still holds the global liberal system together and that is at the heart of global trade.According to the same diplomat, “Arab leaders want Britain to stay in the EU because they know that Brexit will hit its role on the international stage really hard, and subsequently we, in the Arab world, would have a lot at stake”.For Gulf countries particularly, trade with Britain is indisputably important. But in a region where stability (such as it is) still relies heavily on the US and the UK, any radical change in these two countries’ roles on the global stage would reflect heavily on the area. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“In the GCC, those who are traditionally bigger proponents of regional organisations see Brexit as a threat to regionalism tout-court, and see … the potential weakening of the EU as mirroring or anticipating the weakening of the GCC,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspCinzia Bianco, a researcher on Gulf-European relations at the University of Exeter.“This is especially because the GCC, for a period during the early 2000s, looked at the EU as a potential model in certain aspects,”\u0026nbspshe adds.Those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the Mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideasMany in the Gulf believe the UK was never meant to be part of the EU, and saw the UK as something different. According to Ms Bianco: “This is mostly due to the historical background of the UK being a semi-colonial power in the Gulf: GCC countries, therefore, have traditionally dealt with London on a bilateral level, with strong defence, political and economic relations, and very rarely through the EU.”This might explain why the Arab media is pretty much obsessed with Brexit. All the big ones – Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia, Al Ghad – and even local news channels now follow Brexit more than Syria or Libya’s bloody civil wars.But when you participate in a Brexit debate on one of these channels, the pressing question they all ask is: “Do you think another referendum will take place?” It sounds like Arabs, for some reason, want Britain to stay in the EU more than British people themselves. This interest is reflected in the number of Independent readers from the Middle East who are keen to read about the subject. Brexit is our best-read topic in Egypt.Why might this be? Maybe it is a subconscious sympathy hammered out of an historical feeling of association (for good or ill) with Britain’s affairs. Maybe it is a genuine fear that if Great Britain exits the EU, it will not be great again and its role in the Middle East will be diminished.An Arab diplomat reflected ironically on the question when I put it to him: “Maybe our people are afraid of European immigration if Brexit would, at some point in the future, result in the collapse of the EU.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Most seem to be aware, despite the extensive coverage, of nothing more than the bare fact that Brexit means Britain would be walking away from the EU. But their favourite question remains: “But, why?” And that is a good question indeed.“The reason why Brexit hasn’t been on the ordinary Arabs’ top of the agenda is that it happened in conjunction with what is called ‘the Arab Spring’, including the Syrian, Yemeni, and Libyan civil conflicts,”\u0026nbspsays Mohamed Kawas, a prominent French-Lebanese journalist.“On governments’ level, those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In fact, in their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideas”, he adds.It should be clear by now that Brexit is not just a local British dilemma. It will not only change people’s lives here, but in some other parts of the world too – directly or indirectly. This is due to its strategic and economic impact on Europe’s stability, Britain’s position on the world’s stage, and how Brexit will help Russia to rise again as a superpower in a new bipolar order.It is notable too that whereas the English language has always been a big help in making local issues, especially in the UK and the US, explicable internationally, the complexities of Brexit (and its inane explanations) did the opposite. For many outsiders, debate about Brexit remains something their eyes can see but their minds can’t process.Still, it has been the UK’s global standing as a nation of good repute that has been hit most. Those who always looked up to this country and its democratic and liberal values are united with those who loathe its imperial history and disastrous foreign policy decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq. Both sides – allies and foes – are now sceptical about Britain’s integrity and honesty, and doubtful about the extent to which other nations can any longer follow Britain’s leadership.\u0026nbspOf course, the British people themselves still have to get their heads around Brexit before anyone else. But whatever the outcome, it will not change the new reality:\u0026nbspthe damage is done, and Britain is not great anymore.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The ASA, which is funded by advertisers, does not have the power to fine companies.Last year, Provident was ordered to pay a £2m fine and £169m to 1.2 million Vanquis customers for selling an add-on product called a Repayment Option Plan (ROP) which was not fully explained.Hammond launches Budget assault on loan sharks and payday lendersWonga goes into administrationWe need to educate kids about money and the perils of payday lendersThe FCA has attempted to rein in providers of high-cost credit with rules capping\u0026nbsppayday loan interest rates charges in 2015. Last month, the regulator said providers must compensate consumers who had been missold\u0026nbsppayday loans, even in instances where\u0026nbspno complaint has been made.But concerns remain that cash-strapped borrowers are turning to payday loans and other expensive forms of credit in order to make ends meet.Last week, Bank of England data showed that credit card debt had risen 7.1 per cent in the year to November and now stands at £72.5bn.A representative from Provident said: “The ASA informed us of a complaint made about the advertisement and we subsequently removed it from circulation, prior to the ASA\u0027s final ruling.“Provident also provided assurances to the ASA that such content will not be used in any further marketing materials.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It both deepens the mystery and offers a potential opportunity to finally understand what might be throwing out the burst from a galaxy billions of light years away.Fast radio bursts have been speculated to be the result of everything from exploding stars to transmissions from aliens. But they have remained entirely mysterious, with little evidence at all of where they might be coming from.The flashes only last for a milisecond but they are flung out with the same amount of energy the sun takes 12 months to produce.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialProbably most exciting of the new bursts is one that scientists saw repeat six times, apparently from the same location. Of the more than 60 fast radio bursts detected so far, only one of them has ever repeated.\u0026nbsp“Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB. Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles—where they’re from and what causes them,” said Ingrid Stairs, a member of the CHIME team and an astrophysicist at UBC.Seeing two repeating signals probably means that there exists – and that humanity will probably find – a\u0026nbspsubstantial population of repeating signals, the researchers write in one of the two papers published in\u0026nbspNature.Having two sets of repeating bursts could also allow scientists to understand what distinguishes them from single bursts, helping them understand more about their source and watch for future blasts.Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemIn all the researchers spotted some 13 of the bursts in just a three week period, offering a vast new trove of data for the scientists hunting for their source. Together they could offer some evidence of the extreme or unusual environment they are coming from – or the mysterious technology that some claim alien civilisations could be launching them into space with.“Whatever the source of these radio waves is, it’s interesting to see how wide a range of frequencies it can produce. There are some models where intrinsically the source can’t produce anything below a certain frequency,” says team member Arun Naidu of McGill University.The blasts were discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment in British Columbia. Some scientists had worried that the range of frequencies it can pick up would be too low for it to receive the FRBs – but it found far more than expected, and scientists expect it to identify even more.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But here we were lucky, and caught this one, and can now study it in more detail.”Even despite being called small by the scientists who found it, the world is still huge compared to us: it is about three times our size, and\u0026nbsp23 times as massive. That puts it in the category of a sub-Neptune, and means that it would be the first roughly Earth-sized planets to have been found by TESS.But it is unlikely to look much like our own planet. It\u0027s probably made of gas like Neptune or Uranus, though something far more dense than their atmospheres.“We think this planet wouldn’t be as gaseous as Neptune or Uranus, which are mostly hydrogen and really puffy,” Dragomir says. “The planet likely has a density of water, or a thick atmosphere.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It was one of those beams of light, thrown out from the quasar, that happened to pass near a galaxy that happened to bend and magnify the light, sending it towards us and allowing it to be seen today by Nasa-sponsored researchers.Black hole spotted by Nasa provides new insight into mysterious bodiesIf it weren\u0027t for this makeshift cosmic telescope, the quasar\u0027s light would appear about 50 times dimmer, said Xiaohui Fan of the University of Arizona, who led the study. This discovery demonstrates that strongly gravitationally lensed quasars do exist despite the fact that we\u0027ve been looking for over 20 years and not found any others this far back in time.Scientists were able to take observations of the light from the Gemini Observatory, along with data from other observatories, and understand where it had come from.When we combined the Gemini data with observations from multiple observatories on Maunakea, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other observatories around the world, we were able to paint a complete picture of the quasar and the intervening galaxy, said Fan.The light came soon after what is known as the Epoch of Reonisation\u0026nbsp– when the very first light came about.This is one of the first sources to shine as the Universe emerged from the cosmic dark ages, said Jinyi Yang of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team. Prior to this, no stars, quasars, or galaxies had been formed, until objects like this appeared like candles in the dark.Quasars are very intense sources of energy that are fuelled\u0026nbspby black holes, and are thought to have been around in the very first galaxies in the universe. They are so bright and distant they can offer a unique glimpse into the beginnings of the cosmos, as in this case.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The key paragraph is 23, which says: “We will … legislate in domestic law to ensure that a UK Minister will be required to seek agreement of the Northern Ireland assembly before reaching any agreement in the UK-EU Joint Committee to add additional alignment provisions to the scope of the Protocol.”What this\u0026nbspmeans in principle\u0026nbspis that, if the backstop comes into effect, the Northern Ireland assembly would be able to block changes to it.Why is there no government in Northern Ireland?The backstop, the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, is likely to come into effect after the transition period – assuming the UK leaves the EU with a deal. Indeed, it is the legally binding fallback in the absence of a long-term trade deal that would achieve the same thing.That is why the DUP doesn’t like it. It objects to the enhanced checks required on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, which it calls a “border in the Irish Sea”. And it absolutely hates the fact that the UK cannot get out of the backstop without the consent of the EU.This last point in particular is also very unpopular with Conservative MPs, and so the prime minister has been trying to find ways of reassuring them and the DUP before the vote of the House of Commons on the Brexit deal next Tuesday.She still seems to be hoping to come back to the House with legal assurances from the EU that the backstop would be temporary, but in the meantime she is doing what she can to try to persuade the DUP and Tory hard Brexiteers.Hence Wednesday’s document, which deals with a long-range detail: what would happen if EU laws change, requiring changes in Northern Ireland\u0026nbspto keep its standards in line with the EU single market?The document says the assembly would have a veto in those circumstances. Unfortunately, that is undermined by the prior commitment in the document to international law, which would include the withdrawal agreement, meaning that changes to the backstop have to be agreed with the EU.So the document is unlikely to change many minds. It has already been condemned as “cosmetic and meaningless” by the DUP.And there is one rather more obvious flaw with it, which is that there is no assembly currently sitting at Stormont, because the devolved government there has been suspended for two years now.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

protecting endangered animals is to consider relaxing restrictions on the ivory trade, prompting fears such a move could trigger a huge rise in elephant poaching.Wildlife experts warned against any loosening of the rules as\u0026nbspseveral African countries pushed to end a near-global ban on sales of the material extracted from tusks.Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe\u0026nbspare all demanding

its\u0026nbspelephants\u0026nbspdowngraded to a category “not necessarily threatened with extinction”,\u0026nbspallowing its ivory to be legally sold.Leaders of the four countries have put their\u0026nbspcontroversial proposals to the next meeting\u0026nbspof the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), to be held in\u0026nbspSri Lankan capital\u0026nbspColombo\u0026nbspin May.\u0026nbspElephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from ivory shipmentsIvory sold illegally across Europe, driving elephants to extinctionUK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantAfrican countries tell EU to ban ivory tradeAfrican elephant numbers have plummeted in recent decades, largely because of widespread poaching for ivory, which is illegally sold to south-east Asian buyers.According to WWF, every year about 20,000 African elephants are killed by poachers for their tusks – an average of one every 25 minutes.Born Free believes that populations have dropped from five\u0026nbspmillion a century ago to fewer than a tenth of that\u0026nbspnumber now.\u0026nbspBotswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe, who argue that ivory trading will pay for conservation, want to sell government-owned stocks of raw ivory.After seeing decades of poaching, Cites banned international sales of new\u0026nbspivory in\u0026nbsp1989,\u0026nbspallowing elephant numbers slowly to recover.\u0026nbspBut\u0026nbspin 1999 and 2008, Cites\u0026nbsplet first Japan, then Japan and China, buy many tons of ivory in experimental sales, which conservationists say\u0026nbspenabled traffickers to again ply their trade because it can be impossible to tell legal ivory from poached.\u0026nbspThe poaching crisis is still acute, and any legal market has the potential to stimulate demand for ivoryToday China, the US and the UK have banned ivory sales but many countries still allow some commercial trade, and illegal poaching has continued despite efforts by African governments to crack down.\u0026nbspCites watchers suspect on balance that the three proposals are unlikely to win the two-thirds majority – of 183 members – needed for them to pass.“There isn’t really any appetite in the international community to agree to this,” said\u0026nbspColman\u0026nbspO’Criodain, a wildlife trade expert for WWF. \u0026nbspBut Peter Knights, chief executive of the\u0026nbspWildAid\u0026nbspcharity, warned that any relaxation of restrictions could lead to a massive rise in elephants killed.He said Cites’ earlier one-off sales had failed to stem demand.\u0026nbsp“Between 1975 and 1989, elephant numbers halved due to poaching and ivory being laundered into the ‘legal’ trade,” he said. “In 2008 the experiment was re-run with similar results – poaching escalated up to 33,000 a year.Surge in African elephant killings for ivory leads to drop in numbers“History has shown that traders find a way to use legal trade as a poaching conduit so we need to use other income sources, such as tourism, to support conservation.”\u0026nbspThe proposals are likely to be opposed by Kenya and Gabon, supported by conservationists, who believe even limited trade fuels demand and drives up killing.\u0026nbspKenya and Gabon want elephants in southern Africa to be promoted from Appendix II to Appendix I, which would mean the creatures were officially considered at risk of extinction.Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa have more than half of Africa’s total elephant populations between them.In October, Botswana’s president Mokgweetsi Masisi\u0026nbspjoined the Giants Club, which aims to\u0026nbspprotect\u0026nbsphalf of Africa’s elephants by 2020.\u0026nbspAs human populations increase, wildlife habitats are under increasing pressure, putting the mammals at greater risk of being killed as they stray onto land where crops are grown in search of food.\u0026nbspIn 2016, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature reported that Africa’s elephant population had suffered its worst decline in 25 years. In East Africa, elephant populations had nearly halved in a decade.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspcensus across 18 countries\u0026nbspalso found that in seven years, 30 per cent of Africa’s elephants had disappeared.\u0026nbspZambia said elephants were competing with people in rural areas for resources and that Zambians would be more tolerant if they see “economic returns earned from the sustainable use of elephant”.\u0026nbspAt its last meeting in Johannesburg in 2016, Cites rejected appeals to relax ivory trade bans, and Matt\u0026nbspCollis, a Cites expert at the\u0026nbspInternational Fund for Animal Welfare, agreed that unless anything substantial had changed, the new proposals would probably not have enough support.Mr Collis said it\u0026nbspmade no sense to sell off stockpiles again when the poaching crisis remained\u0026nbspso severe.Created with Sketch.Campaigners call on Indian PM to end torture of captive elephants Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The treatment of captive elephants in Kerala is branded \u0027India\u0027s shame\u0027\u0027Elephants\u0027 in chainsAt the Indian High CommissionThe protesters were fighting to open the world\u0027s eyes to the hidden crisis, urging people to use the hashtag breakthechainsCampaigners came in elephant masksOutside the High Commission, India House\u0027Elephants\u0027 in chainsThe treatment of captive elephants in Kerala is branded \u0027India\u0027s shame\u0027\u0027Elephants\u0027 in chainsAt the Indian High CommissionThe protesters were fighting to open the world\u0027s eyes to the hidden crisis, urging people to use the hashtag breakthechainsCampaigners came in elephant masksOutside the High Commission, India House\u0027Elephants\u0027 in chainsThe “isive” proposals were a distraction from what the world should\u0026nbspfocus\u0026nbspon: supporting countries to put more resources into elephant protection, he said.\u0026nbsp“The poaching crisis is still acute, and any legal market has the potential to stimulate demand for ivory,” he added.\u0026nbspChina banned ivory trading in 2017, and last year Hong Kong promised to phase out its elephant ivory trade by 2021.Last month a UK law banning ivory sales – with a few strict exceptions – passed through parliament.\u0026nbspBut Vietnam, Thailand and Laos remain big markets.The US has effectively banned ivory deals, and after some wrangling with Donald Trump, US officials now review permits on a case-by-case basis.But the world’s largest exporter of legal ivory is Europe.\u0026nbspIn 2017, the European Commission banned the export of raw ivory, but not products containing it. Just two months ago, officials shied away from introducing a total ban despite respondents to a consultation calling overwhelmingly for tighter rules.Mr\u0026nbspCollis\u0026nbspsaid that in 2010 all African-range countries agreed the African Elephant Action Plan, tackling poaching on the ground and targeting transit countries and markets such as China.Cites has been contacted for comment on the three proposals.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He cited alleged “discrimination” against Poland by Brussels.Austria’s right-wing chancellor Sebastian Kurz last year called for an anti-immigration “axis” using the same language. Speaking alongside the right-wing Bavarian CSU party he cited Italy and Germany as possible allies.Mr Orban’s speech comes as he comes under popular pressure in Hungary, where he is facing sustained public protest against a so-called “slave law” that loosens overtime protections.\u0026nbspMatteo Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister and right-wing League party leader (ReutersAmmar Awad)His party Fidesz still remains the most popular in opinion polls, though it appears to have lost some support.The far-right is expected to make significant gains across the continent in this year’s European Parliament elections, consolidating those it made at a national level since the last round in 2014.The European Parliament elections in part decide the president of the European Commission, with the Council and Parliament making the choice in tandem.Polls suggest that a far-right group could credibly become the second largest grouping in the trans-national parliament – though isions between different parties in different countries could prevent them from coalescing around a single banner.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Philippine Coast Guards keep watch as Roman Catholic devotees cross the bridge in a raucous procession of the Black Nazarene to celebrate its feast day in Manila.

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support.

We aren’t done playing.’”But once his image was released by his rescuers, the world reacted with shock and sadness at the image of Kennys deformed face.He was labelled the worlds ugliest tiger with people saying he looked like a dog rather than a big cat.Commenting on images of Kenny on the refuges Facebook page, one person, labelled tiger inbreeding as one of the most ignorant, abusive acts at playing God that Ive ever seen.And while many claimed he was the first tiger with Downs Syndrome scientists say that, as the condition is caused by an extra copy of a specic chromosome, only animals closely related to humans, such as chimpanzees, can have it.The sanctuary said that inbreeding caused his unusual characteristics.Although tigers in the wild typically live to , Kenny died from an aggressive form of skin cancer eight years after his rescue, at the young age of .Tiger farms are hugely popular in Asia and are quickly turning into a global industry.Often disguising themselves as animal sanctuaries, they look to meet increasing demands for tiger fur, body parts and domesticated tigers to be kept as pets.Skins are turned into luxury rugs, tiger bones are used to make “self-healing” health tonics and wines and the meat is popular with high-flying businessmen, who believe that consuming the cats will improve their performance at work.Shockingly, tigers are often shot through the eyes so that their fur is not damaged.The growth of the illegal farms has driven down the going price of £, for a white tiger cub to just under £,.Elisa Allen, Director of PETA UK told Sun Online: White tigers are not a species but simply an aberrant colour iation of Bengal tigers, and breeding them is done solely to draw paying crowds.All captive white tigers are inbred, which has led to serious congenital defects, including cataracts, clubfoot, and near-crippling hip dysplasia.Tigers are on the very brink of extinction, yet one of the biggest threats they face is the  promise of captive-breeding programmes.None of the tigers born in captivity will ever be released, so these programmes do nothing to help wild tiger populations.If big-cat species are to survive, our focus must sht from breeding and displaying them in captivity to habitat preservation in the wild. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thanks to this Prime Minister, we haven’t a clue how  will start, let alone finish.Chaos is the only certainty as the Government faces parliamentary defeat over her Chequers botch.We might then be in for a grinding marathon of rematches, a crisis General Election, a second referendum or — the only really positive option — joining hands with the rest of the world.Thanks to Brexit saboteur Phil Hammond, the path to those open seas is blocked by tank traps, landmines and treasury barbed wire.Hammond, aided by EU fth columnist Olly Robbins, is the panic merchant behind Project Fear Mark .Unless we accept Brexit In Name Only , abide by EU rules on trade and customs and bow to the European Court of Justice, we will starve to deathwe are not first eaten alive by rats. These are only “worst case” scenarios, you understand.More likely, we would prosper and flourish without a deal and, after a brief period of turbulence, wonder what this bitterness and recrimination was all about.Hammond, who loathes Mrs May and would have been sacked in a flash had she won her catastrophic  election, is now lead blues singer with The Remoaners.When the history of this bungled mess is written, he will emerge as principal villain, the Scrooge Chancellor who blocked every attempt to win a real deal from Brussels.He has waited until too late to unleash a few quid to build ferry and port infrastructure.His motive, shared by the hostage PM, is to drive home the fraudulent nightmares of No Deal at the expense of the national interest.Olly Robbins, a fan of Stalin’s Soviet Union, is the so-called Brexit negotiator who failed at any point in the last two miserable years to wring a single unwilling concession out of Brussels.History’s verdict will be harsher stillwe now end up bogged down indefinitely with BRINO, locked into EU coils without any of the benefits of actually getting out.Brussels doesn’t want us to leave — and they will make damned sure we don’t.The catalyst will be the day Mrs May actually signs off £BILLION to keep the leaky EU afloat while Britain remains shackled to a sinking ship.So far, this vast sum is merely a digital symbol with no immediate impact on the hard-pressed taxpayers who must pay.But once this cheque is cashed, reality will dawn with unpredictable consequences.For there is no magic £billion sitting in Treasury vaults. We would have to borrow it to bail out the EU — while struggling to pay our own bills here at home.Britain has little appetite for social unrest. For the moment, we can look across the Channel with bemused detachment as Paris is engulfed in flames.But .million people here voted for Brexit. They knew what they were doing.The same is not quite true of those who voted to stay.Many were reluctant Remainers. Some would have voted for Brexit, but for George Osborne’s original Shock and Horror. They know better now.They have seen ministers crying “wolf” too often.They don’t believe Theresa May, Hammond, the Treasury or discredited George “Six Jobs” Osborne.No Deal terries Brussels but it doesn’t scare waverers any more.Along with Tory MPs ing fortied by local supporters after the Christmas break, most are braced and ready for leaving the EU on global trade terms.Mrs May is banking everything on a last-ditch deal with Brussels over the Northern Ireland scam.Without it, she — or someone  — must tear up the cheque, hoist the sails and steer Britain out of the EU and into clear blue water.ENERGETIC Health Secretary Matt Hancock wants to make the patchy NHS world class.Here’s one good reason why he must.A friend with a skin blemish was booked for a biopsy in Chelmsford, Essex, last March.Months rolled by.So she paid out of her savings for a biopsy and then surgery after a specialist confirmed cancer and warned delay might have serious consequences.This weekend, NINE months later, she received a letter of apology and an update on her place in the queue for the biopsy.How many patients die before they get a letter like that Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And as this carries on day in, day out, we see no nightmare queues of lorries backed up at our ports.In fact, there is no friction at all at the borders even though much of the “just in time” delivery we depend on comes from outside the European Union.We are not told the Civil Service is ready and prepared to handle a No Deal Brexit. This plan is being withheld from MPs and the British people in order to push Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, which could bind us to EU control indefinitely.Make no mistake, Her Majesty’s Revenue  Customs are ready for a No Deal Brexit. All computer systems will be ready by January  and businesses have been advised about “Trusted Trader Schemes” to keep trade flowing.The EU has announced plans for visa-free travel and aviation rights.The French have installed high-tech scanners at Calais to keep both trade and tourism flowing.Friendly “Open Skies” agreements have been signed with our most important partners outside the EU — the US and Canada. We have agreed transitional trade agreements with Switzerland.There is so much to be optimistic about.As for our trade with the EU, that will not stop evenextra tarfs are slapped on our exports.The EU has a trade surplus of £billion with the UK.In , European countries sold £billion-worth of goods to us — that’s a lot of cars, food and wine they want to go on selling us.It is strongly in Europe’s interests to cut a deal.There are so many advantages of a No Deal Brexit.

We are the fth largest economy in the world.

We would be free to run our economy as we wish, slashing red tape and burdensome regulation.Our friendships across the world with Commonwealth and other English-speaking countries can be re-energised. We have nothing to fear.The risks of staying in the EU, by contrast, are great.The EU has not been an economic success. Its love affair with bureaucracy and heavy taxation hold it back.Its growth rates since the financial crisis have been much lower than ours. Levels of unemployment are so high in some EU countries, no wonder young people there come to the UK where, at four per cent, we have the lowest level of unemployment for  years.As a hotelier, I can say without exception, it is much more dficult to do business in Europe than it is in the UK.The EU’s high corporate taxes, complex labour laws and tricky legal system make Britain’s low taxes and fair laws very appealing.There are so many reasons to be cheerful about our future outside the European Union.But Remainers are not able to provide any positive arguments for staying in.That is why they scaremonger with Project Fear. They won’t listen to the British people.They want to reverse the result of the referendum by almost any means.No one should believe their blinkered view and this country should not be held hostage by it.Britain has always been a world leader.

He knows it is your final one and there won’t be any more forthcoming. But don’t worry. He has passed a motion. And the motion is clear. He completely rules out failing to do a deal with you.I have attended many boring political meetings and witnessed many fatuous ­political acts. Student meetings, tiny party branch meetings, national executive ­meetings of failing political parties, cabinet meetings of governments heading towards landslide defeats.And in all that time I have never ­participated in, indeed never witnessed, anything quite as fatuous or fruitless as voting to insist that we won’t leave the European Union without a deal. It’s not that I’m calm about the prospect of leaving without a deal. Or that I’m willing to support doing so.It’s just that not having a deal cannot be stopped by saying: “I’m against not having a deal”. It can only be stopped by ­agreeing to one.The Tory Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn joined ­forces on Tuesday to make it harder for the Government to let Britain leave the EU without a deal. Their motion was backed by a majority of MPs. But it still has three fairly obvious shortcomings.First, the Government isn’t in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. It agrees there shouldn’t be “no deal”. It has a deal. It is in favour of passing its deal. Second, the Government doesn’t need to be reminded about the damaging ­consequences of leaving without a deal.It knows what they are. Making it harder to prepare doesn’t make the ­Government keener to avoid no deal, because it’s keen to do that already.The third point is the most important one. Among those who argue that no deal must be avoided, there appears little agreement on what the alternative might be. The main sponsors of yesterday’s footling motion in the Commons are admirably open-minded but appear to have no idea how to win the majority of MPs around to their open-mindedness.I suppose these anti-no-dealers think they are warning Theresa May that,her deal is defeated next week, she has to come up with something . But this advice is only sensiblethere is an obvious alternative that stands a ­better chance of passing the Commons. Come on, really, what is that I’ll make a personal point at this stage. I believe that the referendum produced a legitimate outcome that Parliament has a duty to implement. It would be a grotesque failurewe were not able to arrange to leave.I’ve been against a second referendum all along. But even so, I insist that the departure should be orderly. I’m not ­willing to support a calamitous crashing-out, evenit means accepting the shame of failing to implement Brexit.Yet what do the anti-no-dealers offer to someone like me, who ought to be one of their natural supporters  Nothing except the frivolous message that they, too, are against no deal. And a perverse deter­mination to make an ­accidental no deal even worse than it might otherwise be.In those circumstances the only sensible position for me is to back the Prime ­Minister’s deal and urge Morgan, Cooper and Benn to do the same. Let’s look at the options once Mrs May’s deal is defeated in the Commons vote, as it seems it will be.There is the idea that she might be defeated in a no-confidence motion, lose the ensuing election and be replaced by a Corbyn government that negotiates a new deal. Except that a successful no-confidence motion is highly unlikely and there certainly won’t be a new deal, evenLabour got into power.By the way, the Labour Party is now toying with fighting an election, proposing a renegotiation with Brussels which would be followed by a public vote. In this vote, would they back leaving the EU  Or are they seriously suggesting they renegotiate a deal which they then urge voters to reject by recommending we stay in the EU after all Brussels would ­certainly want that. So you would have two sides negotiating a withdrawal ­agreement that both hope would fail. I think we can safely scrub that one off the list of sensible ideas.Next, there is the option of arranging to remain in the single market, in a Norway-style arrangement. This would require support from the Labour front bench to succeed because a lot of Tories would oppose it, evenMrs May agreed to it. But Labour has ­repeatedly resisted this idea. At the moment, a Norway-style deal stands less chance of success than Mrs May’s deal.A more realistic option is that ­Parliament supports a permanent customs union. Shortly after next week’s vote, members of the House of Lords will ­consider the Trade Bill.Peers will almost certainly pass an amendment to the bill, allowing Britain to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. That creates a showdown in the Commons, where it is quite possible, given the strength of support, that the ­Government would have to agree.This would cause turbulence in the ­Government but, crucially, it would allow Labour to support Mrs May’s dealit wanted to — and to get it through the ­Commons. However, I doubt very much that it will want to. Labour only supports a customs union in which we get to decide on trade deals, which is not on the table.Then, of course, there is the possibility of delaying Brexit with or without a ­second referendum. Labour is still ­resisting this option and,it backs it at all, might do so in a form which is impossible to implement, such as ­insisting its own renegotiateddeal be on the ballot paper.In these circumstances, the chance of us accidentally ending up with no deal is very large. It is irresponsible to hinder any preparations we may need to make.We should be thinking harder about how to manage it. What side-deals do we need on things like air travel  Is there any way of agreeing a short transition   What physical preparations are in place Passing motions against such measures is worse than foolish — it’s positively reckless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The aim is to swtly paint her into a ­corner from which her only escape is the second referendum Remainers optimistically believe would reverse Brexit.Bercow, supposedly the gatekeeper of our ancient Commons procedures, defied his officials’ advice and tore up the rule book to make this happen.Why  Because this supposedly unbiased Speaker deludes himself, like the Remain diehards whose dirty work he enables, that he is the dashing hero of a noble anti-Brexit ­insurgency .That’s right: the first “rebellion” to take back control for London’s rich, europhile establishment elite from a public that demanded change and was promised it by these very same politicians.Bercow has violated the impartiality of a historic office which he still holds solely because Remainers disgracefully ignored serious bullying allegations against him to secure his help.But equally dishonourable are those Tories whose weird religious devotion to the EU would now see them sacrice their own Prime Minister, Government, party and — more importantly — the ­stability of our democracy and country.The same goes for Corbyn’s MPs, who lie about honouring the Leave votes of millions of Labour supporters but would reject ANY deal Mrs May produced for one reason: it would mean leaving the EU.We hope the constituents this dismal rabble are busy betraying will make amends whenever an election is called.As for John “B****cks to Brexit” ­Bercow, his prejudices have skewed his judgment, fatally compromised his role, are directly hindering Brexit and have cost him the trust of half the Commons.Time’s up.A BOY of  butchered in the street.

It will force Mrs May to announce her Plan B within three daysMPs vote down her Brexit deal next week. Why did his officials object They pointed to the long-standing precedent that government motions can be amended only by a government minister. Mr Grieve is a backbench MP.How was he able to overrule He claimed he was standing up for the rights and will of the Commons, declaring: “If we were guided only by precedent, nothing would ever change.”Why were Brexiteers angry They accused the self-confessed Remainer of bias which will thwart efforts to deliver Brexit.What does it mean Also during an another day of high drama in Westminster:While delighting the Tory rebels, the Speaker infuriated Brexiteers who insisted on grilling him for an hour in the Commons.One senior eurosceptic, Mark Francois, told him: “I have been here for  years and I have never known any occasion when any Speaker has overruled a motion of the House of Commons”.Refusing to sit down, Mr Francois went on to shout “sophistry” and “ridiculous” at the Speaker.As the chaos worsened, that sparked a counter attack from the Tory rebels, as veteran former Cabinet minister Ken Clarke stood to tell Mr Francois to “don a yellow jacket and go outside”, in a reference to Paris rioters.Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom also demanded Mr Bercow publish the Clerk’s advice, but he refused – insisting it was “private”.After a barrage of abuse, the Speaker finally admitted he had broken long-standing precedent to allow the amendment, but insisted it was only to “champion the rights of the House of Commons”.Saying he was “trying to do the right thing”, Mr Bercow added: “If we were guided only by precedent, nothing would ever change”.A total of  Tory rebels aligned with Labour to inflict the second Brexit defeat on the Government in as many days and the seventh in total.They included  former ministers, and were joined by all but one Labour MP to defeat the Government by  to , a majority of .Mr Grieve said the move is to stop No running down the clock for a no deal, with just  days to go until Brexit takes place.It came as MPs restarted a landmark five day debate on the Brexit deal on Wednesday.Under the previous rules agreed by all MPs, Mrs May had  days to come back to Parliament with a fresh optionher unpopular deal is shot down, as expected.Downing Street said it was “surprised” Mr Grieve’s amendment was allowed to go ahead, as that also contradicted their advice from clerks.But the PM’s official spokesman added: “Our intention has always been to respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward in the event that we lose the meaningful vote, and that is what we will do”.But other Brexiteers insisted Mrs May could shake it off by simply doing the basic minimum.Leading Tory Leaver Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “The vote that the Government has just lost does not affect Brexit.

He didn’t come clean with the House.“He should have been very honest with the House and said I have created a precedent. The onus is on me.“I was very sad as someone who has sat in that chair to see there were points of order, screaming at each other for an hour and a quarter.”Evan Paul Silk, a senior former clerk who wrote the authoritative ‘How Parliament Works’ book, said Mr Bercow’s move had undermined the entire ethos of how the Commons operates.He wrote on Twitter: “Predictability is essential in any rules-based body.“Parliamentary procedure should change, but unilateral action isn’t the way to do it.”He added: “Good outcomes do not justy bad means.”Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom also tore into Mr Bercow to say she was “very concerned” by his unprecedented action.The Cabinet minister told ITV’s Peston show: “My very grave concern is the role of the Speaker of the House of Commons is to beof the rules.“What happened today, the Speaker instead of beingof the rules, decided to unilaterally change the rule.”Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the Tory rebels, ended up negotiating in the Commons with Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary.Sir Oliver asked whether the opposition would work with the governmentthere was cross-party agreement on a customs union and single market deal, which is Labour’s stated preference for Brexit.Starmer later suggested that Labour would enter cross-party discussions “in the right spirit”Mrs May’s deal was defeated.Tory MPs were tonight plotting a fresh bid to oust Speaker John Bercow over his anti-Brexit bias.A group of backbenchers met to discuss how to force a vote of no confidence.It was one of a number of plots being discussed by Tory MPs over how to thwart the Speaker.Another motion proposed would dock ten per cent of Mr Bercow’s £, salary and cut his gold-plated pension - equivalent to half his salary after he steps down.And a third motion being considered would force Mr Bercow to publish all advice and communication between him and his officials over his decision to select the contentious amendment on Wednesday.Meanwhile former minister Crispin Blunt confronted the Speaker in the chamber as he told him his time was up.He told Mr Bercow: “For many of us we will now have an unshakeable conviction that the referee of our affairs, not least because you gave your opinion and your vote on the issue of Brexit publicly, that we we will have an unshakeable conviction that the referee is no longer neutral.“I just invite you to reflect on the conclusion that many of us will have inevitably have come to.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess.

This is just the start of the softening-up process.Brexit: The Uncivil War, a Channel  production that toyed with neutrality, for about  minutes, but had given up any pretence long before the drama’s rather desperate postscript finally stopped trying to nudge viewers in the Remainer direction.The two main characters weren’t entirely subtle either.One, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was Dominic Cummings, the hi-vis dork who was in charge of the Leave campaign.The other, “I’M IN” leader Craig Oliver, whose portrayal, by Rory Kinnear, as a brilliant-but-tragic hero, was rather undermined by the fact Craig Oliver was also one of the drama’s political advisers.What saved The Uncivil War, though, was the acting, particularly Paul Ryan’s Nigel Farage turn, and Cumberbatch, who wasn’t a perfect fit for Cummings as his Durham accent slipped too often.It’s a performance brimming with such mesmerising charisma, though, I can genuinely see The Uncivil War effecting genuine change – two extra zeroes on Dominic Cummings’ next salary.Such is the real power of TV drama.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Prof Israel Finkelstein, of Tel Aviv University, is leading an archaeological dig at Kiryat Ye’arim, near Jerusalem, and believes that it is where the Ark was kept for  years. The Ark, with two stone tablets listing the Ten Commandments, was built by the Israelites as they conquered the Holy Land. It was captured by the Philistines, but after afflicting them with plague and famine, was ed to the Israelites at Kirjath-Jearim. Archaeologists are now almost certain the town of Kiryat Ye’arim is the same place.  Prof Finkelstein said: It fits the detailed description in Joshua. In Byzantine times, historian Eusebius said that Kirjath-Jearim was nine or  miles west of Jerusalem, which this site is. Also the name of the hill in Arabic - Deir el-Azar - preserves the name of the Byzantine monastery: the Monastery of Elazar. According to the Book of Samuel, Elazar was the priest in charge of the Ark. The Ark is said to have disappeared from Jerusalem in the sixth century BC.   And though he has found no evidence of the Ark itself, Prof Finkelstein believes he can shed some light on its true nature. “We are not searching for the Ark. We are trying to understand the Ark narrative, who composed it, when and why. The biblical narrative probably comes from the Northern Kingdomand was seemingly composed in the first half of the th century BC. It probably served the ideological goals of the kingdom at the time, perhaps also its territorial aspirations, namely control over Judah.  Lending weight to this theory is a huge  discovered at the site. Professor Finkelstein said: Kirjathjearim was a typical hill country town, on a peak, with relatively steep slopes. But on the summit there was an elevated , which was probably the location of a temple. Kirjathjearim straddled the border of two ancient kingdoms - Israel to the north and Judah to the south - with excavations suggesting the site was used by the former to control the latter. Against this backdrop, Professor Finkelstein believes the Ark story was invented to give Kirjathjearim religious legitimacy as an administrative centre. It also emphasises a fabled past when the two kingdoms were united under a single ruler, further legitimising ancient Israels rule over its southern neighbour.

Despite of the devastating news, Ms Conarty discovered she was pregnant after three years of trying. And in September , Ms Conarty gave birth to health baby girl, Ava, who is now four months old.   Ms Conarty told Daily Record: Becoming a mum has always been a dream of mine. Ava feels like a little miracle, and even more so after she was diagnosed with albinism. Ava was born with red eyes and white hair. Albinism is caused by faulty genes that a child inherits from their parents.  It affects around one in , people in the UK. The condition can affect their colouring and their eyesight due to the amount of melanin in the body. But Shannon is delighted to be a mum after conceiving against the odds following her painful diagnosis.She says: My weight fluctuated and my oian cysts were causing me a lot of pain. At the time, doctors revealed I had a % chance of conceiving children naturally as my fallopian tubes were covered in cysts. As I was still in high school at the time, I never gave it a second thought.

But miraculously, three years on in January , Shannon discovered she was pregnant. She says: Tom and I were delighted. My pregnancy went without a hitch, but I had extra scans to monitor me.  Baby Ava diagnosed with albinism a month after she was born.Shannon says: We didnt believe it. Doctors told us it was very rare, as children get it from their parents, me and Tom are undergoing genetic testing to see which of us carries the gene. Ava will always have white hair and red eyes. Her albinism makes her more sensitive to sunlight and she is partially-sighted, but we wont know the full extent of this until shes older.  But the tots unusual eye colour draws in strangers. Shannon says: Every time we leave the house, people comment how beautul she is. But despite the admiring remarks, I do worry about her when she gets older. Due to her sight problems, shell be unable to drive and I worry about her being bullied at school. But me and Tom will raise her to love herself as she is. After all, shes our little miracle!

In a major speech, the Labour leader said there would need to be time to negotiate his practical and achievable alternative with the EU as his party would be right up against the clock. He also conceded the partys current policy on Brexit could change ahead of such a public vote.The party leader made the comments as he demanded a general election to bring Leave and Remain voters together to rebuild Britain. He told an audience in Wakefield both sides have rising debts, insecure work and food banks adding: You’re up against it. But you’re not against each other.   But he did not commit to forcing an immediate no confidence voteTheresa Mays Brexit deal is voted down on Tuesday. And evenhe did, its thought the earliest possible date for a general election would be March  - three weeks before Brexit Day. Yesterday Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said extending the date, set by Article  of the Lisbon Treaty, may be inevitable. And today Mr Corbyn confirmed: Quite clearly moving into office, a period right up against the clock, there would need to be time for that negotiation. So what Keir was doing was reflecting the practicalities of how that negotiation would be undertaken.   Article  can only be extendedthe EU gives its permission. Today Mr Corbyn said Labour would use a new left-wing mandate after a general election to negotiate a better deal. But he also conceded that the partys policy - which is to pursue Brexit, and only keep a second EU referendum as one option on the table - could change in a general election manesto, because manestos are made by members and not just him.  He said: Our policy would be to negotiate urgently with the EU as and when we take office. But clearly a general election must come first in order to do that.   Policy-making is made by the Labour Party in a democratic form and that policy will be put together and put into a manesto in any election thats coming up. A general election will be triggered automatically  days after the Tory government loses a vote of no confidence. But in order to win that vote, Mr Corbyn would need the unlikely backing of Theresa Mays allies, the DUP. Allies claimed yesterday a vote would be forced immediately. But today Mr Corbyn saidMrs May is defeated and refuses to call a general election, Labour will table a motion of no confidence in the government at the moment we judge it to have the best chance of success.   Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs at the moment in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock. In his speech Mr Corbyn blasted Theresa May for following Tory dreams of a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump which could deliver chlorinated chicken to our dinner tables and open up our NHS to giant profit-seeking American healthcare corporations. He added people were genuinely scared by the idea of No Deal, which Labour opposes.  And he attacked Theresa Mays olive branch to Labour MPs, an offer to safeguard workers rights, saying unions had clearly and emphatically rejected it.But he also reached out to leave voters. He said: Any political leader who wants to bring the country together cannot wish away the votes of  million people who wanted to leave, any more than they can ignore the concerns of the  million who voted to remain.  He added: Some see the EU as a defence against insecurity and hostility. Others see the EU as part of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility in the first place.  And Mr Corbyn again shot down calls to make a second EU referendum the partys priority. He said: If a general election cannot be secured, and well try, then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote. But an election must be and is the priority.

Now were told there could be one next week, meaning the country will go to the polls in March - just a fortnight before were due to Brexit.And there is almost nothing that could be a bigger disaster for him.For it to happen, there would have to be a massive swing against the government. Such a swing could happen onlythe country turned against Brexit something entirely possible, in this febrile atmosphere. Surveys have shown most UK constituencies now have a majority to Remain.If that happened, hed be the first Labour leader in almost a decade, handed a mandate to rip up the fondest dreams of his arch enemies on the Tory backbenches.A mandate backed just as strongly by Labour voters, .m of whom have switched from Leave to Remain. A majority of both Labour voters and paid-up members of his party also want a second referendum, and at the same time more than half of his partys members have considered quitting it because they oppose Brexit. Just four months ago the Labour Party conference backed a second vote - backed it, more importantly, with a standing ovation for Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer.And this week, , Labour members wrote to him ahead of a policy meeting this week demanding he do more to oppose Brexit. The Devizes Labour Party said people were resigning already and warned of a mass exodus. He is opposed to the Tory deal and last night, he voted to make no deal a financial impossibility.So as a democrat and a man of principle, as a politician and a humanist, and as a man who has opposed both Theresa Mays deal and not bothering with a deal at all on the grounds of the damage it would do, theres only one option left. Hed have no choice but to stop Brexit dead. Which would be awkward, because Our Jezza wants to Brexit with all his heart.  He has said the EU always suffered a serious democratic deficit and said it handed economic policy to an unelected set of bankers. He has complained about its free market, the business free-for-all, its limiting of national sovereignty and growing military co-operation. He voted against further EU integration, over and over again.He basically said a lot of the same things as Nigel Farage, but without holding a pint of beer or being invited onto Question Time.He has tried to change.After he became Labour leader, Jeremy wrote in the FT that we should remain in the EU and negotiate to restore our rights. And in , during a visit to Brussels, he told the BBC: The Labour Party is going to be committed to campaigning to stay in the European Union... when theres a Labour government in , we will be trying to ensure ... a Europe that is based on social justice and good, rather than solely on free-market economics.But he wasnt that committed to Remaining. He went on holiday during the referendum campaign and the evening before the vote held a hustings at Islington Waitrose. He couldnt have been futher away from the Labour heartlands which voted to Leavehe tried. The referendum presented him with the same problem as every other party leader - a large turnout, a small majority, and an instruction to not only deliver a unicorn but one that was red, white and blue.Labour, like the Tories, had its support split between Leave and Remain. Jeremy was presented with a tightrope along which he must tiptoe while appeasing two totally-opposed desires. His problem was made worse by the fact only one of them was possible, and he preferred the other one. But a few months ago his job became easier. Labour voters switched to Remain. His party demanded another vote. His activists want him to oppose. His MPs want him to present a firm alternative to Theresas mayhem. In such a situation, the electoral maths, Parliamantary requirements, and democracy itself combine to present one blissfully-easy path for any party leader to take - to Remain. He took the other one. Not the path that backs Brexit. No, Jeremy chose to stay on the tightrope. To take no sides and then to add immeasurably to his problems by asking to be given an utterly-impossible job AT THE SAME TIME. While trembling above a precipice, he has demanded the heavy burden of premiership be placed on his shoulders. To not only find a cure for the NHS, house the homeless, decide what to do in the event of nuclear war and authorise drone strikes on terrorists in foreign lands - which would be enough to keep Gandhi awake at nights - but to solve the insoluble problem of Brexit, something which has devastated the Tories like political Ebola.This is either stupid or heroic, depending on your objectivity. But take another step back, and youll see its a circle that even this messianic geography teacher is going to struggle to square.  Because as PM, Jeremy would have to do what he has said he will. And he has said pretty much everything. He has said remain, he has said Brexit. He has said renegotiate a better deal, while saying no more free trade. He has called for more responsive democracy, but wants to adhere to what the people said almost  years ago rather than what they say today.He has criticised the Good Friday Agreement, and as PM would be forced to defend it. He gets to dump on the DUP which everyone will enjoy, especially them, but to do so he has to say that supra-national trade, globalism and capitalism is the best way to be free.And to top it all, what hes most recently said is that even though weve spent all this time talking about how we will talk about a trade deal, we want to start again. Trade can wait, and Parliament can be shackled, for a couple of years more.Theresa might be a stupid woman, but I cant wait to see what the lipreaders see him being calledhe tries that.Of course, he might not be PM. He could be a victorious loser, again. On the Opposition benches he can holler and criticise without having to decide, andhis previous positions on Europe are anything to go by, not deciding is his favourite decision to take.Being PM means picking a principle and sticking to it. It means listening to the rest of the country, the party and the Parliamentary party. It means resolving Brexit the quickest and simplest way, so that Labour can get on with unpicking  years of tragic Tory rule.It means hard maths, and putting the countrys wishes before your own. And that is perhaps why he had no confidence in asking for a no confidence vote before Christmas, and why when a shadow minister said thered be one next week it was quickly defined as a personal opinion rather than a party one. Corbyns best interests are served, not by being PM, but by pretending he wants to be, and doing everything necessary to be PM except taking the final step, and filing the paperwork.The problem with that is your, and my, and the countrys, best interests are not being served at all.

And today Mr Corbyn confirmed: Quite clearly moving into office, a period right up against the clock, there would need to be time for that negotiation. So what Keir was doing was reflecting the practicalities of how that negotiation would be undertaken.  The leader conceded its out of his hands whether Labour makes a dramatic sht in policy for an election campaign. Anti-Brexit activists have been calling on him to take a position of opposing Brexit or promising a second EU referendum. And he conceded Labours manesto is effectively written by committee, with scores of reps having an input, rather than by him. He said: Our policy would be to negotiate urgently with the EU as and when we take office. But clearly a general election must come first in order to do that. Policy-making is made by the Labour Party in a democratic form and that policy will be put together and put into a manesto in any election thats coming up. . Labour WILL definitely vote down Theresa Mays deal next week  Eyebrows were raised recently when an ultra-loyalist blog, Skwawkbox, published an analysis saying Labour could abstain on the deal. The logic was that it would allow the Brexit deal to pass, forcing the DUP to join with Labour in a no confidence vote. But Mr Corbyn confirmed: Theresa Mays deal is a bad deal for our country and Labour will vote against it next week in Parliament. . But a no confidence vote might NOT come immediately  Shadow Cabinet ministers yesterday suggested Labour would force an immediate no confidence vote. But without the backing of the DUP, Labour may not have any chance of winning it - and Jeremy Corbyn admitted that. So there could well be a delay. Mr Corbyn saidMrs May is defeated and refuses to call a general election, Labour will table a motion of no confidence in the government at the moment we judge it to have the best chance of success. Clearly, Labour does not have enough MPs at the moment in parliament to win a confidence vote on its own. So members across the House should vote with us to break the deadlock. . He utterly trashed Theresa Mays olive branch to Labour MPs  We revealed the Prime Minister is ready to accept an amendment, tabled by Labour MPs in Leave seats, pledging not to lower any EU standards on workers or the environment. As many as  backbench Labour MPs could back the bid, which supporter John Mann said would make her deal more attractive. But Jeremy Corbyn joined union chiefs and his shadow ministers in comprehensively ditching her olive branch. He said: Its already been quite clearly andemphaticallyrejected by the TUC and leading trade unions. They say it simply doesnt guarantee the protections that we are seeking. We dont endorse or accept what has been put forward and we agree with the TUC and the other general secretaries who have already rejected that view.  Labours leader showed hes not going to give up support for Brexit any time soon - by reaching out to Leave voters. He said: Any political leader who wants to bring the country together cannot wish away the votes of  million people who wanted to leave, any more than they can ignore the concerns of the  million who voted to remain. He added: Some see the EU as a defence against insecurity and hostility. Others see the EU as part of an establishment that plunged them into insecurity and hostility in the first place. . And he still wont make a second EU referendum his priority  Labour activists and some trade union leaders are demanding Labour properly backs a second EU referendum. But Jeremy Corbyn has made clear its just one option on the table, and it looks like he doesnt want to change his mind.He said: If a general election cannot be secured, and well try, then we will keep all options on the table, including the option of campaigning for a public vote. But an election must be and is the priority.

If theres no Brexit deal by March , some documents will no longer grant you access to the EU - eventheyre in date. Thats because EU countries will demand you have at least six months left before your passport expires on your date of travel. That is dferent to the situation now, where you can enter France or Germany evenyour passport only has a week left. Here is the governments guidance for whether you need to renew.   Will my passport be valid after Brexit  British passports will carry on being valid to travel to the EU after Brexit. However,there is no Brexit deal, the UK will be counted as a third country after  March . That meansyou are travelling to Schengen area countries, you must have at least six months left on your passport from the date of travel.  The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. When should I renew my passport   The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. Will I have to pay to visit the EU  If there is no Brexit deal, you will probably have to pay for the privilege of visiting the EU. Short-term trips wont need a visa, but they will need a visa waiver. This is predicted to cost Brits € .  If there is a Brexit deal, the above advice does not apply. UK citizens will enjoy free, unlimited travel to the EU until at least  December , as long as their passports are in date. How will passports change after Brexit   The design of passports will change after Brexit. Passports printed on or after  March  will no longer have the words European Union on the cover. Then, later in , the colour of British passports will change from burgundy to blue.

She changed her job, bought a new house and started renovating the property into her dream home. Despite all this she still wanted more. After a couple of weeks in her new home, in the midst of ripping up the floors and tearing out cabinets, she received an email from her local church about fostering children and her attention was instantly captured.   Katie, who lives in Colorado, went along to the meeting and says what she was told that day about foster care gave her chills. Writing in a post for LoveWhatMatters she said: What I heard that evening about foster care gave me chills and scared me, but it also pulled at my heart in a way I couldnt stop thinking about it. After spending time contemplating the idea, she finally decided to pursue it and in  she completed her application and took the first step on a new adventure. She began looking after children who had experienced trauma at a young age and came to realise she was keen to adopt a child and make things more permanent.   Soon after making this decision she was asked to take in a four-day old baby boy who had been abandoned at a hospital. The child, who hadnt yet been named, had drug exposure, but wasnt showing signs of withdrawal - he was perfect for her. Katie took him home and decided to call him Grayson and for the next  months she looked after the youngster as care workers searched for his biological parents. She explained: No one answered the ad posted in the newspaper or came back to the hospital in search of the boy.   So on the day he turned  months, the adoption became official and Grayson became her son. But not even two weeks after, Katie received a call from her caseworker askingshe could help out with another four-day old baby - this time a girl. Like Grayson, this baby had drug exposure and shed been abandoned at the same hospital - something about these things made the single mum say yes to fostering her. Something was dferent about this one. I know over the next  minutes and subsequent phone calls I made that afternoon, the phrase I know I am crazy but God is telling me to say YES kept coming out of my mouth, she admitted.   So the baby was dropped off at her house - but she soon noticed something odd. She continued: As I reviewed the bracelets on the baby girl, I saw the first name of her mother matched the name Graysons mother had given at the hospital. I continued to review the discharge papers from the hospital and when I came across the date of birth for the mother, I had to take a second look. It looked familiar. Katie asked her roommate to look after the children for a moment, before going off to find Graysons paperwork. She compared the two and began wonderingthe two children could have the same mother.   She texted her caseworker to askit was possible - but they thought she was crazy. However after tracking down and meeting with the baby girls mum, she soon realised that she wasnt crazy at all. The woman confirmed that she had one more child than the country was aware of - a little boy - and the woman shared a strikingly similar appearance to Grayson. The next week, Katie had the caseworker meet with the mother as well and shortly after the encounter her suspicions were confirmed.   Her phone rang - it was her caseworker. Katie, I think youre right, she told her. Her story breaks my heart and I cant believe it but I am % sure youre right and this is a miracle.  minutes later her phone rang again. Now I am % sure. We just found the last name she gave with Graysons birth for a relative of Baby Girl. Katie, who was at work at the time began crying in the middle of the office, she couldnt believe it - the two children really were siblings! She adopted the baby girl, who she named Hannah, and describes the two children as being partners in crime. And their story doesnt end there!  months after Hannah was born, the birth mother welcomed another little boy into the world. Katie has been fostering the third child since his birth and is hoping to adopt him at some point this year to complete her adorable family.

Megan Taylor was on her first bus journey with her disability assistance and dog Rowley when the woman came over to her. Liverpool Echo reports that the -year-old, who suffers from episodic blindness - claims the woman shouted why is there a f****** dog on the bus  Get it off. But when Megan tried to politely explain it was an assistance dog she claims the woman called her a liar. Her reason was because guide dogs are yellow Labradors and your dog is black. Megan, from Merseyside, said: I tried to explain to her that guide and assistance dogs can been any colour and dont have to be Labradors, although Rowley is. She told me I was wrong. ️ I decided at this point there was nothing I could say to educate this woman and that it wasnt worth my time. I instead chose to ignore her while she continued to talk nonsense.   When Megan was  years old she suffered a serious head injury which left her with a catalogue of medical problems. This included episodic blindness - which causes temporary loss of sight. She added: I suffered multiple fractures to my skull in the incident which left me with multiple disabilities and medical conditions including hearing loss, impaired balance, frequent fainting attacks, vertigo, and episodic blindness. I can temporarily lose my sight without warning at any time, which is truly terrying. Even when I can see I become so dizzy and disoriented when walking that I bump into obstacles and trip over things. The incident on January , is not the first time Megan has been abused in public and is now anxious to use public transport.   She said: I dont think Ive ever had a stress free trip on public transport, thats why Im so nervous when using it now. Due to my poor balance and unpredictable fainting attacks it isnt safe for me to stand on the bus or train, but on many occasions I have asked to sit in the priority seats only to be told no, because I dont look disabled. Even after I have shown people my medical alert card and pointed to my Assistance Dog I have been laughed at and told no. On other occasions I have been spat at, stepped over, pushed out of the way and accused of being another drunk youth when losing consciousness due to my heart condition and neurological disorder. Rowley, who is Megans second assistance dog - after her first dog Ruby was forced into retirement after being attacked - helps her with many daily tasks. The two-year-old pup will help Megan retrieve dropped items, empty the washing machine, get undressed and untie her shoes and even phone for help, when she loses consciousness. Taking the opportunity to educate people on what guide and assistance dogs are, Megan added: Ruby and Rowley have given me so much. They enable me to be independent, they give me confidence, and they keep me safe. Theyre my everything. People should know assistance dogs come in many shapes and sizes and are trained to support people with a range of disabilities. They arent just for the blind. Just like a wheelchair, walking stick, or pair of glasses, they are important and vital auxiliary aids and as such are legally permitted to accompany their disabled owner in all public places. She added: Thanks to the confidence Rowley has given me I was able to stay calm when the woman started shouting at me. I try to stay positive and not let incidents such as what happened get me down because I am not ashamed of my disability. Despite having so many negative experiences, I know that these people are the minority. Most people are good and kind.

Joel Mason, , has spoken out publicly for the first time since MoneySupermarket co-founder Richard Mason revealed his heartbreak at finding out the three sons he had doted on for almost  years were another mans. The bombshell only came to light two years ago when a health diagnosis revealed Richard, , had been infertile since birth due to the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. DNA tests then confirmed he was not the biological father of Willem, now , Joel and twin brother Ed. The secret was also concealed from the three boys - however today Joel said he has no desire to finding out who his real father is and has not fallen out with his mother over it. Do you know the family or have a similar story  Email webnews@mirror   He told Mail Online: It didnt hurt me because he hadnt been my dad for a few years. I felt nothing. I havent asked mum who our real dad is, Im sure shed tell me but I dont want to know. Joel, who says he hasnt spoken to Richard for three years, has described him as manipulative and someone who loves attention, although insisted they were not estranged. The Nottingham University student also cannot comprehend why Richard is desperate to find out who their real dad is - even offering a reward for information - when the three boys are not interested.  He added: I havent been speaking to him for a number of years because of his behaviour. Hes a very manipulative man, not the kind of person you want to be with. I started noticing this when I was . But hes still my dad and Im not going to look for my real one. Hes known for two years that hes not our real dad so why do all this now  The student also said his twin Ed is the only one out of the three who is on speaking terms with Richard.   The businessman launched a legal bid against their mother - whom he is orced from - and now lives with new we Emma Louise Jones-Mason, , in Rhos on Sea, Wales. His ex-we Kate has yet to respond to the claims. Meanwhile, Richard appeared on Good Morning Britain this morning and made an emotional plea to his children. He said: Boys, I haven’t done anything wrong at all. I love you and my door’s always open. I’ve got the kettle waiting to go on, a six pack of beer, just come round, you’ll get the biggest hug ever.  Let’s have a cry, let’s just hug, let’s just get back to where we were before. And just have a word with your mum, tell her to stop being so daft. He also confessed he wanted to get a hammer to confront her after the betrayal was revealed. As he held back tears and struggled to speak, he said: When something like that happens to you, you suddenly feel this betrayal, this bitterness and sort of anger you can’t explain. I’m still their dad.   Rather than get a hammer and go and confront her, I thought what can I do  Were a civilised country. Ive always taught them to be straight forward and honest. What you should do is go to the law. It was like being hit by a hammer. It was like the world had just fallen away. I felt like on the one hand I’d just been told I had a terminal illness, on the other, finding out the boys weren’t mine was just very, very hard. Heartbroken Richard almost took his own le after the crushing news he wasnt the biological father of the children.   However he was stopped from killing himself by his love for soul mate Emma Louise, who he married in . Now Richard is planning to write a book about his traumatic ordeal and plans to litter it with clues as to the identity of his exs lover. His story came to light after he launched a legal bid to recover some of the poundmillion orce settlement his ex-we Kate received, and sued for paternity fraud. Kate has since been ordered to pay pound, after a two-year legal case that allowed her to keep the identity of the real father a secret. Richard believes that the same man fathered all three boys during an on off four-year affair Kate, , embarked on in the late s.  But she only confessed to the adultery in , ten years on from their orce, when he confronted her about the children’s paternity. All she admitted was that he was a member of Barclays staff and they met up in a London hotel from time to time when she attended events as a union official. She claimed they had sex on six to  occasions but used condoms and so she insisted Richard must be the dad. Richard believes a possible clue to the identity of the real father is that Kate became interested in Judaism, insisted all three children were given Jewish middle names and refused to have them christened. Although two of the boys still refuse to speak to him, he was overjoyed to receive a sweet text message from the third last month. It read: Dad, as I explained from the beginning you would never not be dad to me regardless of all this.   Of course I’ll stay in touch, that will never change… I’m always here for you too and you will always be Dad. Love you x. Richard said that discovering the boys were not his own left his le in pieces. “You don’t know what’s real and what isn’t – it’s asI’m living in The Matrix,” he said. Richard hopes his book will lead to the mystery man being identied and is also offering pound, for information. He said it was: “Not least for the boys’ sake because they will want to know who their real father is, even , hopefully, they’ll always think of me as their dad.” He added: I still regard them as my boys even though I’m not their biological father, and I miss them so much.

Yellow vulture cameras have new LED infrared equipment and in addition to speeding, can also catch drivers for other offences. This includes not wearing a seatbelt, using a phone, eating, drinking or even smoking behind the wheel. The new cameras are unlike the usual yellow box speed cameras that can be spotted in any town or city across the country. This means that some drivers may not even know when they are passing one. Devon Live reports that the cameras are placed facing oncoming traffic, while an accompanying LED box system is placed around  yards before them. The cameras, which are part of the new Safety Camera Partnership, have started to appear on the streets already. And more are expected to follow around the country in the near future. Heres everything you need to know, as reported by Essex Live.   How do average speed cameras work  The multiple camerasare set at separate locations along a stretch of roadand are synchronised to record the exact time that each car passes using number plate reading technology. Then a computer will work out the average speed between the cameras to determinethe car was over the speed limit. Some people wrongly think that each camera records a drivers speed as they pass each camera before the computer works out the average speed as the car passed every camera - this explains why some drivers think they can speed up between the cameras and slow down as they pass them. But doing this is likely to land you with a fine - the cameras simply record the time you pass them and the computer works out how long it has taken you to pass the distance between them.   Do the cameras work at night  Yes. They are fitted with infra red illuminators to ensure they work night and day, and all weathers. Can the cameras run out of film  No. Unlike some other speed cameras, average speed camera information is saved to a computer. Can the cameras catch motorbikes  Yes. The cameras are equipped to capture all types of vehicles.   If a vehicle changes lanes will they avoid any fines  No. The cameras calculate for lane changes. But this myth can mean people dangerously switch lanes increasing the chance of crashes. If a driver passes more than two sets of average speed cameras in a sequence while over the speed limit, will they be fined more than once  This is unlikely. Only certain cameras in the sequence are usually paired, so where, for example, there are four in a sequence it may be your speed between the first and third that is recorded, or the second and fourth or first and fourth, and so on. But you will not know which ones are recording your number plate at any time. Where there are separate sections of the same road where average speed camera zones are in force, however, a driver would be committing separate offences by speeding through each one. If you are less than  per cent above the limit, will you get a ticket  It has been commonly assumed by many drivers over the years that you will not get a ticket so long as your speed does not exceed the limit by more than  per cent plus mph. This is because of guidance to officers from the National Police Chiefs Council. Several police forces nationwide have indicated that drivers can expect far less leeway, as cameras become more accurate - and the law states that a driver can receive a ticket as soon as they have exceeded the limit, evenit is only by mph.

Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate is currently undergoing renovations, with the royal couple due to move to the ten-bed Grade II listed house in the Spring. The cottage was gted to the Duke and Duchess by the Queen last year, with Kensington Palace confirming the move in November, saying Windsor is a very special place for the couple. The cottage is half a mile south of Windsor Castle, the Queens summer residence, and St Georges Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Now new documents reveal the couples builders plan to add fireplaces, staircases, and a floating floor, but will keep the original floorboards and shutters. The renovations have been revealed in planning documents published by the local council alongside strict conditions imposed to protect and preserve the house.   Insiders now claim the renovations are expected to cost up to poundmillion - double the royal-funded refurb of Anmer Hall for William and Kate. The building work will be covered by the Sovereign Grant - funded by the taxpayer - while the couple will pay for the furnishings. The source also claims Duchess of Sussex has been corresponding with the renovation team regularly. They added the home was being specially designed to ensure that the family has a comfortable country le. A source said: It is a very expensive affair. Frogmore Cottage is in an extremely run down condition and is needing a lot of TLC and heavy restoration to bring it up to standard ahead of the Duke and Duchess moving in date.   As a result, it is set to cost between poundmillion and pound million for the whole project. It is being specially designed to ensure that the family has a comfortable country le away from the hustle and bustle of London where they are living now. The Duchess is very involved in the project and wants a home that is perfect for her, the Duke and her new baby. She has been corresponding with the planning team regularly as to what she wants. Security procedures are also to be tightened up at the site and it is being made secure ahead of the royal arrivals.  Once the work has finished, Frogmore Cottage will be a fantastic family home fit for the Duke and Duchess but it will be like Fort Knox. Now all applications have been approved and work is now quickly being undertaken. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex currently live in the two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace. They are set to move to Frogmore Cottage - once five flats for royal staff - in the spring ahead of the birth of their first child. It was formerly known as Double Garden Cottage, the home is set within Windsor Castles Home Park and faces the stunning and sprawling grounds of Frogmore House, which will no doubt become a more popular stop on the Windsor tourist trail. Plans were approved by Royal Maidenhead and Windsor Borough Council in July for two orangery extensions, and a granny flat above a studio in the grounds of the cottage.   A second listed building consent application was submitted in October, asking for permission for internal and external works [...] and associated landscaping. But there was no further details on the councils planning page at the time, just a note which said it contained sensitive information so documents wouldnt be made public. However, the council planners approved the application last month, and as a result details of the plans have now been revealed. It states the architects have been given permission to remove a chimney - but onlythe roof is repaired in the original materials. It details there will be new staircases and fireplaces and said there will be a new floating floor.   In a planning decision letter Jener Jackson, head of planning at Royal Maidenhead and Windsor Borough Council said: All existing doors and frames [are] to be retained and reused unless agreed in writing. [...] All existing shutters to be retained and all new shutter furniture to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to installation. All floor boards must be retained and full details of the new floating floor will need to be agreed in writing by the local planning authority prior to installation. Kensington Palace declined to comment about the overall costs and the application. But said while the building work costs would be covered by the Sovereign Grant - funded by the taxpayer - all fixtures and fittings would be paid for by the couple. The source said the poundmillion and pound million cost was for both elements combined.   Frogmore Cottage was built in the th century for Queen Charlotte, the consort of King George III. Queen Charlotte used the property as a countryside retreat for herself and her unmarried daughters. Queen Victoria had breakfast at the cottage in  and said it was a place with an immense number of frogs which she found quite disgusting.

The images show bags which are believed to contain medical waste at the Healthcare Environmental Servicesbase in Benton, Newcastle. Horryingly, staff at the centre claim fridges are full of human remains from surgical training in the city - including torsos, arms and legs. Pictures show bags of waste almost reaching the ceiling as months worth of rubbish waits to be incinerated. HES has lost its contracts with  NHS Trusts and NHS Scotland but denied it was responsible for stockpiling body parts, reports Chronicle Live. The loss of contracts caused the firm to collapse and a former employee at the Newcastle centre said waste has remained on site.   A whistleblower took the disturbing images of the bags at Healthcare Environmental Services’ Tyneside plant over a period of  months. He said: “The situation did not improve over months. The backlog was just getting bigger all the time. There are bags of waste all over the shop, you would think that has to be a health risk.” The company allowed bags from hospitals to build up at three of its five disposal sites in Yorkshire, Newcastle and Nottingham. The whistleblower, who said flies are being attracted to the rotting waste, said orange contained high grade clinical waste, like swabs. Yellow and black bags – nicknamed tiger bags – also contained hospital waste, our source said. Those marked HT were full of highly toxic material and had to be handled with care.   The Tyneside plant takes clinical waste from hospitals across the North East and Cumbria. The employee said: “Some days the smell got horrendous. Plant operatives sometimes came in saying they couldnt work because of it. Flies were gathering on the waste which was starting to rot. The waste was coming in on a regular basis – that wasnt the problem – but it was getting stockpiled because it was not getting disposed of in an incinerator. “At the end of the day, HES have been paid to dispose the waste and it has not been done. After seeing the photos, the Environment Agency thanked the Mirror. A spokesman said: “HES has signicantly and repeatedly breached its environmental permits by storing excess waste at a number of its sites.   “We have taken a range of action with the company but they have continued to operate unlawfully. As a result, we have launched a criminal investigation.” HES previously said: “These images show waste stored securely in a dedicated waste facility prior to disposal. We refute these anonymous claims anatomical waste was handled incorrectly. It is disposed of as a priority. No body parts are stockpiled at any of our facilities.” Theagain contacted HES for a comment.

Jo Collings, , says she made police aware of the monsters reign of terror but the media have instead accredited Emma Mills, another of the businessmans lovers. In the final episode of ITV drama Manhunt, which documented Bellfields killings, the focus was on Ms Mills. She was seen helping bring Bellfield to justice for Ameacutelie Delegranges murder in . Emma had called Bellfield the night he killed the French student, asking him to go to Tesco to pick up some milk shed forgotten to buy, butthe call had gone to his voicemail, transmitting to a mast covering the site of the murder.   It put the bouncer at the scene of the crime - and Emmas Tesco receipt from that night, proving she hadnt bought milk, was also used as evidence to cage him. But Ms Collings, of Berkshire, said: Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton has always saidI hadnt given a statement they would have got him eventually, but they wouldnt have known half as much as they did. That was the statement that was responsible for getting the ball rolling. The fact I had the biggest, major part in stopping him - its good.  She told The Sun : We [Emma and I] both went to court, we both gave statements, and between us we got him. Emma was involved in helping bring Levi to justice because of the shopping, but with Milly Dowlers case I was a lot more involved. Bellfield was charged with murder in , some six years after Millys abduction and murder in Walton-on-Thames. He was already in jail forAmeacutelies murder.   But Ms Collings felt Surrey Police did so many things wrong. She added: Even them not watching the other CCTV video, it was a massive f*** up, and there are so many other things they did wrong that werent put into the programme. But its could have, should have, would have - hindsights always a great thing. You cant change whats happened. Leviwas a clever f***er. Hes stupidly clever, but his cockiness was his downfall. I feel sick to know he could have been stopped earlier. Ameacutelie was the final piece of the jigsaw - sadly without her they wouldnt have been able to piece it all together. Manhunt was a three-part ITV drama, starring Martin Clunes, and ended on Tuesday.

With a retained placenta herself, the new mum had to wait an agonising four or five hours before she could finally see little Chloe again. And as soon as she did, she was faced with the devastating sight of her precious child hooked up to machines in intensive care. So when she and her husband Michael spotted a small bruise on the right side of the youngsters forehead, it was the least of their worries. We didnt think much of it, Jean told . But over the next few weeks, as Chloes condition improved, the mark grew rapidly like a strawberry and took on a vivid red colour. As it turned out, it was actually a birthmark.   And in following months, it grew more and more each day, eventually weighing down Chloes eye and becoming ulcerated. Strangers would stare at the little girl in the street, while Jean and Michael had to be careful not to bang the area in case it bled. If it started to bleed, it would continue to bleed, said Jean, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. We had to be careful not to knock it. Told there were no treatment options available and the mark would likely disappear someday on its own, the couple didnt know what to do. But fast-forward to today and their lives - and Chloes - have completely changed, after she was accepted on to a trial for a new treatment. Now aged nine, the brave youngster, who has been left with just a small scar, proudly pins her hair back instead of insisting on a fringe. And she happily tells her pals: Im abirthmarkbaby.  Chloes so proud, said Jean. As she looks back at photos [of her birthmark] shell ask about it. If people ask questions shes very quick to say, I had a birthmark. The little girl was born eight weeks early in August . I had a very easy, straightforward pregnancy, everything went fine. I was getting up for work the morning my waters broke, Jean said. She arrived very quickly at  weeks. It was a normal birth, gas and air. They tried to stop the birth, but there was no stopping it! Doctors let the new mum have a quick cuddle before she was treated for a retained placenta and Chloe was raced to intensive care. It was four or five hours before I could actually see her, Jean recalled. That was awful.  It was around a week later that doctors told her and Michael that the bruise on their daughters forehead was actually a strawberry birthmark. The couple were told it would soon start to change colour and grow. The second week, we could really tell what they meant by the birthmark. It had turned a very vivid red, said Jean. By the time Chloe was allowed home from hospital, several weeks after her birth, the mark had started to grow like a strawberry. Wed pre-warned people about her birthmark and sent photos. They were surprised - more so by how small she was, said her mum. We were very much aware the birthmark was growing each day. A dermatologist said Chloes birthmark would eventually go away, but strangers were already starting to stare at her in the street.   She would be having people standing there, looking at her, said Jean. By December, she started to get a little scab on the birthmark itself. We didnt know what to do. Before long, the birthmark had grown to the size of a clenched fist. The scab on it was just bigger than a p piece, she added. One day, as Chloes parents removed some clothing from her, the scab also came off, leaving behind an infected, pussy area. They ed to the hospital - where their luck changed. A passing doctor saw Chloe and interrupted our appointment to tell us of a ‘new’ treatment being trialled at Great Ormond Street Hospital [GOSH] said Jean.   The family were told the little girl would be a prime candidate for referral. And just weeks later, they were at the London hospital. In subsequent weeks and months, Chloes birthmark was treated with propranolol - which is traditionally used to treat high blood pressure. The medicine, although not suitable for all birthmarks, or haemangiomas, can reduce the amount of blood flowing through them, GOSH says. This can reduce the marks colour and make them softer, while the treatment can also limit the growth of cells, making the marks shrink. It speeds up the shrinking process, Jean explained. She added: Chloe was on the treatment for a year. At its biggest, her birthmark was really starting to weigh down her eye.   It almost looked like a lazy eye all the time. Wed be sat on the Tube and people would just stare. The young kids would want to touch it. She added: Once they ascertained it wasnt growing anymore, they took us off the medication. Over the next few years, Chloe had annual checkups. Eventually, she underwent three cosmetic surgeries which took her birthmark from a circle to an egg shape, then to a slither. We were ecstatic with the results, said her mum. How the scar is now, its like shes just had an accident. But banging her head is exceptionally painful for her.   When she was younger, Chloe would ask her parents to cut in a fringe so it would cover her birthmark. Sometimes, shed wear a hat. She was starting to become a bit more conscious, said Jean. Wed try to tell her its unique, its what makes you special. But today, the little girl is so proud of her birthmark story. She likes to pin her hair back. Shes proud of her scar now. It shows the journey that shes been on, added her mum. Chloe, her parents and her little brother, Thomas, have been supported in their journey by the UK-based Birthmark Support Group. Jean described the organisation - which was set up by parents of children with vascular birthmarks - as an absolute Godsend. Its for any type of birthmark, it doesnt have to be a strawberry birthmark. There are so many dferent types, she said.   [Its great] just to be able to contact other parents or get some advice. She added: Being a first-time mum this was both the hardest and most lonely time of my le, or at least it could have beenit wasn’t for the help and support of the Birthmark Support Group. We were soon put into contact with this group while Chloe was still young and for the first time we were able to share and compare stories with other parents and children and suddenly the world did not feel so lonely. This year, the organisation has been given one charity place for the London Marathon - and Jean has been chosen as the runner. I am overwhelmed and honoured, she said. Determined to give back the support the group gave her family, she has set up a fundraising page to raise money ahead of the April  event.

Plas Dinas Country House in Bontnewydd, near Caernarfon in north Wales, was the Queens sister and her husband Lord Snowdons home for many years at the start of their marriage. The building, which dates back to the th century, was owned by Lord Snowdons family - the Armstrong-Jones family - but has since been turned into a five-star hotel. The building has  en-suite bedrooms, a restaurant, a drawing room, dining room and land, reports North Wales Live. While the home isnt exactly a bargain, the pound, price tag is much lower than most would expect to pay for huge house which was once home to a senior royal.   However there is a catch, as the new owner will have to pay pound, a year and the lease is only for  years. Princess Margaret married Antony Armstrong-Jones in , and he became the first commoner to marry into the royal family in centuries. The couple spent much of their early marriage at the -acre estate while Lord Snowdon designed the setting for Prince Charles’ investiture ceremony, at Caernarfon Castle. They continued to spend weekends at the country mansion throughout their -year marriage, and it is said that locals knew Princess Margaret as Maggie Bont.   But Margaret wasnt the only royal guest, and Prince William visited during his time in the RAF.The mansion - which was later passed to Lord Snowdons half-brother Peregrine Armstrong-Jones - became a nursing home and then a hotel and now the leasehold has become available. A spokseman for Christie  Co, the company selling the property, said: This five-star, award-winning country house hotel is steeped in history and is part of the Armstrong-Jones family estate, where in  Antony Armstrong-Jones married HRH Princess Margaret.   Plas Dinas still retains many family portraits, memorabilia and original furniture. Senior Business Agent - Hotels, Pubs  Restaurants Tom OMalley added: Were delighted to have brought Plas Dinas to the market. The high standard of both accommodation and dining that the hotel offers means that it attracts discerning guests wishing to experience the very best of the Welsh countryside. As a result we expect signicant levels of interest from the market, and a large number of potential purchasers for this historic country house hotel.

The -year-old from Lancashire achieved straight As in her A levels last summer and was only a few weeks into an international relations degree at Kings College University in London. Then in October she began to experience headaches and sickness. At first she thought her symptoms were caused by freshers flu, however a routine eye test said dferently. It led to her being diagnosed withglioblastoma, which is the most aggressive brain cancer in adults.   Following the heartbreaking news, her mum Nicola, , is doing all she can to help Laura achieve her bucket list. This included a trip to Liverpool last month to see Sir Paul McCartney perform in concert. In December for her th birthday, Laura was a guest at Everton Football Club, where she was able to meet the players such as goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.  Nicola told Mail Online: Before Lauras diagnosis, none of us knew anything about brain tumours or how little is spent on research into this disease compared with many other cancers. Now we know that when youre diagnosed with glioblastoma, youre told youre going to die. Theres no effective treatment, as there can be with breast cancer or prostate cancer. Its a death sentence.   When the student applied to join the Royal Navy reserves, the eye test needed for entry showed unexplained swelling in her optic nerve. She was referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital in London where she was advised tofor more tests. The next day she was extremely unwell so Laura asked her mum for help.  Nicola and her younger daughter Grace, , travelled to London and took Laura straight to AE that night. It was at Homerton Hospital in Hackney that Laura had a CT scan which revealed the heartbreaking news - Lara had two brain tumours. The next day after a more detailed MRI scan of Lauras brain, it was identied that she had several more.  Laura had an operation in November at Salford Royal Hospital to remove the largest and most deadly growth. It was then that she was told she had glioblastoma, which is the most aggressive brain cancer in adults. She had chemotherapy and radiotherapy at The Christie Hospital in Manchester in December to try and keep the remaining tumours away. And next month Laura is set to embark on a six-month course of intensive chemotherapy.

Debbie Ballard and Ryan Gford, both , were kicked out of their home in December and spent  nights sheltering in a car park.They say they became homeless after being switched onto Universal Credit when an automatic rent payment was missed and their landlord evicted them, reports Devon Live .The pair are now in emergency accommodation but the damage has been done as they have now lost their unborn child. Debbie said: Losing my baby makes me feel like s**t. I feel useless and worthless. And now I have lost another baby. I was about six weeks pregnant when we were street homeless in December. I had a miscarriage because of all the stress. All we want is a chance for us to be a proper family. Before they were evicted, the pair were living in a flat in the town but were switched onto the new benefits system when they fell out, and Ryan took Debbie off his claim.   They got back together but due to the change in circumstance, they were automatically switched onto Universal Credit. Originally, their rent was paid directly to the landlord but a payment was missed in the changeover and the pair were evicted due to being in arrears. Debbie said: We were living in a flat. It was full of mould and rats outside and we had made complaints to the landlords. Our Housing Benefit was being paid direct to the landlord but when it switched over to Universal Credit he said we were in arrears and served us with a notice and said he would take us to court. The couple say they did not receive letters about the changeover, and before they knew it their housing benefit was stopped and it was too late. Debbie said: Its too late now. We should have been told that before we were made homeless. They said it was because of a change in circumstances. We were without money for eight weeks. We were literally begging and borrowing from everybody we knew. At the beginning of December, we had  days sleeping on the streets because of Universal Credit. We were sleeping in a car park on the harbour. It was really horrible. It was so cold at night. If you go down to the bottom car park near the Harvester pub its warm in there. But theres an alarm that goes off every  minutes for  seconds.  You cant sleep but its warmer. When we were on the streets you felt like you were taking one step forward and four steps back. Now we are in emergency accommodation and we are expected to live on pound a month. I am trying my hardest but I hit barriers everywhere I go. We have to pay pound a time to wash and dry our clothes because theres no washing facilities in temporary accommodation. Everything is really expensive. Its really hard. Ryan said: We lost our home when we were switched over to Universal Credit. Now we are expected to live on a joint sum of pound a month. I want Universal Credit to stop. I think that now Universal Credit is coming in properly its going to get a lot worse. Its going to be a nightmare. Everybody who has a drink or drug habit is going to be shoplting to feed their habits. Debbie and Ryan received support from local homelessness charity People Assisting Torbays Homeless, where they now volunteer.  PATH chairman Kath Friedrich said: There is nothing wrong with the theory of Universal Credit. On paper its fine. But whats causing all these problems is that all these pre-payment, backdated loans are handed out like sweeties to people who do not have budgeting skills while they are waiting for their Universal Credits. Then when they finally get their money all the loans are deducted. Weve got lots of people coming in here who are only getting pound a week to live on.

The infant was in medical distress after being delivered at a health care facility just days after Christmas in a case that has left veteran police officers shocked. The -year-old mother is a patient at the -bed care facility and has been in a vegetative state for more than a decade after nearly drowning, it was reported. In a bid to identy the childs father, search warrants have been issued to obtain DNA samples from men working at the Hacienda HealthCare centre in the US city of Phoenix, Arizona.   Veteran Phoenix police officer Sgt Tommy Thompson told reporters: As a police officer for  years, this is a case that even shocks my conscience, to think that something like this could occur. He added: She was not in a position to give consent to any of this. This was a helpless victim who was sexually assaulted. The mother and baby were transferred to a hospital, where they were in good condition. A solicitor representing the womans family said the baby has been born into a loving family and will be well cared for.   Sgt Thompson said at a news conference that officers went to the facility just before .pm on December  after receiving a call about an infant who had coded. He said the term is used by emergency services to describe a person who is in distress, has stopped breathing and or is unconscious. The mother is unable to move or communicate in her condition. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, west of Phoenix, said the woman is a member of the tribe.  Hacienda HealthCares CEO, Bill Timmons, resigned after the case emerged. The nursing facility said the DNA search warrants have been served. The samples will be collected by swabbing the inside of a persons cheek, said police. Sgt Thompson said a suspect has not yet been identied, and investigators would be collecting DNA for a large number of men. He said he did not knowany of the staff had declined to provide their DNA, adding: People have the right to refuse, but then we come back with a court order, and then they have to do it.  He would not say whether DNA samples have been requested from men who were visitors at the facility. Sgt Thompson said potential suspects were not limited to Hacienda employees. Hacienda employees apparently did not know the woman was pregnant before she went into labour, and police were first alerted when the baby was born, Sgt Thomson said. Professor Kim Kobojek, director of the forensic science program at Arizona State University, told ABC  testing normally takes weeks, but priority cases can be expedited. She added: They could do it within  to  hours.  Ms Kobojek said forensic investigators would already have the mother and baby boys DNA, likely from a cheek swab. She added: Now from those two DNA profiles what is called an in for a paternal profile, or a potential father DNA profile, can be generated. If there isnt a match from DNA collected from a male employee, she said, police can cross-check with a national database against unknown DNA profiles and convicted offender samples. She said investigators may also consider performing a rape kit on the victim. John Micheaels, a solicitor for the womans family, told CNN: The family obviously is outraged, traumatised and in shock by the abuse and neglect of their daughter at Hacienda HealthCare. The family would like me to convey that the baby boy has been born into a loving family and will be well cared for.  San Carlos Apache Tribe chairman Terry Rambler said: When you have a loved one committed to palliative care, when they are most vulnerable and dependent upon others, you trust their caretakers. Sadly, one of her caretakers was not to be trusted and took advantage of her. A source told KPHO KTVK TV that the woman has been in a vegetative state for  years following a near-drowning incident, and she has been a patient at Hacienda HealthCare for at least a decade. Hacienda spokesman David Leibowitz said police started collecting the DNA evidence on Tuesday after the facility got legal opinions it could not obtain the samples itself. Gary Orman, executive vice president of Hacienda HealthCares board of directors, has promised a full accounting of this absolutely horrying situation. He called it an unprecedented case that has devastated everyone involved, from the victim and her family to Hacienda staff at every level of our organization. Steps have been taken to protect other Hacienda employees, said police. A spokesman for Arizona Governor Doug Ducey over the weekend called the reports deeply troubling and said the state was re-evaluating its contract and regulatory authority over Hacienda.

He was listed in critical condition. We are pulling hard for a full recovery. The crash is being investigated by the Florida Highway Patrol.

Robert Kowalski who describes himself as a man-w***e turned to God and says his le has completely changed. The -year-old from Maryland, USA, used to spend his teens and twenties sleeping with dferent girls with no emotional connection. His lestyle dramatically changed in March , when he encountered a spiritual awakening with Christianity which lead him on a journey of celibacy. He took a clean break from sex and dating for six years sheltering himself to ‘avoid sin’ until his cravings for having relationships lead him back to the bar scenes he used to run in .   In , he felt guilty about the mistakes he made and committed to celibacy again. Robert has been abstinent ever since. In October , he re-connected with a girl from his past and they have been dating ever since. He plans to wait to have sex until after he is married. “During my man-w***e days I was a serial dater:. I would sleep with girls quickly and sometimes inadvertently wind up in a relationship. “Because I was evaluating girls from a purely surface levelour connection wasnt deep. “So after not so long I would start feeling trapped in the relationship, attracted to other women, but not able to bring myself to break up with the girl I was dating, so I cheated. “In March of , I had a radical le-changing encounter with Jesus Christ I went from not knowing, or even thinking about, God to being very aware of Him and that He was asking me to follow Him, telling me He had a plan for my le. “After this my le changed drastically and I went from popular party boy to disillusioned Christian trying to find my place in the world.”   Since October , Robert has been dating a woman who has accepted his celibacy vow and he says he will be ready to have sex when he is married. “She understands where Im at and why Im doing it. I will stay celibate until my wedding night. Then I plan on having ALL the sex,” he said. Despite successfully remaining celibate, he has found the journey dficult and he has received some negative comments from strangers who thought he was ‘crazy’ or ‘stupid’. He didn’t let this stop him from achieving his goal and has learnt to ignore those who criticise his decision to stay celibate. He set up a non-profit charity called CityFam through his local church to volunteer with food drives and disaster relief for the poor.  “When I turned my le around, I had to do something with my time and energy, so I dove in head first at a local church. “We did coat drives and food drives, disaster relief and more. The volunteering healed me from my past mistakes and helped me like myself again. “It made me feel proud of myself. I started organising non-faith-based service events for them to participate in. This is what lead me to starting the non-profit CityFam. “My experience has taught me that love equals sacrice. With every shortcut there is a consequence, we might not see it right away but sure enough there is. “Having sex without a real commitment is a community killer. Community is what makes le rich, having a support system, people to inspire and encourage you, things to do and people to do them with. Adding value to others is what builds community.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man 25 who sold kidney","story":"NewsMan, , who sold kidney to buy iPad now bedridden after remaining organ failsWang Shangkun, now , was so desperate for Apples flagship iPod and iPad devices, he decided to sell his kidney in  on the black market in East ChinaShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JAN NewsShangkun sold his kidney to black market harvesters in  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA tech-mad man who sold one of his kidneys to buy the latest iPad and iPhone has now been left bedridden after the remaining organ failed.

Not only was Macca a popular player in his five years at Tannadice, he also had the knack of scoring against Dundee in derbies.Even so, when he was appointed in October, there was barely a murmur of discontent over his United connection.Many others have been on both sides of the street at one time or another and been welcomed by the punters.Going direct from one to the other has not been uncommon either and, strangely, the only time there has been a fuss was with a transfer that was proposed but didn’t quite happen.That was back in the   season when both clubs were down in the old First Division and cash-strapped Dundee accepted a six-figure bid from United for their exciting young winger Neil McCann.When news of the proposed deal leaked out, however, such was the furious reaction from Dark Blues fans, the board had to call it off and, a short time later, McCann, until recently manager, was instead sold to Hearts.At other times, though, players have crossed the street with barely a whisper of complaint.It should be said that was often because the ying fortunes of the teams meant there was little the one losing one of their squad could do to prevent the move.Equally, there have been instances where fringe players at one team were allowed to go. The most notable of that second category came when Tommy Coyne headed to Dens from Tannadice in .Signed by the then-defending champions from Clydebank in  for £,, Coyne could never quite make the breakthrough into Jim McLean’s side.That meant when United’s greatest-ever manager allowed him to head for Dundee, three years later and for £, more, the bigger gamble being taken seemed to be the one by Dens boss Jocky Scott.It proved to be a masterstroke on his part and, not only did Coyne score  goals in just over  appearances, when he left for Celtic in  it was for a whopping fee of around £,.A success heading in the other direction was the Tele’s own Lee Wilkie, who joined boyhood heroes United from Dundee in .Big Lee went on to lt the Scottish Cup in , although by that time he had been sidelined by the knee injury, ironically first suffered in a derby while playing for Dundee, that would end his career.In terms of medal success, Iain Phillip stands as the only man to win a major competition in both dark blue and tangerine.The defender-cum-midfielder was part of the Dundee side that shocked Celtic in the  League Cup Final and, after ending his second spell at the club by joining United in , got winner’s medals in the same competition in  and  – the latter when he started against Dundee in the final at Dens Park.Others to have moved directly from one to the other include Albert Juliussen, Ian Scott, Billy Williamson, Bobby Robinson, Neil Duffy, Beto Naveda and, more recently, Scott Robinson and Paul Dixon, who departed under freedom of contract."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c34a24c46e147.33250561.jpg ","title":"defender andrew davies given chance to seal dundee move","story":"Experienced central defender Andrew Davies will get the chance to earn a move to Dundeehe can prove his fitness to former boss Jim McIntyre.The -year-old was this week released from his contract with Hartlepool, despite having  months remaining on that deal at the National League club.The Englishman was linked with a move north to Dens Park last week to rejoin his former Ross County boss in his bid to engineer an escape from relegation.Now a free agent, Davies is expected to be on the manager’s wishlist and could arrive at training over the next couple of days to join the Dark Blues.Davies was an integral part of Jim’s successful Staggies side, moving to Dingwall in the summer of .He was quickly made club captain there and led the side to the  League Cup towards the end of the following campaign.The former England U  international stuck around at Victoria Park until their relegation last summer.After his release he joined non-league English side Hartlepool United where again he was made skipper after signing a two-year deal.That, though, has only lasted  games and six months after the deal ended by mutual consent on Monday.Meanwhile, Dark Blues youngster Matty Henvey is set to join Cowdenbeath on loan this week.The -year-old goalgetter has made three substitute appearances for the first team this season under previous boss Neil McCann but is yet to feature for Jim McIntyre.The current management are keen for Henvey to get some gametime at a lower level and the Blue Brazil have jumped at the chance to take him till the end of the season.A player who already exited Dens Park this month, Adil Nabi, has joined Greek Super League newcomers OFI Crete.Nabi’s short-term deal at Dens came to an end at the start of January and he’s been snapped up by last season’s second-tier champions in Greece.Their vice-president is former Celtic and Manchester City striker Georgios Samaras.n Tickets are on sale from the club for Dundee’s next match, the Scottish Cup home tie with Championship side Queen of the South next weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee clinch signing of ex ross county skipper andrew davies","story":"Dundee have clinched the signing of Andrew Davies.The centre-half joins the club on an -month deal.Dundee boss Jim McIntyre knows the -year-old very well having spent time together at Ross County.

I’m glad the manager has given me my chance now and it’s up to me to take it.“He had been great with me, he speaks to me in training and it’s been good for me.“There a few of us young boys, some even younger than myself, that can get a chance.“The manager will also bring a few more new players in as well during this window because it’s not really his squad yet and we’ll see what develops.“He’s played me out wide. I’d like to play in the holding role in the middle because I’ve played there as well but, even though the manager has started me on the wing, he wants us to come into the middle and get on the ball there.”Smith has performed well under his new boss at a time when United have been struggling to maintain the momentum they were building shortly after his arrival.The youngster admits that’s been frustrating but believes United are not far away from ing to winning ways on a regular basis.“Saturday was very frustrating. After Ayr and Ross County dropping points we were looking to get a victory but it wasn’t to be.“Partick came at us first half to be fair to them. I thought in the second half we were very good and we can, hopefully, take that into this week against Dunfermline.“There are no bad teams in this league and, at times, you just need to battle it out in games.“We did that in the first half and I think in the second half we showed up better.“We got the goal back in that second half and then had a lot of chances to win the game, we should have been more clinical and finished them off.“We need to keep grinding results out. That’s us a point closer to Ross County now and we need to keep winning games.”"},{"url":null,"title":"search on over distressed woman wearing dressing gown in perth park on new years day","story":"Police Scotland is appealing for a woman to come forward after she came to the aid of distressed woman on New Year’s Day.In the early hours, a woman who was extremely upset and only wearing a dressing gown in South Inch Park, Perth was assisted by this lady.Officers would like this woman to come forward to help with enquiries.

in a Friday night clash that saw the men from the capital make an emphatic statement that they, not United, were the team to beat.There followed a disappointing home draw with Queen of the South and the month ended with another share of the spoils at Dunfermline.Sandwiched in between those stalemates was a Scottish Cup visit to Premiership Ross County that did nothing to boost morale – the Staggies running out big winners by -.Fast forward a year to Csaba Laszlo’s time as manager and it was another season-defining period.The final game of  saw a chance to go top blown when United went down - at leaders St Mirren and, although the New Year kicked-off with a comfortable - home success against doomed Brechin, after that the bottom quickly fell out of their promotion challenge.A trip to struggling Falkirk looked the perfect opportunity to take another three points to keep the pressure on the Buddies.Instead, United crashed to a - loss to the Bairns that has to go down as one of their worst results in recent decades.A trip to Dunfermline had to again be negotiated and only a point was taken.If this time round the cup provided some respite via a - win at Alloa, the month ended with another crushing defeat as Morton visited Tannadice and chalked up a - success that on the day might have been even better for the visitors.That’s why, following the now seemingly obligatory end-of-year defeat when a winning position was blown at Alloa the week before last, Saturday’s draw and below-par performance against the Jags will have alarm bells ringing among fans.Their big hope this time round has to be that, backed by the millions of new American owner Mark Ogren, the new players the manager has already started bringing to the club in the window will give the team a lt.Another home game this Saturday, when Dunfermline are the visitors, will provide a decent opportunity to take three points.With Montrose to follow in the cup and high-flying Ayr to be visited a fortnight on Friday, a win against the Pars looks a must, or those January jitters could again be season-defining."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/01/SeeDundee-1-940x369.jpg ","title":"win experience dundee at its best with seedundee coms big weekend giveaway","story":"Dundee has been hailed as one of the UK#s top tourist destinations — and here#s your chance to find out why with SeeDundee.Dundee#s new visitor website SeeDundee has teamed up with some of the city#s most exciting hotels, restaurants, pubs and attractions to give you the chance of winning the ultimate weekend break in Scotland#s sunniest city.Taking part is easy.Just visit seedundee to find out more, and make sure you#re following them on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"foreign-gangsters-buying-respectable-companies-in-scotland-with-dirty-money","story":"FOREIGN gangsters have bought amainstream Scottish company as a ldquosafe house for their dirty money, according to a senior police financial investigator."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"partick-thistles-craig-slater-aiming-for-a-win-over-falkirk-to-relieve-pressure-on-gary-caldwell","story":"CRAIG Slater is hoping to turn the tide of public opinion in favour of his manager Gary Caldwell by helping Partick Thistle to a crucial win over Falkirk at Firhill on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"is-jermain-defoe-past-it-this-is-what-the-stats-say","story":"THE transfer window has only been open for just over a week, but Scotlandrsquos top sides have wasted no time in bringing new bodies in and getting deals over the line."},{"url":null,"title":"top-10-holiday-destinations-for-glaswegians-this-month-revealed","story":"A HOLIDAY operator has revealed the most popular hotspots Glasgow sunseekersare booking to beat the January blues."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-sign-2m-ivorian-striker-vakoun-issouf-bayo-on-four-year-deal","story":"CELTIC have announced they have signed Vakoun Issouf Bayo on a four-year contract, subject to the Ivorian striker passing a medical and being granted a work permit."},{"url":null,"title":"drivers-abandon-vehicles-after-being-left-trapped-in-glasgow-car-park","story":"UPDATE:Member of the public lsquoforced to direct rush-hour trafficrsquo at busy Duke Street junction amid chaotic scenes.

But we can go back to the incident in September when Calum Spence was struck by a coin.“Certainly for us in Aberdeen that is where it started because Calum is one of our referees.“We don’t have a direct involvement in other incidents, but it has been announced there will be a meeting of the stakeholders.“A meeting is needed with all the groups involved to see where we can overcome this problem.“We’ve got to have less of a ‘them and us’ mentality because we are all in it together and we need to come up with a joint solution.“Referees getting abuse comes with the territory, but with what has happened recently the territory seems to have been extended.“What has happened is unprecedented.

John Dolan was outstanding for the Comets and really proved he’s a class above.“Fortunately, we were able to bounce back with a comfortable win against Kilmarnock Thunder, which sees us progress to the Scottish Cup semi-finals.“We now face either Dundee Comets or Paisley Pirates, so a much tougher prospect all together.”On Saturday’sto league duty, Reynolds said: “On the back of the Kilmarnock result, we’ll now be looking to string together a few wins, starting with Solway Stingrays at home this Saturday.“Despite having some mixed results this season, Solway are more than capable of creating an upset on their day.“We picked up a win in the away fixture earlier in the season, but know all too well that complacency could be costly.“Hopefully it’s not just a win but a good performance, too, as there are some tricky games on the horizon.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr. The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream. For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-academy-pupils-raise-50-for-local-foodbank","story":"PUPILS at Galashiels Academy have helped raise pound for the local foodbank.Youngsters at the school sold donated dresses and formal wear as they prepared for their Christmas dances.And all of the cash was donated to Galashiels Foodbank by head girl Erin Christie and deputy head girl Sophie Birtwistle.Pupil Madison Turner told us: \"Tom Hogg accepted the cheque and enjoyed a chat with staff and students in the Academy.\"A former pupil at the Academy when it was at Melrose Road, Tom was involved in the building of the current Academy building as a surveyor and the visit brought back lot of memories.\"Erin and Sophie, with Miss Hall who led the successful clothing drive initiative, also heard about some of the techniques used by Tom and his colleagues in the early s to build and plan the current Academy building.\""},{"url":null,"title":"top-marks-for-peebles-dance-school","story":"A PEEBLES dance school is celebrating after achieving its best-ever exam results.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-cameron-leigh-griffiths-gets-my-sympathy-but-why-does-he-make-his-life-so-damn-difficult","story":"Itrsquos luck, really, which allows us to show the world whatever our inidual talent handed out at birth happens to be.For example, had I been raised in the Amazon Basin instead of directly across the road from a pub, would my genius, the right word, trick of flicking up a beer mat and catching it with the same hand before it hits the table ever have been discovered There are a select few blessed with such incredible talent that it elevates them above almost all of the rest, an ability which even in an elite field marks them out as someone truly special.Leigh Grfiths is one of them.This is someone possessed with a ridiculous amount of natural talent for kicking a ball with a left foot which could double up as a wand. He should have been one of Scotlandrsquos all-times greats.Many years ago, I took a trip through to Edinburgh to write up a feature on Hutchison Vale, the football club which boasts a ridiculous number of ex-players who went onto play professionally.John Collins, Darren Fletcher, almost everyone who has ever played for Hibs, and Allan McGregor are just some of the graduates. The list goes on and on.While there, I asked who was the most naturally gted player to ever darken the door of Hutchie Vale, thinking it would be Fletcher. The answer I got has never left me.A coach said that it was the young lad who then had only just broken through at Livingston, and was scoring goals for fun, who beat Collins and Fletcher, two modern greats of Scottish football.It was put to me Leigh Grfiths was the best that club had seen but there was a problem. He was something of a lad. Easily led and prone to distraction.And Irsquom putting it mildly.Just the other day someone I respect in football said to me that Grfiths should be playing for a team at the top of the English or German league. Hersquos that good, this man said and he knows what hersquos talking about.But with Grfiths there is always a but.He denied this week he is a gambling addict, insisting his problem is with mental health issues. If this is  per cent true, and I suspect it is not, I sympathise. I suffer from depression and know how much it can affect the le of anyone. I wish him well.But ndash that word again ndash this fragile and complicated character who while deserving of our best wishes is really pushing Celtic. I am beginning to think hersquos played his last game for the club.Grfiths has been warned time and again to live properly, live better, get fitter, and to an extent he has done. But itrsquos not nearly enough.He should not have been at a Newcastle Racecourse in a bight red lsquolook at mersquo jacket seemingly putting on bets. He shouldnrsquot have been posing for pictures. Not right now, not when he is off for ldquoongoing issues while being paid handsomely by his club.It may seem like Irsquom kicking a man when hersquos down, please believe me thatrsquos not the case, but the last thing someone in his position needs is more hassle, which of course he got online. He responded which only added to the initial regrettable headlines.How many chances is he going to get  Not every penny has dropped. The heid has never been fully screwed tight. The next piece of silliness was never far away. Itrsquos ashersquos as good at self-sabotage as he is at scoring goals.Grfiths is troubled but has a good heart. Itrsquos just that he is man seemingly incapable of dragging himself clear of chaos. Hersquos the pal who can get into an argument and then a fight while putting out a milk bottle. Trouble finds him and this now -year-old has to take a lot of responsibility for that.Grfiths loves Celtic. But maybe it is time for him to leave.

Having bonded with Cave and guitarist Roland S Howard, this time Reekie made sure he had his camera.More than three decades on, some of the photographs he took that night and over the next few years in London and Berlin can be seen for the first time in Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn, Reekiersquos -page zine-like collection belatedly launched next weekend at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow.ldquoLooking at the pictures again brought a lot back to me, says Reekie. ldquoI can remember the chaos and the aggression of the shows, but not any aggression in the people. I was really surprised to find everyone in The Birthday Party was so articulate, well-read and literate, and yet onstage it was almost like everything was stripped away to the most basic bones of absolute nihilism, and almost hatred for the audience. They got into a lot of fights that I witnessed, but after the show once things had calmed down, they relaxed with a bottle of bourbon, and you could chat with them about James Joyce or Dostoyevsky.The idea for Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn came after Reekie put some of his hitherto unseen archive on social media, and was approached to contribute to an exhibition in Los Angeles called Nick Cave Smoking. Reekie submitted four prints, one of which sold for . As Reekie puts it, ldquoIf someone in LArsquos willing to pay that for something Irsquove just got lying in the cupboard, maybe I should think about doing something.ldquoIrsquove always thought of doing an exhibition of my archive, but never got round to it. The book has already travelled as far afield as America, Japan, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia, Scandinavia and Canada. Itrsquos never going to make me a millionaire, but I feel quite validated by that.Reekiersquos images capture an unguarded sense of ease amongst Cave and co, with the band captured backstage making their own mark on the back of a torn-down Sad Cafeacute poster. Despite a strung-out demeanour that foresaw the self-destructive effects that heroin would have on the band, there is a sense of camaraderie at play, with Cave and Howard in particular looking like brothers in arms. It was a bonding perhaps caused by the absence of bassist Tracey Pew, who was serving a prison sentence. This necessitated Howardrsquos brother Harry stepping in.ldquoIt was chaotic, says Reekie. ldquoHarry had never played onstage before, and you could tell that Mick Harvey, as the only non-drug taker in the band, was trying to keep everything together.Later images reveal a haunted-looking Howard captured with his post Birthday Party band, These Immortal Souls. Elsewhere, a now solo Cave looks increasingly messianic. While Pew was dead by the end of  and Howard passed away in , one of Reekiersquos fondest moments is of offering Howard, his then partner Genevieve McGuckin and These Immortal Souls a bed in his flat following an Edinburgh gig.ldquoI went through to take Roland and Genevieve tea in the morning,rsquo says Reekie, ldquoand they were both sitting up wearing matching silk pyjamas, and were so polite in a way that no Birthday Party fan would believe.Sadly, no pictures of this myth-busting incident were taken.While he continued to take photographs, Reekie went on to become a music journalist of note, writing for Esquire, GQ and Loaded after that side of his career was kicked off in s Scottish music magazine Cut. The cover image of Reekiersquos book was taken in the Groucho Club, where Cave held court about his newly published novel, And The Ass Saw The Angel.ldquoThat was my first cover feature for Cut, Reekie remembers. ldquoI wanted to do the photographs for it as well, but they got Gavin Evans to do them.Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn is the first in an occasional series of photobooks produced by Stereogram Recordings, which have released albums by the likes of The Eastern Swell, James King and The Lonewolves and The Cathode Ray. It is also the latest example of an ongoing unearthing of photographic archives from a pre-digital age that document often hidden histories of the post-punk era.This came to prominence in  with What Presence!, an exhibition and book of lost images by Glasgow-based former Sounds photographer Harry Papadopoulos. Produced by Street Level, What Presence! featured images of the Sound of Young Scotland era of bands, including Orange Juice, Altered Images and Fire Engines. Revealed! was a similarly styled document of the same era in Liverpool by Francesco Mellina, who photographed the likes of the late Pete Burnsrsquo band, Dead or Alive, and the post-punk scene based around Ericrsquos club.The Scene Inbetween and Untypical Girls are two volumes of DIY images taken of bands and fans in the s and s collated by Sam Knee, and which feature several images by Reekie. In a similar vein, former journalist turned AR man Ronnie Gurrrsquos Hanging Around Books has launched an ongoing series of booklets featuring never before seen seen images of the likes of Simple Minds and the Skids.As the age of the archive runs on, Reekie himself has thousands of photographic negatives in storage. These include shots of Edwyn Collins and Roddy Frame performing at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh, and of Sonic Youthrsquos Kim Gordon alongside Lydia Lunch in their short-lived duo, Harry Crews.ldquoI reckon wersquove got enough to do another seven books, Reekie speculates. ldquoI could do one of early s club le in Edinburgh. Thatrsquos more about the people who were there rather than the bands, which might appeal to people of a certain vintage who were around then.It is this sense of empathy that makes Sometimes Severed Heads Must Burn such a crucial document of its era.ldquoItrsquos a step back in time, says Reekie, ldquoand because itrsquos all fly on the wall stuff, you can see therersquos a trust there, which the people in the pictures didnrsquot have with a lot of people at that time.

This is a government that has done its level best to curtail debate, to withhold information from this House and even had the courts compel them to allow us to have a vote on leaving the EU.ldquoIt was only successive votes of this House that got them to reveal vital information about their Brexit deal. Itrsquos a government that has been found in contempt of Parliament. Itrsquos absolutely right they are stopped.Mr Wishart commended the Speaker for putting the rights of MPs first and warned ministers: ldquoIf this Government wants Government versus Parliament, it will be on the losing side because we are now in the majority.In response, Ms Leadsom stressed how it was the Speakers role to \"uphold the rules that Parliament has made for itself, not to arbitrarily change those rules\".She explained that yesterday was not about Parliament taking back control but, rather, about a number of MPs, who had tried to put amendments to the business motion and were told it was unamendable and undebatable.ldquoThe role of the chair is to uphold the rules that Parliament has made for itself not to arbitrarily change those rules. So, yesterday was not an example of Parliament taking back control, it was an example of a dferentiation between those members who were told that it was unamendable and undebatable, and those who were told dferently.\"Mr Bercow then intervened to declare: \"There was nothing arbitrary about the conduct of the chair yesterday.\"This Speaker is well aware of how to go about the business of chairing the proceedings of the House because hes been doing so for nine and a half years.\"I hope colleagues will understand when I say that I require no lessons or lectures from others about how to discharge my obligations to Parliament and in support of the rights of backbench parliamentarians.\"The Speaker added: \"I have been doing it, Im continuing to do it and I will go on doing it, no matter how much abuse I get from whatever quarter its water off a ducks back as far as I am concerned.\"He piped up again after Mrs Leadsom reiterated that she was advised that the controversial amendment by her Conservative colleague Dominic Grieve \"would not be selectable\".The Speaker intervened a second time to stress that it was his responsibility as chair to select amendments.\"It is a matter for the representative and champion of Parliament, it is not a matter for a representative of the executive branch, who is the executives representative in the chamber of the House of Commons. Ill do my job and other people can seek to do theirs,\" he insisted.Earlier, Ms Leadsom confirmed the Government would abide by Mr Grieves amendment, which asks it to outline a revised Brexit plan within three sitting daysthe PMs deal were defeated. The normal process, as outlined in law, requires a statement within  days of the deal being rejected and a motion being tabled within seven days thereafter.\"Of course the Government will do so, the Prime Minister has shown her willingness to alwaysto this House, at the first possible opportunity,there is anything to report in terms of our deal and we will continue to do so,\" added the Commons Leader.Because the House is not sitting next Friday, then the deadline for Mrs May to make a statement on a Plan B would be Monday January . Her statement is likely to be made on this day with a debate and vote following in that week.The Governmentrsquos understanding of the Grieve amendment is that this debate would last only  minutes and only one amendment could be submitted. However, given the strength of feeling on the Brexit issue, MPs are likely to object to a debate lasting only  minutes.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Thursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy. With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Thursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118855.jpg","title":"Oldest reactor is set to go","story":"WORK is expected to start at Dounreay early in the new year on a multimillion-pound contract to dismantle Scotlands oldest nuclear reactor.The contract ndash understood to be valued at around pound million ndash has been awarded to Cavendish Nuclear following a tendering process and is expected to last about three years.

The following autumn links were formed with Moray Firth Radio and a restricted service licence was applied for to enable a temporary broadcast in the area.In October , the first broadcast took place.

It is crucial that all political parties use the upcoming budget negotiations to correct our country’s course.Just over a year from the passing of the Child PovertyAct and following the damning assessment of poverty in the UK from the United Nations’ Rapporteur, we had high hopes of the draft Budget.The Scottish Government has made tackling poverty a top priority, but platitudes and promises are not always making the transition into real, funded policy to transform people’s lives. Rhetoric does not help youyou are trying to decide whether you can afford to take a bus to work or pay for your child’s lunch.While ministers are right to restate their commitment to building more affordable homes, expanding childcare and helping parents into the workplace, we will not solve poverty merely with reannouncements of existing policy.It’s unacceptable so many children are living in poverty in Scotland – and the forthcoming Budget negotiations must right that wrong.Living in poverty can affect every aspect of family le. In the recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report into poverty, we spoke to a single mother, Hazel, in Fe who is a care assistant with two teenage children.She told us: “If I compare things to an object it would be a hamster’s wheel. No matter how hard I work and how much I push myself, I still feel I am getting nowhere.”Too many families in poverty are faced with impossible choices, balancing paying the rent with the cost of childcare and being able to get to work, as essential costs rise. Every decision is finely balanced – do you buy fresh food or put the heating on  Everywhere they look, families can be restricted and restrained by poverty – but we know it can and must be solved.: One in four children living in poverty as childcare woes and disabilities biteOpposition parties will now play a key role in shaping the final Budget put before Holyrood and together, the parties must ensure the proposals avoid a step back in its fight against poverty.The Scottish Government now has an increasing range of choices about how it raises and spends money. But local government delivers critical support for low-income families, such as housing provision, local bus services and out-of-school care. To keep these families from being swept into poverty, they need adequate funding. Councils have been faced with continually squeezed budgets for day-to-day spending on existing services with little,any, recourse to tax-raising powers.Council tax reform will rightly be a key area of the budget negotiations. Currently, our evidence shows that falling behind with council tax, and harsh recovery of the money that is owed, is one of the key causes of destitution – where people regularly lack the ability to keep a roof over their head, feed themselves and keep dry and clean. Any reform to the system must ensure that there is a proper anchor for low-income households in dficulty so that they all receive the support they need.There are steps ministers can take now to ease the strain on household budgets. First of all, a quick and much-needed fix would be to increase the thresholds for the council tax reduction scheme in Scotland. This would ensure that working families in poverty are able to keep more of what they earn before they are asked to pay towards their council tax. Doing so could buy the Scottish Government and partners the time they need to develop and implement long-term reforms.: Gordon Brown warns of growing child poverty crisisSecondly, social security is another key tool that the Scottish Government can use to loosen the grip of poverty, and families should not have to wait until  for the income supplement to be paid. We would like serious consideration of delivery of an interim solution that is fully funded by Scottish Government but paid locally, using the expertise of councils in this area. As well as helping people who desperately need a step up now, it would provide genuine insight and learning before permanent rollout in .Finally, our labour market is not working for hundreds of thousands of Scots. There is much that Scotland’s business owners and managers can do to get the best out of their workforce by providing compassion, flexibility and security to allow people to build a le free from poverty. But fair work requires a supporting infrastructure that the Scottish Government must do more to provide.To make progress on labour market equality for women at work and boost their incomes requires further targeted investment in accessible, affordable and flexible childcare that can respond to the realities of the local jobs market, particularly in lower wage sectors. More investment in employability services is vital in breaking down physical and mental barriers, especially for those with long-term health conditions or disability. The Scottish Government also needs to look seriously at whether transport systems and concessions support those who need help the most. We all want to live in a society where nobody is worrying how they will get by from one day to the next. The true test of this Government will not be its words but its actions to support the poorest children in our society.Emma Congreve is senior economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4853765.1547033296!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond accused of vendetta against senior civil servant","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Alex Salmond has been accused of mounting a #personal vendetta# against Scotland#s most senior civil servant, after he called for Leslie Evans to quit her post as a result of the #unlawful# way the Scottish Government dealt with sexual misconduct complaints against the former first minister.Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA trade union which represents senior civil servants, claimed Mr Salmond had “continually targeted” the Scottish Government Permanent Secretary.He hit out after the former SNP leader won a procedural case against the Scottish Government over its investigation into sexual harassment allegations brought by two women - with Mr Salmond warning that the ruling at the Court of Session in Edinburgh could leave the taxpayer with a £, bill.In a ruling on Tuesday, Judge Lord Pentland declared that the Scottish Government’s actions were “unlawful in respect that they were procedurally unfair and that they were tainted with apparent bias”.: Sturgeon apologises after flaw found in Salmond investigationThe person who investigated the complaints had some involvement with the two women prior to being appointed investigating officer, it emerged.Mr Penman told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme that it had “only come to light late in the day” and was “not necessarily” a resigning matter.But Mr Salmond repeatedly called for Ms Evans to quit her post, claiming she was responsible for the “institutional failure” in the handling of the complaints.He demanded: “When she has got some time for mature reflection, I hope that the Permanent Secretary considers her position.”Mr Salmond added that on a “day of abject humiliation for the Scottish Government that seems to me like a correct and proper response”.But Mr Penman said: “I think what has been disappointing is the way Alex Salmond has continually targeted Leslie Evans from day one on this case, he’s called it the ‘Leslie Evans procedure’. Yesterday he made repeated assertions that she should resign.“He has always portrayed this as a personal vendetta, even going as far as suggesting the Civil Service was acting without ministerial authority, so it was no surprise yesterday that Alex Salmond would therefore call for Leslie Evans’ resignation.”He added: “Confidence in the Permanent Secretary is a matter for the First Minister. I’m sure when Alex Salmond was first minister that is what he would have said and I don’t think anyone could be in any doubt from what Nicola Sturgeon said yesterday that Leslie Evans retains the confidence of the First Minister.”Ms Evans took the decision to settle the court case “with my support”, Ms Sturgeon said, after it became clear that the investigation had been “flawed” in “one procedural respect”.She also made clear that she has not been in contact with her former mentor since July .Ms Evans has already said an internal review will be carried out into the way the complaints process was handled, as she stressed that the Scottish Government had “acted in good faith at all times”.The Permanent Secretary said: “It is also important to note that the procedural flaw in the investigation does not have implications, one way or the other, for the substance of the complaints or the credibility of the complainers.“The judicial review was never about the substance of the complaints, but about the process that took place to investigate those complaints.”The Scottish Government could reinvestigate the complaints, but both Ms Evans and Ms Sturgeon have said that will only take place after ongoing police inquiries into the allegations have concluded.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4854537.1547130555!/image/image.jpg","title":"fmqs nicola sturgeon denies intervening in salmond inquiry","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has revealed she informed the Scottish Government#s top civil servant about a series of meetings with Alex Salmond to discuss his sexual harassment probe.But the First Minister insisted that she did not “intervene” in the conduct of a inquiry into her predecessor which dramatically collapsed at the Court of Sessionin Edinburgh this week over “procedural flaws” in the way it was carried out.It also emerged at First Minister’s Questions today that Ms Sturgeon’s chief of Staff was present at the first of three meetings she had with Mr Salmond. Two phone calls also took place, where details of thecase were discussed. The SNP leader continued to insist that the meeting was not government business.: Salmond says plotters trying ‘to remove him as political threat’The First Minister faced claims that her meetings with Salmond, while the case was ongoing, was a breach of ministerial rules.Opponents demanded a Holyrood probe into the role Ms Sturgeon played in the Salmond inquiry and called on her to back this.But she insisted: “I’m satisfied that I conducted myself appropriately in line with all the rules.”Ms Sturgeon revealed the extent of her contact with Mr Salmond on Tuesday during a statement to MSPs.She met with him in April  when he told her, for the first time, that a sexual harassment case had been launched in January. It emerged today that Liz LLoyd, Ms Sturgeon’s chief of staff, was present at the meeting. Salmond also set out his concerns about the process being followed in subsequent meetings. Ms Sturgeon said she had not initially told the Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans of the Scottish Government of the first meeting to avoid an appearance of seeking to intervene.But she changed her position when Salmond requested a second meeting.“I told the permanent Secretary that I knew about the investigation, about the previous meeting, including the reference to a potential legal challenge - I told her I supported her decision to investigate and I would not seek to intervene in the investigation in any way.”The Permanent Secretary was also told about all subsequent contacts.The First Minister also said she made it clear to Salmond she would not intervemne in the process.“I did not intervene in the process,” she told MSPs.Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw told Ms Sturgeon she should have declined to meet Mr Salmond after the first meeting.He dismissed claims that the meetings were not Government business.“Her position appears to be that a meeting between the First Minister of the Government and the former First Minister of the Government about a Government investigation involving two Government employees was not Government business,” he added.Ms Sturgeon insisted that Ms Lloyd was present in her role as a politically-appointed special advisor who has the ability to advise on party issues.Labour’s Richard Leonard accused Ms Sturgeon of a “grave error of judgement” and a “clear potential breach of the ministerial code of conduct.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4853583.1547020090!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon apologises after flaw found in alex salmond investigation","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has issued an apology to the women at the centre of sexual harassment claims against her predecessor Alex Salmond after he won a dramatic court victory against the Scottish Government.Salmond called on Scotland’s top civil servant, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, to quit following the collapse of the government’s case at the Court of Session in Edinburgh yesterday amid flaws over the way allegations concerning the former SNP leader were investigated.There are now concerns that women may be discouraged from coming forward to report future harassment as a result of the “procedural flaws” that brought down the government investigation yesterday.The case is likely to cost taxpayers somewhere in the region of £, in legal bills after Salmond was awarded full costs. He has also declared he is also considering suing the government he once led.But the allegations themselves, dating from Salmond’s time as First Minister, have not gone away. Salmond’s case focused entirely on the fairness of the government’s procedures and will have no bearing on a separate police inquiry into the ­allegations, which is still ongoing.The police inquiry has already seen a number of Scottish Government officials and SNP staff interviewed.Ms Sturgeon is facing awkward questions after it emerged she had a series of meetings and phone calls with Salmond during the inquiry where he set out his “concerns”.The SNP leader said she did not feel “under pressure” to intervene despite confirming she had met with Salmond three times after complaints were made against him.Two of those meetings – one on  April and the other on  July – were at her home in Glasgow. The other took place on  June ahead of the SNP conference in Aberdeen.Ms Sturgeon told MSPs yesterday: “I want to express my regret in particular for the dficult position that the complainants have been placed in.“I can only imagine how dficult the decision to raise concerns, as well as the publicity around this investigation and the judicial review, must have been for them in recent months.“They had every right to expect the process to be robust and beyond reproach in every aspect of it, to reach a lasting conclusion. “I am sorry that on this occasion, this has not been the case.”Ms Sturgeon revealed she had not spoken with Salmond in almost six months. She spoke to him by phone on both  April and  July.The case against Salmond came to light in August after two complaints were made in January of last year.This followed a new procedure introduced by the government toinvestigate harassment claims following the fallout of the global #MeToo movement.Salmond immediately challenged the process used and won his case yesterday after it emerged the government’s investigating officer Judith Mackinnon had previous contact with the women involved about their complaints.Lord Pentland found yesterday this was “unlawful” and may have the appearance of bias.Salmond was accompanied in court yesterday by former SNP justice secretary Kenny MacAskill and former Holyrood presiding officer Tricia Marwick.He said afterwards: “The last time I was in that court it was to be sworn in as First Minister of Scotland.“I never thought it possible that at any point I would be taking the Scottish Government to court – and therefore while I’m glad about the victory which has been achieved today, I’m sad that it was necessary to take this action.“The consequences are very clear. Because the process has been agreed as unlawful, as unfair and tainted by apparent bias, then the Scottish Government have had to concede on the case and the expenses to the maximum extent.“That is going to raise a cost to the public purse of many, many hundreds of thousands of pounds.“And all of this was unnecessary because throughout the process we offered mediation, legal arbitration, so that this matter could be properly settled without having to come to the highest court in the land.“At every stage that was rebuffed by the Permanent Secretary.”Salmond added: “I suggest the Permanent Secretary now accepts that responsibility and considers her position.”He described the Scottish Government’s climbdown as an “abject surrender”.Ms Evans, who established the procedures which were used to investigate Salmond, refused to quit.But she apologised and ordered a review into what went wrong.The climbdown came after the government had issued a series of robust statements insisting it was ready to defend its position in court.“The full picture only became evident in December  as a result of the work being undertaken to produce relevant documents in advance of the hearing,” Ms Evans said yesterday. “I want to apologise to all involved for the failure in the proper application of this one particular part of the procedure.“There is nothing to suggest that the investigating officer did not conduct their duties in an impartial way.“Unfortunately, the interactions with the complainants in advance of the complaints being made meant that the process was flawed, however impartially and fairly the investigating officer conducted the investigation.”Ms Evans said the court case was “never about the substance of the complaints”, but about the process that took place to investigate those complaints.“It is accordingly open to the Scottish Government to re-investigate the complaints and, subject to the views of the complainants, it would be our intention to consider this,” she said. “However, this will only be once ongoing police inquiries have concluded.”Civil service union the FDA called for the case to be reopened. General secretary Dave Penman insisted the fall of the case was down to a “flaw” in the way it was conducted.“It does not challenge the process itself or make judgement on the substance of the case,” he said. “In these circumstances, subject to the wishes of the complainants, we would call on the Scottish Government to re-investigate the complaints at the most appropriate time.” But there are growing concerns the collapse of the case could stop future victims coming forward.Tory MSP Annie Wells said: “At the centre of this entire affair are two women whose complaints against the former First Minister have now fallen apart thanks to the incompetence of the Scottish Government. It’s a complete shambles. The Permanent Secretary has apologised for her role in this fiasco, but it is Nicola Sturgeon who must take responsibility.”She added: “Her government has presided over a mess which only risks discouraging women from coming forward in future. It is a disgrace.”Labour’s Pauline McNeill said: “We must not forget that this case is fundamentally about women and the bravery it takes to come forward to challenge powerful men and powerful institutions. The Scottish Government must take steps to ensure this could never happen again.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"a","story":"SOME lucky folk had an amazing view of a pod of killer whales off west Unst last Friday. A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often.

And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams. In a tribute Mary Lou said: \"Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann agus mara dúirt Jer féin go  minic an Phoblacht abú.\"Deepest sympathy is extended to Jer’s daughters Noraand Clare and to all his extended family.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27512  ","story":"The attack at Burntollet Bridge. Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonIt is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.Peoples Democracyemerged as one of the constituent parts of the wider Civil Rights Movementin the north of Ireland during the late s.It was a collective of radical students influenced like the rest of the emergent CRM by global events and motivated by a resolve to bring an end to the injustices of the then unionist state.Inspired by the political example of the Selma to Montgomery march organised by the American CRM, the PD and notably without the approval of the wider CRM, decided to march from Belfast to Derry in a highly symbolic protest against the denial of democratic and civil rights in the north.The march began on st January and eventually arrived in Derry on Saturday th January .  But, not before it was violently confronted by unionist extremists, supported by members of the B-Specials state militia, as it passed through Antrim town and Randalstown in South Antrim, and then most notoriously at Burntollet Bridge, outside Claudy and finally again at Irish Street in Derry, before finally arriving at the citys Guildhall.and Brackareilly, near Maghera.Where the route of the march was blocked by unionists, local people provided transport to the next clear point on the journey.Among the numbers to join and support the marchers as it passed through South Antrim and South Derry were local republicans, including IRA volunteers and members of the then Republican Clubs local Hibernians, social democrats, as well as other progressive minded people, who recognised the importance of the march, and respected those participating. The Long March to Derry as it came to be known made its own historic contribution to the demise of the old unionist regime in the north of Ireland.So to mark this landmark event, fty years on from the actual date of the ambush on the marchers at Burntollet, Sinn Féin in my South Antrim constituency organised an evening of reminiscence and political discussion, compered by the author and Sinn Féins former Director of Publicity, Danny Morrison.A specially produced video by Noel and Noel Óg Maguire was shown, sharing local peoples eye witness accounts and recollections of what happened in Antrim, Randalstown, Toome, and also at Burntollet.Civil rights veterans, and former Sinn Féin MLAs, Mary Nelis and Mitchel Mc Laughlin, and myself then participated in a  discussion.That reviewed the pre-civil rights period, how the CRM came into existence, and how the civil rights era gave way to the political conflict, leading up to the peace process, and the present day political situation.It was an excellent event, with an audience spanning three or four generations from South Antrim and South Derry.Some present were reconnecting with historical events which they helped shape, and which in turn shaped them: others were of an age to draw parallels between their own contemporary experiences of rights denied today with the denial of rights fty years ago.What the Long March to Derry in , and the sequence of other events of that same year, climaxing with the pogroms of August , brought sharply into focus was that partition remained the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society: and, that the denial of civil rights in the north was, and remains inisible from the denial of Irish national independence. Following the RUC assault on the civil rights marchers in Duke Street, Derry, on th October , the Long March to Derry again exposed for a world audience the institutionalised sectrarianism of the northern state, and extent of unionist opposition to the equality and rights agenda.Nothing would ever be the same again.It took a further thirty years before the Good Friday Agreementdrew a line under the use of political violence provided the political architecture of the Irish peace process and, established in legislation equality and human rights for all citizens in many ways the GFA addressed what the CRM did not resolve.It gave expression with an internationally binding treaty to the crux of the CRM agenda, by establishing the bench marks of equality, rights, and respect for all citizens.It became our societys road map away from the legacy of political violence towards the achievement of a rights based society, with parity of esteem, mutual respect and anti-sectarianism, at its core.Both the British and Irish governments have failed to fully implement the GFA.Just as the unionist state in  opposed the CRM, signicant sections of political unionism have pushed back against the GFA since .It is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,  a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.And, that is the fundamental reason why the democratic political institutions in the north remain suspended and why the GFA faces its greatest ever threat.Make no mistake, there is a deep systemic crisis in the north of Ireland.Now that crisis is deepening with the onset of the Brexit catastrophe.Brexit has swept away all of the previously established assumptions about the constitutional, political and economic status quo in Ireland north and south.A solution to the depth of this crisis will only be found through negotiation and decisive political leadership, which commands the authority to make and keep agreements, and embrace and deliver change.Those who marched from Belfast to Derry fty years ago this week were a microcosm of the wider CRM.They were students and others, including, republicans, social democrats, communists, socialists, trade unionists, and labour members. They were from dferent religious back grounds, and none.The timeless lesson of the CRM which applies to our current situation is that the type of progressive alliances which stood up for rights in  are still required today in .We need progressive and democratic alliances to defend the GFA to stand up against the scourge of Brexit to achieve a Bill of Rights and, secure the fundamental language, legacy, marriage, and womens health rights which are enjoyed where in Ireland and Britain.The British and Irish governments should not make the mistake of underestimating the momentum for change which exists, or the expectations of nationalist and other sections of progressive opinion.We have come full circle. The extremists within political unionism must not be allowed to hold back change.The days of second class citizenship are over.The post civil rights generations will never again be pushed to the back of the bus.Fundamental change in relations between Ireland and Britain is now unavoidable.Importantly, progressive and democratic alliances will also be required to persuade and convince a majority as to the desirability and achievability of an agreed, constitutional Irish national democracy, which guarantees a future for all our people based upon rights, respect and reconciliation.A year of new challenges lies ahead in .Those aspiring for maximum change must remain focussed upon the bigger picture. There can be room for complacency. The momentum for change must not relax. needs to be a year of more and louder voices, greater advocacy, and increased popular mobilisation for democratic rights and change.Let us all ensure that  echoes to the clarion call of those iconic words...We shall overcome.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8760014.1546853768!/image/image.jpg","title":"traffic and travel delays after collision approaching co antrim roundabout","story":"Motorists are being warned to expect delays after a collision approaching the Seven Towers roundabout in Ballymena.A post on TrafficwatchNI said: \"#CoAntrim getting reports RTC #Ballymena approaching A Seven Towers R`bout - expect delaysin the area\".Traffic jamA later post said: A delays from #Antrim direction - Ballee Roundabout towards Ballymena - road down to one lane while vehicle waits for recovery.NI Kegworth survivor: I could hear Stf Little Fingers in coma but just couldn’t come out of it Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Not initially aware of his good fortune, the two cash-strapped women learn that their patient won’t be around for long and are then faced with a moral dilemma of should they or shouldn’t they… Long time Marie Jones collaborator Katie Tumelty told Daily Belfast how the play has a “universal voice” in its themes that are as prevalent today as when the play was first performed back in .“This play deals with the working woman, in this case two care workers who are running to and from the people that they care for on a daily basis,” she said. “Their work is invaluable to so many families but in the cases of Frances and Loretta there is more going on behind the scenes. Marie’s play deals with poverty, death and dilemma but at the same time has so much humour running throughout it.“Both characters are hard workers, they have stresses in work, stresses at home and they are just trying to make ends meet and get through their working day. I play the character of Frances who looks at the same sky as everyone  every morning, has hopes, aspirations and it’s like many peoplethe situation arises – what to doa small amount of money, should it be £ or £, comes their way, do they take it “What starts out as a tiny grain of sand soon becomes an avalanche for the two women to deal with. The piece is Marie at her finest,” she added.Katie continued: “Everybody knows a Frances or a Loretta, they are going in and out of hundreds of home every day to help those in their care. I remember so many times being stopped in the Kennedy Centre with people saying that the show should be on prescription, that Marie should be getting her wages through the NHS such is the tonic the show has proven to be.”Fly Me To The Moon and its message have been welcomed around the world on stages in New York, Canada, Sweden and most recently Iceland.“For this run I’m performing with Abigail McGibbon and it’s like a homecoming for her as she performed the part back at the start. It’s great to be bringing the show to the Grand Opera House main auditorium for the week and we will be touring down south once the curtain comes down on the .“There is no doubt that those coming to see it will leave with a message and huge laughs in what is a very current, relevant piece of theatre.”Fly Me To The Moon will be performed at the Grand Opera House from January  to .

Geri Cameron, president of the National Association of Head Teachers in Northern Ireland, said: “It is totally unsatisfactory, parents have had a very strong voice in telling us that it is not sustainable.”The budget for schools has reduced by about % in real terms over the past five years.The union leader added: “Schools are now at crisis point.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Rancour between the two main political parties over Brexit means it has been months since substantive political talks aimed at restoring devolution have happened Charlene Brooks, chief executive of Parenting NI, a family support organisation, said families were expected to buy extra items like stationery and contribute to the cost of particular lessons.“Parents have made it very clear that this has had an additional financial and emotional strain.“They talk about a voluntary contribution butone parent does not make it does that mean that their child is left out of a lesson and is more vulnerable to being picked on “Does that mean that that child stands out from the group “There appear to be much greater expectations on parents to pay towards things that they would not have to in the past.”It is unsustainable, the rates system no longer worksHospitality Ulster chief executive Colin NeillFacebookTwitterA spokeswoman for the Department of Education said % of the total budget for day-to-day running costs went towards funding schools and pupils.She added: “However, the department fully acknowledges the financial challenges facing schools and continues to make the case each year for additional funding, based on an analysis of the financial pressures facing the sector.“That said, we do not determine what the final outcome will be each year, as the education pressures are considered alongside other competing pressures across all departments.“Overall budget allocations to departments must be funded from available resources and are decided by ministers.“To benefit pupils, all grant aided schools are entitled to request or invite voluntary contributions from parents.”Endless rounds of political talks have failed to restore the Stormont institutions.An official probe into the Renewable Heat Incentivescheme and its threatened massive overspending is due to report later this year.The DUP wants to re-enter Government immediately but refuses to meet a republican demand for official protection for the Irish language.The unionist party’s stance against abortion and same sex marriage has rankled with its former partner in Government.Meanwhile, tourism chiefs are awaiting a long-overdue reform to cut red tape, and the tax burden on pubs contributed to one closing every four days last year, Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said.He added: “It is unsustainable, the rates system no longer works.”Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been unwilling to introduce full Direct Rule from Westminster, but has passed a budget to keep public services running and intervened in piecemeal fashion in policing and addressing the legacy of the conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"researchers aim to prevent delays in smart phone data use","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election. But I enjoy a challenge and I hope that my constituency work on the ground spanning the past  years will stand by me as we approach polling day.Cllr Quinn said there was much more work to be done and he trusted that the public willboth him and his party colleague in the Mournes area to continue with this vital task.He added: ldquoI look forward to continuing to represent the needs of the public at council and ensuring that nobody is left behind.South Down MLA Colin McGrath paid tribute to the ing local government candidates. He said Cllrs Devlin and Quinn had worked tirelessly for the people of the Mournes throughout their tenure on council.ldquoAs they both quite rightly say, there is still a great deal of work to be done. Ultimately, that is our goal, the betterment of our society for the common good, he said Mr McGrath.ldquoTo win hearts and change minds to build up a culture of inidual and societal reconciliation. That has always been the mission of the SDLP and Laura and Brian are champions of that cause.Last week, it was confirmed that the party had rubber-stamped a number of its election candidates, with Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor mdash Dermot Curran mdash set to defend his seat in Downpatrick, alongside colleagues Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor.In Slieve Croob, current Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin will be out to defend his seat, with the SDLP choosing Hugh Gallagher, from the partyrsquos Castlewellan and Kilcoo branch, as his running mate.Party stalwart Terry Andrews is the sole SDLP candidate standing in Rowallane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Drumamness GAC Scór team aim for glory in Ulster final  ","story":"A DRAMA group from Drumaness GAC are one step away from being crowned Ulster Scoacuter na nOg champions.Eight young people from the club will take to the stage in Silvberbridge, Co Armagh, on Saturday night with their play about Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington, a renowned suffragette who led the fight to secure Irish women the right to vote.While  marked the th anniversary of the suffragette movement, it also marked the th anniversary of Scoacuter, a celebration of all that is good in Irish music, dance, singing and story-telling.The Drumaness team, who will be taking part in the novelty act, or Leacuteiriuacute, category, is made up of boys and girls aged between seven and , who donrsquot appear to be phased at all by the level of attention they are receiving.Club spokesman Kevin Brennan said they had ldquonerves of steel in reaching the Ulster final where five other acts from Co Down will be competing in other categories.Victory for Drumaness will secure them a place in the All-Ireland final in Castlebar, Co Mayo, in February.Kevin said: ldquoDrumaness Leacuteiriuacute or novelty act, will follow in the footsteps of their Scoacuter senior teams who have competed in many Ulster finals, some of who are now their mentors and bring with them some great experience and knowledge as they bid to win an Ulster title.ldquoI would like to wish all the clubs taking part the best of luck on Saturday but especially Drumaness, who are an exceptional group as they go forward to represent their county in an Ulster final..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 9%2C 1979  ","story":"SNOW mdash Heavy snow blizzards lashed the locality this week and weathermen say that yet more snow could fall before week is over.Downpatrick and coastal areas from Strangford through to Newcastle escaped the worst of the snow, but Carryduff, Comber, Ballynahinch, Dromara, Saintfield and Ballygowan were not so lucky.However, many parts of the district, including Downpatrick, were thrown into darkness when a transformer in Killyleagh caught fire. An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour. Jousting is a distinct possibility and so are a number of other unusual dimensions.Although it will be called St Patrickrsquos Festival, the steering committee believe that a Maytime date would be better favoured by the weather than one on March  and would allow them to provide a much wider range of outdoor and indoor attractions.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Stormont Minister is to be asked to prevent the extension of a caravan park near Killyleagh.The unprecedented step is being taken by Down Council in protest against a recommendation made by planners to allow the development at East Down Yacht Club. The council are unhappy about the reasons given by the planners to allow the development to proceed.NEWCASTLE mdash The International Nile Canoe Expedition mdash which includes  year-old Newcastle man Marcus Baillie mdash is making signicant progress and more than a third of the death-defying trip has been completed.Two signicant firsts have been achieved by the eight-man expedition team which has already reached Khartoum in its bid to complete the longest continuous navigation of the mighty African river.Marcus, a former Down High School pupil, is hoping to complete the harrowing journey within the next three months.No-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus, who now lives in Liverpool, admitted before he left that the trip would not be easy.Despite many warnings from locals, few crocodiles were seen and the herds of hippopotamus provide much less troublesome than the mosquitos.The team are now battling slowly northwards against a strong head wind towards the famous cataracts and Egyptrsquos Aswan.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A burst water main in the Castlewellan area brought about a dry Christmas for scores of local families.There were also fears the sudden drought could spread to Dromore and Banbridge when the water mains burst between Tullymurray and Mayobridge. Because of the work to rule action by watermen, it meant the problem was not dealt with for several days.As a result families living near Tullymurray were without water since Christmas Day.PORTAFERRY mdash Stage two of a new sewerage scheme for Portaferry is expected to get underway in May and should take four months to complete.The Department of the Environmentrsquos Eastern Division Water Service has announced that the second of three contracts is now being advertised and work will involve the construction of a pumping station. The scheme is designed to improve the existing sewerage system in Portaferry.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Camera Club will hold its first meeting of the new year tomorrow night and has appealed for anyone interested in photography to come along to the townrsquos library where the special speaker will be Stanley Matchett, of the Daily Mirror.The aim of the club is to help amateur photographers to develop their hobby by way of of talks, slide and film shows and processing demonstrations. There will be monthly and seasonal competitions, as well as trips.CARRYDUFF mdash Carryduff residents are to meet soon with Castlereagh Borough Council members to discuss facilities in the Carryduff area.

Joe is a very experienced performer, both as a solo artist and fronting his own band.A lot of the experience that shows through in Joersquos personal appearances was picked up during a three-year period touring the working menrsquos clubs circuit in England, Wales and Scotland, where he appeared alongside a great many of the artists regularly seen on television.SPORT mdash Outdoor sporting organisations, already facing fixture backlogs due to rain, snow, ice and frost over the past number of weeks, are now facing another problem mdash how to find petrol to get them to their matches.Most clubs find themselves in the predicament of not having the petrol to travel to away games and already one soccer league has decided to postpone all of this Saturdayrsquos fixtures, even though it throws the fixture list into further chaos.Soccer clubs have already been hit severely by weather conditions over the past number of weeks and now some are hoping that the governing body will see fit to extend the season into May.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with. People should not have to constantly watch their step while out walking and while many dog owners are careful to clean up after their pets, there are those who donrsquot care.Cllr Walker said improving the districtrsquos cleanliness was at the heart of the new campaign.He said that while reminding dog owners to clean up after their dogs was important, one way of dealing with the problem was hitting them in the pocket with a fine.He added: ldquoI have always said dog owners who break the law should be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and still hold this view. Letrsquos hope that when this new campaign is launched it will be a success and help tackle a problem which is a scourge on this district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street traders need consulted about scheme  ","story":"A LEADING politician has backed calls for improved communication with Downpatrickrsquos business community following a series of pre-Christmas incidents.Over  spaces at the Irish Street car park were temporarily unavailable at what is traditionally the busiest trading week of the year after contractors sealed off an area to allow a large lorry to deliver granite paving stones.The move left business owners furious and to compound their frustration, several spaces in Irish Street were sealed off to allow the large lorries to safely turn into the car park.Contractors also arrived in Market Street just days before Christmas to replace a section of granite paving which led to minor disruption, while much of the nearby Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water due to flooding.The granite paving was being transported to Downpatrick ahead of work starting on Monday on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street.Politicians described the temporary loss of parking spaces just days before Christmas as ldquoextremely unfortunate and insisted that traders should have been told what was happening.This week, South Down MLA Colin McGrath confirmed he has written to business owners in Irish Street traders in the wake of the pre-Christmas debacle.He said: ldquoThe situation which arose in the run-up to Christmas was something of a perfect storm. Part of Irish Street was sealed off, spaces in the nearby car park were temporarily unavailable, contractors were working in Market Street and much of the Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water.ldquoThere were ious causes for these issues from early delivery of stone pavements for Irish Street works, flood water in the town and emergency work to kerbs, but we must have better coordination between authorities and there must simply be better communication with businesses in the town.Mr McGrath said he has written to businesses and forwarded his contact details should there be further issues as a temporary one-way traffic system comes into operation in Irish Street during work on the environmental improvement scheme.ldquoI have also written to the districtrsquos isional roads manager outlining my concerns. Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers. We need to ensure there is enough resource to accommodate ferry traffic flow and demand to minimise the impact on Strangford residents.Cllr Billy Walker suggested the provision of a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry should perhaps be considered.Cllr Enrightrsquos motion was also supported by Cllrs Willie Clarke, Jill Macauley and John Trainor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Mahon Cup success for disciplined St Michael’s  ","story":"THE final of the long-standing Mahon Cup was played out before an appreciative crowd in the Drumaness clubrooms just before Christmas.In the final were holders St Michaelrsquos from Downpatrick and Queenrsquos Hall from Newtownards.League sponsor Gary Rodgers conducted the draw for the match pairings, which saw Gareth McKeever up first against Alastair McDonald and Bobby Douglas taking on Keith Lemon.McDonald got into his stride the quicker and soon built up a good lead over Gareth at  points to .

There was no school reputation, no building, no funding, no resources. They were unbelievable and were really pioneering.Naturally delighted with the honour mdash the first in her family mdash Mrs Roulston says that she shares it with a lot of people.ldquoThroughout my career, I have worked alongside so many wonderful and dedicated people, committed to making a dference to the lives of the children and to ensuring that they received the very best possible education in the widest sense of the word mdash teachers, assistants, dinner ladies, caretakers, volunteer parents and members of the board of governors, etc, she said.ldquoSo, on the day that I receive my MBE, I will be paying honour to all the people I have known and worked with and all those from other schools and sectors who show dedication and commitment to the children in our schools.The little people who she had the pleasure of teaching until she retired in  will always have a special place in  year-old Mrs Roulstonrsquos heart.ldquoI would like to thank all the children, those I have taught and also those whom I had the pleasure of knowing for all that they have taught me, for the pleasure they have given me throughout my career, for all the funny things they said or did which brightened up my day, for their kindness to me in all the drawings and little hand-made crafts they made for me.Originally from outside Manchester, Mrs Roulston has lived and worked in the south Down area from the late s after marrying her husband, Mervyn.After teaching practice in England and teaching in two very dferent schools in France, Mrs Roulston taught for some years in Greyabbey and Portavogie Primary Schools, as well as the Rupert Steiner School in Belfast, before taking a career break while raising her three sons mdash John, Peter and Timothy mdash in Kircubbin.ldquoI did a lot of cross-community work at that time as chair of the parent and toddler group, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoI also formed and chaired a community association and did a lot of work together cross community to get facilities for Kircubbin. It wasnrsquot a paid job but it was an important part of everything and I believe itrsquos where I first understood that cross-community work was so important.While working in Portaferry Primary School in the late s, she was fascinated on learning about a group of parents in Carryduff campaigning for an integrated primary school.ldquoI was reading all about it in the local newspaper and it was very interesting to me, but it was hot and heavy as well as there was lot of objection to the school, she said.ldquoI never dreamt that I would apply for it or have anything to do with it. But I did apply as it was a teaching principalship and it was working with both sides of the community as all the work I had done with cross-community work just kept saying to me, lsquoThis is really important work, this needs to be done to break down barriersrsquo.The road to establishing Millennium was far from smooth, however, as the grandmother of three can testy.ldquoYou just wouldnrsquot believe the terrible trouble we had and itrsquos hard to believe now what happened, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoDays before we were due to open, I had  primary ones and no funding and no site as there was a lot of opposition to establishing the school where we had originally planned to in the Carryduff area.ldquoWe ended up down at Breda Park, close to Forestside in Belfast in an old heath trust building. We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However, I do prefer to buy and shop from local family businesses.And for all those curious about Veganuary, are taking part for the first time or are interested in finding out more, Ms Thomas will be holding a VeganJanuary fair in Penarthrsquos Paget Rooms on Sunday, January  from pm to pm.There will be a iety of stalls including Melrsquos Kindness Kitchen Vegan Cheeses, Lottiersquos Vegan Bakery and more.For more information, search Absolutely Fabulous Vegan Fayres on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged.

The A will provide passengers with a level of comfort and convenience that makes flying a pleasure again, while meeting Delta’s high standards for efficiency and reliability.” Gil West, Delta’s chief operating officer, said: “These additional A aircraft will continue to strategically enable Delta to refresh our fleet, drive further advances in the customer experience and serve as an excellent investment for our customers, employees and shareowners for Delta into the next decade. “We look forward to taking our first A- in  at the Airbus assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
