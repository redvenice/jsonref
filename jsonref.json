The striking similarity of the piercing light-blue eyes was one indication that art experts had, for decades, got the wrong brother.Willem van Gogh, the great-grandson of Theo and an adviser to the museum’s board, said he was surprised, but pleased the mystery had been solved.“It is essential that Vincent van Gogh’s legacy is correctly passed on and preserved and this research makes a significant contribution to such efforts,” he said.The photograph of “a 13-year-old Vincent” was first made public in 1957 at an exhibition organised by Mark Edo Tralbaut, a Belgian Van Gogh researcher.The image was used around the world. “The question of whether it could be someone else never came up,” said Teio Meedendorp, a senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum. “There was never any immediate cause for doubt, precisely also because the boy in this photograph bears similarities to the portrait of the 19-year-old Vincent.”That certainty was questioned in 2014 in a Dutch television programme which used experimental technology to suggest that they could be two different people. The museum began its own research and concluded the 19-year-old was definitely Vincent.Independently, the writer Yves Vasseur had begun to doubt the identification of the younger portrait after discovering, by chance, that the photographer who took it, Balduin Schwarz, only moved into his Brussels studio in 1870, when Vincent was much older than 13.He shared his doubts with the museum and they collaborated on the subsequent detective work. They discovered that Theo lived in Brussels for a time in 1873 and had, according to letters, a portrait photograph of himself taken when he would have been 15.Researchers said both Vincent and Theo had reddish blond hair and looked alike. Theo was a little more slender with more delicate features and lighter eyes.“The lighter colour of Theo’s eyes is especially striking in the known photographs of him,” said Meedendorp. “This can also be seen in the Schwarz portrait. This was another indication that the person in the portrait is probably Theo.”The photograph has also been examined forensically at the University of Amsterdam’s Informatics Institute, providing further evidence that it is Theo.Axel Rüger, the director of the Van Gogh Museum, said the discovery means “that we have rid ourselves of an illusion, while gaining a portrait of Theo”.He added: “We have essentially returned to the situation as it always was up to the mistaken identification in 1957, with a single photographic portrait of the young, 19-year-old Vincent van Gogh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97579d9dca0c3be2ee9136a266f35dd5c6abb098/0_187_2908_1744/master/2908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=530501484e330f0c3b1e1eb4e609f664","title":"amy lowell ted hughes and dh lawrence poet","story":"Paper claims Lowell’s earlier writings can be seen in Hughes’s poem Pike and Lawrence’s The Rainbow, but her gender and sexuality made her unpopularTed Hughes’s poem Pike is one of the late poet laureate’s best-known works, taught in schools across the UK and endlessly anthologised. But Hughes’s image of a fish with “green tigering the gold” has an unacknowledged debt to a forgotten poem by the American poet Amy Lowell, according to an English academic who claims that Hughes “confidently fished out the most appealing imagery from the earlier work” in a new paper.According to Dr Hannah Roche, a lecturer in English at the University of York, it is “nothing short of incredible” that Hughes’s 1959 poem Pike “has not been considered in its close relation” to Lowell’s 1914 work The Pike. In her paper Myths, Legends, and Apparitional Lesbians, which has just been published in the academic journal Modernist Cultures, Roche pinpoints similarities between the poems.“In Lowell’s poem, ‘shadows’, ‘green-and-copper’, ‘under the reeds’, and ‘orange’ appear in sequence in almost the same pattern, Hughes’s poem gives us ‘green tigering the gold’, ‘silhouette’ , ‘under the heat-struck lily pads’, and an ‘amber cavern’,” she writes, also highlighting the “echo” of Lowell’s line, “darkness and a gleam”, in the final line of Hughes’s poem: “Darkness beneath night’s darkness had freed”.“Readers would be forgiven for mistaking Lowell’s poem for a shorter draft of Pike, or for suggesting that Hughes confidently fished out the most appealing imagery from the earlier work,” writes Roche.She told the  that she felt it was an “unacknowledged debt”: “I don’t want to use the word plagiarism, I don’t want to make this bold claim, but I do think the influence is there … It’s not just a similar subject, it’s the imagery he used, it’s the language,” she said.“Here we see a celebrated male poet borrowing from a woman who was profoundly unpopular. She was a rather large lady, a lesbian, a woman, so for all these reasons she’s unpopular, uncelebrated, so it troubles me what Hughes has done. He didn’t acknowledge it and nobody has acknowledged it since.”A spokesperson for the Ted Hughes estate denied that Hughes owed a debt to Lowell, saying that Pike grew out of the poet’s childhood experiences when his family moved to south Yorkshire in 1938 and he began to fish for pike at night in a pond by the site of an ancient monastery.“It seems clear from Hughes’s own recollections here that his poem grew out of actual experience, and the estate’s view is that he owed no debt to Amy Lowell or her poem,” said the spokesperson.Lawrence, claims Roche’s paper, also “borrows” from Lowell, with the Sapphic bathing scenes in his novel The Rainbow drawing from Lowell’s poem In a Garden.“And the wavering, pallid figure was beside her, a hand grasping her arm. And the elder held the younger close against her, close, as they went down, and by the side of the water, she put her arms round her, and kissed her,” writes Lawrence. “And I wished for night and you.  I wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,  White and shining in the silver-flecked water.  While the moon rode over the garden,  High in the arch of night,  And the scent of lilacs was heavy with stillness.  Night, and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing,” writes Lowell.Roche believes that readers have been kept in the dark about Lowell’s contribution to modernist poetry. “Her poetry deserves a readership … She should definitely be read more widely, not just as a lesbian poet,” she said. “She deserves a readership outside the world of feminist scholarship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3926ce4c92f0e9b8a7e7ddd6732d73a51d4f8c3a/0_238_4138_2483/master/4138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb97af4f43d215e8d61cd6ee02d6acdd","title":"deutsche bank offices raided connection with panama papers","story":"Police search Frankfurt offices as part of investigation into alleged money launderingPolice in Germany have raided the offices of Deutsche Bank in connection with the Panama Papers revelations and as part of an investigation into alleged money laundering.About 170 police officers, prosecutors and tax inspectors searched six Deutsche Bank offices in and around Frankfurt, the public prosecutor’s office said. Investigators are looking into the activities of two Deutsche Bank employees who allegedly helped clients to set up offshore companies to launder money, it added.The Panama Papers, published by the  and a consortium of international journalists in April 2016, revealed how offshore tax havens including the British Virgin Islands were used to hide billions of dollars.The prosecutor’s office said it had seized written and electronic business documents. Police cars were parked outside the headquarters of the bank, Germany’s biggest lender.In a statement Deutsche Bank said it would “cooperate closely with prosecutors”, adding that it was “anxious to clarify all suspicions”. The bank said it believed it had previously handed over to the authorities all relevant information in the Panama Papers case.Records from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca were the basis of the Panama Papers investigation and included more than 10m documents. The revelations caused protests in several countries and led to the resignation of heads of state, including in Iceland and Pakistan.Deutsche Bank’s Geneva branch held accounts for two offshore companies belonging to the family of Pakistan’s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. The firms owned four luxury flats in Mayfair, which were at the centre of corruption charges against the Sharifs. In July Pakistan’s anti-graft court sentenced Sharif to 10 years in jail, and his daughter Maryam to seven years. The Sharif family denies wrongdoing and maintains that a Qatari prince gifted the property to Nawaz’s children to repay an old debt. In September Nawaz and Maryam were released pending an appeal.Anti-corruption groups welcomed the raid in Frankfurt and said it was a “nail in the coffin of the opaque offshore world”.“Almost three years on, and law enforcement are still relying on the Panama Papers for their work. It shows how investigative journalism has been at the forefront of opening the door on a morass of morally dubious – and sometimes illegal – activity by banks,” Ava Lee, a campaigner at Global Witness, said.She added: “How much more money needs to be siphoned into tax havens before we say enough is enough?”Deutsche Bank has been involved in the offshore world for decades. Fourteen German banks used the Panamanian law firm to set up more than 1,200 anonymous shell companies. By 2007 Deutsche Bank is said to have brokered or managed more than 400 of them. Several banks, including the Swedish lender Nordea, have already been fined by financial regulators for violating money laundering rules as a result of the Panama Papers.German prosecutors said they were looking at whether Deutsche Bank may have assisted clients to set up “offshore companies” in tax havens so that funds transferred to accounts at Deutsche Bank could skirt anti-money-laundering safeguards. Those allegedly involved were two bank employees – aged 50 and 46 – and others not yet identified.In 2016 alone, more than 900 customers were served by a Deutsche Bank subsidiary registered on the British Virgin Islands, generating €300m, prosecutors said.They said Deutsche Bank employees were alleged to have breached their duties by neglecting to report money laundering suspicions about clients and offshore companies involved in tax evasion schemes.The investigation is separate from another money laundering scandal surrounding the Danish lender Danske Bank, where Deutsche Bank is involved.Denmark’s state prosecutor filed preliminary charges on Wednesday against Danske for alleged violations of the country’s anti-money-laundering act in relation to its Estonian branch.Danske is under investigation for suspicious payments totalling €200bn from 2007 onwards and a source with direct knowledge of the case told Reuters that Deutsche Bank helped to process the bulk of the payments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f2c8a6aeee0800abccf0d7b1d523f5cb363072/0_0_1825_1095/master/1825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=683529b60423bfd6c57664a87ce67e3d","title":"brexit britain austerity","story":"“The polls called the referendum wrong” is a common misapprehension. In fact, while they were clearly wrong in the past two general elections, opinion polls were mostly right – at least within a margin of error – all the way through the 2016 referendum campaign. Although most commentators chose to interpret the polls through the prism of their own confirmation bias (what their friends thought would happen), and therefore assumed remain would walk it, the eventual close-run win for leave was fairly well predicted.Latest polling suggests that remain has improved its showing a little – although the net result is still “neck and neck”, too close to call. The problem with most polls, however, is not that they might be wrong but that they mask how polarised British voters’ views have become.Our work at BritainThinks identifies four Brexit tribes, not two, and shows that as much as two-thirds of opinion is clustered at the extremes. We identify the “diehards” who were delighted by the original referendum result, and have few significant concerns about leaving the European Union. At the opposite end of the spectrum sit the “devastated pessimists”, who were extremely disappointed by the result and can see no positives at all in leaving.However, voters are united in their view that Brexit is not going well – although this is driven more by impatience (“why hasn’t it happened already?”) than detailed analysis of the negotiations. Playing the focus‑group game of “If Brexit were an animal, what would it be?”, voters say it is the slowest animal they can think of: a sloth or a tortoise. They are also united – and doubly frustrated – that the Brexit process is distracting politicians from the issues that really matter, and feel far more tangible: the high cost of living, precarious employment, housing shortages, rising crime and, most of all, cuts, especially cuts to the NHS. Some worry out loud that “dragging out” the negotiations is an excuse to insure against these failures.Among the public, there is some anxiety about the prospect of “no deal” but little clarity about what it would mean. Most expect that the current deal (which they struggle to describe) will be rejected by parliament, and are even more concerned about what they assume will be more political turmoil, and continued stasis on the policy areas they regard as priority. They feel that they, the public, have been left out of the discussion, and this may explain a growing public appetite for a further referendum – although there is considerable concern about what the terms of the vote might be.Against the backdrop of ision, Brexit must be seen as a symptom not a cause. It has highlighted deep-rooted inequalities and differences in values that have existed for many years, and for this reason many “diehard” leave voters still believe that the long-term gains of leaving the EU will be worth any short-term pain. Although, as the prime minister has noticed, eight out of 10 say they want to see “the country come together”, it is hard to see how that can happen – wherever the Brexit negotiations and any subsequent votes take us – until those issues are addressed.• Deborah Mattinson is founder director of the research and strategy consultancy BritainThinks"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecfcae84ab9ac306de79ca100f2ee86d4f7ca03/0_45_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd9620eae70e6ae20989caa1840a0215","title":"new wave of democrats owe huge debt people power","story":"With just a few thousand votes between the two candidates for governor, election night during the US midterms in Wisconsin could not have been more tense. The slender lead kept flipping between Republican and Democrat as various precincts reported their results. Then shortly before midnight a local news presenter suggested, almost as an aside, that there could be about 40,000 more votes yet to be counted from the Democratic stronghold of Milwaukee. A week earlier, at a Republican event in nearby rural Kenosha, Milwaukee had been a punchline – an emblem of crime-ridden, multiracial, urban dysfunction. But they weren’t laughing now.When the numbers were crunched, the Republicans were done. After eight years of austerity, occupations, demonstrations and a failed attempt to recall conservative governor Scott Walker, who was twice re-elected, Democrats took back the governor’s mansion.In its margins the victory was narrow in its character it was immense. Out went the Koch-friendly, union bashing, Trump-embracing Republicans. In came a Democratic team with an entirely different trajectory. The governor-elect, Tony Evers, is a former teacher and school superintendent Mandela Barnes, a 31-year-old African American community organiser, will be his lieutenant governor Josh Kaul, a former prosecutor and voting rights activists, was elected attorney general and Sarah Godlewski, a veteran campaigner for fiscal accountability, will be the state treasurer. “These are not the traditional Capitol aides,” Nation magazine columnist and Wisconsin native John Nichols told me. “Gradually, they put together a new kind of politics.”There is an intimate connection between those years of protest and the nature of this election victory that has national significance in the US. It provides a lesson about the connection between movements and parties, elections and politics, that the Democrats would do well to learn before the new Congress sits in January.This was not a coincidence. Nor is it a story that ends with the election of these candidates. What follows is a new chapter in which we will see whether those who were elected are willing and able to deliver.The challenge is not a new one. There are many within the liberal establishment who struggle to understand politics beyond elections. If a political action is not geared, at least in part, to voting a certain way then they see limited, if any, value in it. “Simply being in a public place and voicing your opinion in and of itself doesn’t do anything politically,” said Congressman Barney Frank regarding the then-burgeoning Occupy Wall Street movement. That would be news to the suffragettes and movements for civil rights and trade unions, among others.When President John F Kennedy tried to persuade civil rights leaders to call off the March on Washington in 1963, where Martin Luther King made his “I have a dream” speech, he said it could damage important legislation he hoped to pass. “We want success in Congress,” he told them. “Not just a big show at the Capitol.” The African-American trade union leader A Philip Randolph warned him: “The Negroes are already in the streets. It is very likely impossible to get them off.” The march, and protests across the country, played a far bigger role in shaping the racial politics and civil rights legislation of the next few years than Kennedy’s bill ever could.The connection between those in the streets and those at the ballot box is not always immediate and causal. Often it is a question of framing, inspiration and articulation – movements create space for conversations that elected officials are often too wary to have. They address issues too urgent for a timetable geared not around the needs of people but the re-election of candidates. Disparaging as Frank was about Occupy Wall Street, the Barack Obama White House believed it had a significant effect on his re-election prospects.“I think it had a significant change in the overall climate in that it reframed the discussion nationally and it did two things,” Anita Dunn, White House communications director early in Obama’s presidency, told Dan Balz in his book Collision 2012. “One, it gave people permission to openly discuss something that had not really been openly discussed which was the growing inequalities and the unfairness. Two, it gave many members of the Democratic party much more confidence in going to those places in the criticism of the Republican policies.”Not only that, but “Democrats respond when they’re pushed,” as Jesse Sharkey, now the leader of the Chicago Teachers Union, told me after Barack Obama’s re-election in 2012. “They’re much more a weather vane than Republicans. If the wind’s blowing hard enough they’ll move.”There has been a gale afoot for some time now. The election of the most racially erse and most female Congress ever is clearly a product of a moment in which #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, Women’s Marches, Fight for 15, immigrant rights, gun control and climate change have emerged or continued to surge. The election of a misogynist bigot to the White House has doubtless been a catalyst for women and minorities to stand for election too.The Democratic party is an undeserving recipient of the energy and frustration generated over the past two years. It remains to be seen if it has the capacity and desire to become an adequate vessel for it. The fact remains that, electorally, it is also the only meaningful vessel available.Thanks to movement politics, those in power look different and come from more radical traditions. The question now – indeed the perennial question when it comes to issues of representation and ersity – is will they act differently and honour the traditions that made their election possible?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/672c74fb2c10402857cf43167f57b60fa050c6c8/0_0_4507_2704/master/4507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ddfe42555da27086d9b37da8a49cbf9","title":"the guardian view on theresa mays brexit campaign adapt or lose the vote","story":"At the start of this week, with her Brexit deal safely signed off in Brussels but with opposition to it consolidating in the House of Commons, Theresa May promised a campaign tour of Britain. She would use the tour, it appeared, to drum up support for her agreement, and to mobilise public opinion, which has swung towards her recently, to pressure MPs to back her in the vote on 11 December. It all sounded rather impressive – a prime minister getting on her soapbox, taking her message to the people, attempting to puncture the assumptions of the Westminster bubble.However, any thoughts that Mrs May would do a Gladstone – the Victorian Liberal leader stumped his constituency in 1879, giving a series of widely reported speeches that helped his party back to power – have been seriously disappointed. Mrs May has in fact made just three whistle-stop visits – to a showground in mid-Wales, a university in Belfast and a factory outside Glasgow. England outside London, where the bulk of the Brexit votes were cast in 2016, has not been on her itinerary. Now she is off to the G20 summit in Argentina. Next week she will be tied down in the five-day Commons debate on the Brexit deal. This isn’t taking the argument to the country. It’s a series of stunt visits squeezed in between other duties. The result is that Mrs May’s cavalry is still riding straight towards the enemy guns.Before she left for the G20, Mrs May spent nearly two hours answering questions at Westminster from the liaison committee of Commons committee chairs. The liaison committee contains some of her most obdurate Tory critics, like Bill Cash and Bernard Jenkin. But it also contains a range of senior backbenchers from across the spectrum of political reasonableness – like Sarah Wollaston, Yvette Cooper and Norman Lamb, all of whom sit for leave constituencies – and who might all in principle be opinion shapers with whom the prime minister could do business on Brexit.If that was the aim, the session was another missed opportunity. The committee asked many reasonable questions: on issues like ruling out a no-deal exit on contingency planning for a “Norway-plus” option on the shrinking of the UK economy following Brexit on the Northern Ireland border on how it was possible to vote on the deal without the publication of the government’s immigration strategy on the supply of medicines for the NHS and, almost poignantly, if she had learned any lessons from the negotiations.Mrs May offered not a chink of light on any of these subjects in any of her replies. Instead, she stayed rigidly on her own my-way-or-no-way script. The choice facing MPs was binary, she insisted, again and again. It was her deal or no deal. Nothing else could be contemplated or even discussed. Ludicrously, she refused to rule out leaving with no deal because to say that would be to admit that there might be other deal options available to MPs, like Norway-plus or a second referendum. Tragically, the only lesson she said she had learned was to be “rigorous and robust”.Yet this belief is Mrs May’s problem. Instead of thinking in advance about the compromise that might get through what is now a hung parliament, she charged off to Brussels insisting on unattainable red lines that would please only Tory ultras. Now she has emerged with a ragbag deal that most MPs still do not support. Instead of trying to build a majority for something better, she just repeats her mantras as if doing so can somehow make them come true. In this way, she makes her defeat more likely and the alternatives she refuses to countenance – a second vote, a softer deal or a crash-out – more probable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79335eadedfa17f422adab97c511deaa88070e09/0_0_941_572/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=765c884b2e44d3c3bab9914f930d23d1 685w","title":"suspended swansea university academic vehemently denies wrongdoing","story":"Head of management school lodges formal grievance as he is suspended alongside vice-chancellorA senior academic at Swansea University, who has been suspended alongside the vice-chancellor pending the outcome of an internal investigation, has denied any wrongdoing and has lodged a formal grievance against the registrar now in charge of the institution.Prof Marc Clement, dean of the school of management, instructed lawyers to launch the grievance against the registrar and chief operating officer, Andrew Rhodes, who earlier this week informed staff of the investigation and subsequent suspensions.Rhodes, an alumnus of Swansea who joined the university as registrar in April, was previously a senior civil servant working as director general of operations at the Department for Work and Pensions. In line with the university ordinances, the registrar is now acting vice-chancellor.A letter from Clement’s lawyers to members of Swansea University council, seen by the , said their client “vehemently” denied any wrongdoing, was “astounded” by his suspension and would do “all it takes to clear his good name and protect the institution to which he has dedicated a significant proportion of his professional life”. Attached to the letter was a notification of grievance.On Monday, staff and students at the university were informed that an internal investigation had been under way for the past few weeks and as a result the serving vice-chancellor, Prof Richard Davies, in post since 2003, had been suspended while it continued.Clement and two other members of staff from the school of management were also suspended – all on full pay. In a message to staff Rhodes gave no detail about what was being investigated, but said it did not concern the academic performance of the university or its financial wellbeing.The letter from Clement’s lawyers, Capital Law, said there had been no discussion of the allegations with their client prior to his suspension. “Had this occurred, he would have been able to allay the concerns raised. This would have avoided a very public suspension, the significant negative press interest and damage to the reputation of the university and of our client.”It went on: “The allegations appear to have been generated from incomplete, cursory and misleading due diligence. The upshot being that instead of now working for the furtherance of the university’s own interests, our client has been forced to take legal advice to protect his own position.“Our client wishes this matter be resolved as swiftly as possible, not only to limit the damage this may cause to the reputation of all parties involved but also to the vital work he is involved with within the university.”According to reports in Welsh media, members of Swansea University’s medical school have also written to council members expressing their support for both the vice-chancellor and Clement.“Both these men have worked tirelessly over many years to transform Swansea University,” the letter says.“Without them, there would be no school of medicine or the Bay campus. The public spectacle created beggars belief and to see these men treated in this manner brings grave concern for what our university is becoming.”A Swansea University spokesperson declined to make any comment relating to correspondence with council members. “However, we are satisfied that all procedures have been carried out robustly and correctly and in line with the university’s statutes and ordinances.”Under Davies’s leadership, Swansea University has made ambitious progress in recent years, opening a new £450m campus and climbing up the university rankings. It has also been involved in the £1.3bn Swansea Bay City Deal, signed off by Theresa May last year, to fund 11 projects in the area over the next 15 years, in particular a £200m state-of-the-art “wellness and life science village”, a huge regeneration project planned for Llanelli’s Delta Lakes area.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said it was “very unusual but not unprecedented” for a vice-chancellor to be suspended. Four years ago, the Plymouth vice-chancellor Prof Wendy Purcell was suspended pending a review.The Swansea vice-chancellor’s suspension came just weeks after Davies, who earns £252,000 a year, announced plans to retire at the end of the academic year. “This is not the time to reflect on the past,” he commented at the time.“There are more successes and exciting opportunities in the pipeline and, in the fast changing environment of higher education, including Brexit, 12 months is a long period. My focus will be on business as usual which includes, of course, helping to maintain the upward trajectory of the university.”According to Hillman, the climate in universities has changed in recent times, with vice-chancellors under increasing scrutiny from their governing bodies. “Governing bodies are a more important part of the picture than they used to be and have greater responsibilities – and they are beginning to flex their muscles a bit,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24254012d75fda815d40e093a6d4e2bf09e38af1/0_119_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8bf331c5c1310aa05c3abef6bb27bf","title":"china urged lead way efforts save life on earth un","story":"Delegates at UN bioersity conference turn to Beijing to avoid point of no returnChina must play a leading role if the world is to draw up a new and more effective strategy to halt the collapse of life on Earth, according to senior delegates at the close of this week’s UN bioersity conference.With the US absent, Europe distracted and Brazil tilting away from global cooperation, the onus has shifted towards Beijing, the diplomats said after two weeks of slow-moving talks on how to maintain the natural infrastructure on which humanity depends.China will host the next high-level negotiations, in 2020, which will be the most important in more than 10 years. This is the deadline for nations to agree on fresh global targets for the protection and management of forests, rivers, oceans, pollinators and other wildlife.Conservationists hope this “new deal for nature and people” becomes as much of a priority as the Paris climate accord and helps to reverse the current wave of extinction, which is at the highest rate the world has seen since the age of the dinosaurs.Over the coming two years, China should champion the cause of nature as France championed the cause of climate in the run-up to the Paris deal in 2016, urged the diplomats.“China is very important. It can be a great leader,” said Hesiquio Benítez Díaz, Mexico’s director general of international cooperation, who helped organise the previous global bioersity conference. “We’re reaching the point of no return for many species. It’s really bad, but people don’t see this issue.”Rather than leaving bioersity on the fringes, where it has until now been dealt with mostly by politically weak environment ministers and NGOs, he hoped Beijing would use its clout to ensure the subject was high on the agenda of G8 and G20 summits and to press for participation by heads of state in 2020. They also want the issue to be taken up by communities, companies and iniduals.This message was echoed by the executive secretary of the bioersity convention. “We tell China that the bioersity agenda needs a lot of championing,” said Cristiana Paşca Palmer. “They were instrumental in the success of Paris and they can play a very important role.”Until recently, China’s dire pollution problems and woeful record on wildlife conservation meant it would have been an unlikely champion of nature. However, under President Xi Jinping perceptions have started to shift. The government has promoted the concept of “ecological civilisation”, established hundreds of environmental courts and played a positive role in global climate talks.At the conference, Beijing sent mixed messages. It initially ignored a proposal to get involved in preparations with Mexico (the previous host) and Egypt (the host this year), and it remained low-key in Sharm el-Sheikh over the past two weeks of talks. “We were very nervous about their silence,” confided one foreign diplomat.But those familiar with the Chinese delegation said this reflected a difference of approach. Rather than set ambitious public goals, they said the country preferred to set expectations low and work at a higher level behind the scenes. “They are really determined to succeed, but they don’t know how to do it,” said another source.There was recognition that the current global management plan has been a failure: among the 20 Aichi bioersity targets, only one – on the creation of protected areas – is measurably close to being met. Highlighting the low priority that even the host government put on nature, a shop near the conference centre was openly selling an illegal lion hide for $1,500 (£1,170).This convention established a process to draw-up a “Post 2020 Road Map” with more forceful and effective goals. But the political winds are even less favourable than in 2010. Brazil, which played an important role eight years ago, will soon have a far-right government and its diplomats spent much of the time on niggling issues that could have an impact on exploitation of its world-leading bioersity. At one point the conference spent 35 minutes debating whether to be “concerned” or “deeply concerned” about the impact of climate change.A row broke out between developing and developed nations over how to share the economic benefits from genetic sequencing information. Tense negotiations were also needed to set new guidelines for gene drive technology, which can be used to eradicate entire species. Governments stopped short of imposing a moratorium, but built in strong precautions by insisting that no research be allowed without risk assessment , risk management and the consent of any communities who might be affected by the release of modified organisms.Crucially, the delegates struggled to identify what kind of target should be set. There was widespread agreement that bioersity needed a single measurable headline goal – equivalent to the 1.5-2C (34.7-35.6F) in climate negotiations. But there is, as yet, no single metric that can cover the complex interaction of life on Earth. Instead, discussions centred on setting either zero net loss of natural habitat or a broad goal to “bend the curve”, which means reverse bioersity loss worldwide through a series of bottom-up national commitments and wider demarcations of nature reserves, protected areas and traditional or indigenous community land.Pooven Moodley, the executive director of the NGO Natural Justice, said the conference had seen progress in terms of greater recognition of the need for improved environmental rights and more land tenure for indigenous groups. But he said overall the negotiations had failed to take into account the urgency of the crisis. “It does feel like rearranging the deckchairs as the Titanic sinks,” he said.Frustrations were also expressed by Ruth Davis, the deputy director of global programmes at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. “I am used to the UN – its ups and downs – but it’s still disorienting listening to hours of wrangling over single words in obscure documents in empty rooms when this is supposed – quite literally – to be about a plan to save life on Earth,” she tweeted.Despite occasional grumbles, delegates said the situation would be worse without the convention, which at least obliges governments to assess bioersity and report every four years (with the exception of the US, which is the only nation that does not take part). Protected areas – the one concrete target from 2010 – have expanded substantially in the past eight years. Conservation efforts have also helped to pull a few species including whales and mountain gorillas back from the brink of extinction.Pasça Palmer, the UN head of bioersity, said she too wanted more urgency, but she remained optimistic that a deal could be done in 2020. “The best possible outcome would be to have a clear recognition that bioersity is infrastructure affecting life and development. We have to govern in a holistic way, not just one species. And we need to make it clear in people’s minds that without it, we won’t have a healthy planet.”China will have its work cut out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f582b966cbc7335d64d31b8ae53cb1dca4cb47e0/98_0_3902_2342/master/3902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be55c163131ae45d086ebe288891ea6d","title":"roma review alfonso cuaron","story":"Alfonso Cuarón’s intimate family drama, set in 1970s Mexico, is a triumphant blend of tragedy, comedy and absurdity Alfonso Cuarón’s new film Roma is thrilling, engrossing, moving – and just entirely amazing, an adjectival pileup of wonder. He has reached back into his own childhood to create an intensely personal story, and this is the second time I have seen it since the premiere at this year’s Venice film festival, hoping to get a clearer view of those later images that on first viewing were made wobbly by tears. Same problem, though. Those coming to see this film had better prepare themselves to be emotionally wrung out.Cuarón has an extraordinary way of combining the closeup and the wide shot, the tellingly observed detail – humorous or poignant or just effortlessly authentic – with the big picture and the sense of scale. At times, it feels novelistic in its sense of character development and inner life: a densely realised, intimate drama developing in what feels like real time. In its engagingly episodic way, it is also like a soap opera or telenovela. And at other times it is resoundingly epic.The film is dynamically shot in a pellucid black and white, which has perhaps made it easier for the director (who is also the cinematographer) to use digital techniques for exterior shots, modifying and fabricating period details with an ecstatic, dreamlike certainty. The streetscapes in 1970s Mexico City are worthy of Scorsese, and Cuarón stages stunning crowd scenes, especially his evocation of the Corpus Christi massacre, when around 120 people were killed by the military during a student demonstration. Very often, Cuarón’s tracking shots slide and snake us through the crowds to the doors of a cinema, where in one scene an audience is shown enjoying John Sturges’s 1969 sci-fi picture Marooned, which we can now assume to be an influence on his own deep-space masterpiece, Gravity.Now, a note of reservation. This movie is produced by the streaming giant Netflix – yet far from being praised for having bankrolled a masterpiece, Netflix is widely attacked for intending this work to be consumed mostly on digital platforms, and permitting only a relatively small cinema release in exclusive partnership with one chain. It has effectively been accused of suppressing the big-screen identity of its own product.Well, it’s an old story. Many great films here only get a tiny cinema release, restricted to a couple of cities, and Roma is getting a wider showing than others in the past. Some of the accusers are behaving as if they have never deigned to watch a movie on TV or DVD in their lives. But there is a point here. Roma has to be seen on the big screen. Isn’t it possible for Netflix to widen the big-screen release in the UK and also Ireland for awards season and the New Year? Doesn’t the prospective box office bonanza attendant on its prizewinning success make this economically viable?Anyway, the year is 1970: posters for that summer’s World Cup, held in Mexico, are still seen in one child’s bedroom. The title refers to the city’s Colonia Roma district and to the director’s belief that Mexico City has been evolving in the four decades since into a non-imperial grandiosity, a quasi-Rome in its commotion and sprawl.Roma is fundamentally the tale of two women. One is Cleo (played wonderfully by non-professional newcomer Yalitza Aparicio), a young woman of Mixteco Mesomaerican heritage working as a live-in maid for a beleaguered upper-middle-class family in Mexico City. Cleo’s personal life is beginning to unravel in tandem with that of her employer, Sofía (Marina De Tavira).Cuarón shows how the household, though placid enough, is under pressure. There are signs of tension and dysfunction. The tiled courtyard driveway, which is shown being mopped clean over the opening credits, is habitually covered in the excrement of the family’s much cherished dog. The man of the house, Antonio (Fernando Grediaga), parks his car in this space with a wearied yet fanatical care that hints at his own unhappiness.His wife Sofía presides over four boisterous children, but the real work is being done by Cleo and her fellow maid Adela (Nancy García García), who are always eligible for the condescension of class and race but are nonetheless well treated. Antonio keeps going away for what are supposedly business trips and a stressed Sofía one day tells the children it would be a good idea to write to their dad, imploring him to come back. Meanwhile, Cleo has to explain to her dodgy, martial-arts enthusiast boyfriend Fermín (Jorge Antonio Guerrero) that she has missed her period. It is the prelude to disaster.There is tragedy, comedy and absurdity here, along with sublime mystery in its extraordinary setpieces. At the heart of it all is a wonderful performance from Aparicio, who brings to the role something delicate and stoic. She is the jewel of this outstanding film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a1d194a1f16ee6e792bebbd035be2a053686fb9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fb646cbb8d36e6e780e272e116ef939","title":"yuzu the citrus fruit that looks like it fell off a lorry","story":"It may not be the next avocado, but this hybrid of lime, lemon and grapefruit tastes nice, once you have got your head around itPity the food world.

It’s not exactly subtle, but juiced and mixed with other things, it certainly has the audacity to go mainstream.I first came across it in Nigel Slater’s 2013 book, Eat: The Little Book of Fast Food, with a sidenote saying it was available in specialist Japanese supermarkets five years later, it comes in four incarnations at Waitrose and as a seasoning at both Sainsbury’s and Tesco.Nobu (the fancy restaurant with all fish and no carbs), celebs and several outposts have been doing magical things with yuzu for ages. It is the (no longer) secret ingredient of Nobu’s footballer’s-wife classic, miso-marinated black cod, and now the restaurant has turned it into a one-bite tart as part of its affordable-for-Nobu festive afternoon tea (£30 with a glass of wine). It’s not the first place you think of come Christmas, but that doesn’t mean they don’t know how to do afternoon tea.The tart is a resounding success, the yuzu custard all zingy and bouncy, and barely set in its case, overshadowing the rest of what is a great tea party, served on china with black tea and snow crab tempura sandwiches. The whole shebang is joyous – each macaroon and cake is shaped into something seasonal such as a tree or a reindeer, which clash comically with the otherwise serious interiors of the restaurant.If you want the full yuzu experience, my advice is to treat it like you would a lemonlimegrapefruit and eat it in something sweet, ideally somewhere Japanese. I tried almost everything yuzu-based I could for the purposes of this column. If you can track it down, Sansu’s yuzu and salty lychee drink manages to not be disgusting, while a small bottle of yuzu juice from Waitrose peps up a green-salad dressing. Despite some heavy Googling, yuzu peel, an Asian staple, eluded me. This is a shame – one of its main uses is added to a bath as a relaxant, presumably for when you have overdone the yuzu.

All the while still choosing to enter Klopp’s narrative of distraction in defeat – but only by pointing out that it was, in fact, a narrative of distraction in defeat.Heavy metal passive-aggressive post-modern press conferences. Pull up a chair, media studies students. And all this just to drive some straightforward headlines about a 2-1 loss that owed a lot to Paris Saint-Germain’s craft and intensity, but which also flagged up the snags in Liverpool’s midfield that will be a concern for this evolving team.No doubt Klopp will continue to ponder this in those hours when he is not sitting in front of a piece of cardboard covered in adverts. But there is an issue here, and a point of confusion between method and personnel on nights such as these.Liverpool began with the same flat, muscular Milner-Henderson-Wijnaldum axis that has now started all three away defeats in Europe. It is a midfield that looks perfect for last season’s system, the high-pressing, hard-running game that creates chances out of orderly disorder.Faced with a midfield of greater ball-playing craft, they instead sat deeper and went toe-to-toe in the finer arts, looking at times like a man trying to conduct a concert orchestra with a policeman’s baton. Sometimes you really are better off just hitting someone over the head with it.“Un Victoire Capitale! PSG s’impose sur Liverpool” was the headline in one Paris daily on Thursday morning . And for all the distracting noises about gamesmanship, PSG did impose themselves in that period when the game was won, Verratti, Neymar, Marquinhos and Ángel Di María dominating the ball and playing in a system that flattered their own best attributes.Successful teams are sometimes compared to a fine wine, something that becomes more nuanced with age. This Klopp-era Liverpool have gone further, changing from a bottle of something fizzy and fun and likely to leave you with an exhilarating headache the next day into a thicker, more restrained vintage, lacking a little in the high notes.This is, of course, part of the plan. Klopp has spoken at length about his efforts to create a team that can win by scoring just once rather than playing always in the eye of the hurricane. It may work out. The season is long and attritional.But there is also the danger that a midfield of workers and runners makes sense when your full-backs and front three are tearing around creating potent havoc but less so when there is a requirement to make chances in a more patient, structured fashion. There is also no doubt that they have missed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s dynamism, his more vertical movements with the ball. Philippe Coutinho’s skill and vision in those areas has not been replaced. Naby Keïta will presumably settle. Fabinho seems an unnecessary layer of additional muscle.At the end of which £90m has been spent on re-gearing the midfield for this more measured Klopp team, but it still looks more suited to scrapping and covering behind the old tearaway attack. And yes, quite a lot of this comes back to Jordan Henderson, who played as he always does in Paris: wholeheartedly, retaining his intensity to the last, but fraught with the same limitations.Henderson is a strange player in many ways. He has played 260 games now, been a fixture in the two best Liverpool teams of the last 13 years and been picked and prized by Klopp, Brendan Rodgers, Kenny Dalglish, Gareth Southgate, Roy Hodgson and Fabio Capello. For all that, he remains a player whose qualities are more obvious to those who watch the team from the inside than to those who see just the outline details of match day.Clearly those managers will also see Henderson’s technical limitations. This is a midfielder with one goal in his last 97 games, despite spending a fair amount of each game around the opposition goal. He seems physically unable to turn with the ball in a tight space, meaning every time he takes it with his back to goal he passes backwards, a powerful contrast with most high-class central midfielders, for whom it is an essential skill to take the ball and turn in one movement.In Paris Henderson was bypassed repeatedly in the first half by Neymar, the last with a dismissive veering run that just said, yes, I can move that bit quicker than you.To Henderson’s credit he kept going right to the end, dragging his team along with him, influence growing as time ticked down. But it is not hard to see why Klopp would rather turn the discussion to PSG’s players falling over a lot (which they did) than linger on an unbalanced midfield that seems caught between stick or twist, dogs of the high-press asked to perform a more mannered role against opponents better tailored to the task.Liverpool could still have emerged with a draw. Sadio Mané dropped deep to good effect and bridged the midfield creativity gap at times. Andrew Robertson was fearless as ever. And in mitigation of the midfield effort, Roberto Firmino’s poor form hardly helps. That ability to drop back, hook the ball out of the air, capoeira-style, and find players around him on the turn is a powerful creative weapon. Right now he just looks a little low on zip.There are some positives in defeat. In a way the result simplifies the final act against Napoli two weeks from now. Liverpool will have to win 1–0, or handsomely. This is surely the moment for a tactical reboot of last season’s blitz football, a game to play with fire not ice in the head and in a style that might just leave the midfield looking a little happier in its own clothes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14326e9eab36b01fb158cbdc137b4bc3d3cb3229/194_75_2624_1574/master/2624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8519ac46c5fe02387a13f3ef04d9a50","title":"vorskla poltava arsenal europa league match report","story":"Arsenal won their in their Europa League group as a much-changed side coasted to a 3-0 victory against Vorskla in sub-zero Kiev.The fixture had been moved 185 miles west of Poltava to the capital’s Olympic stadium, with parts of Ukraine under martial law as political tensions with Russia continue to rise.The decision to relocate the game was made on Tuesday evening, with Vorskla particularly unhappy with Uefa’s decision and official confirmation that the match would take place at all not coming from the governing body until six hours before kick-off.Any inconvenience for Unai Emery and his players did not show as the youngsters Emile Smith Rowe and Joe Willock scored either side of an Aaron Ramsey penalty to confirm a win in temperatures that dropped to minus 10C.The last English side to play in the stadium had been Liverpool when they lost last season’s Champions League final to Real Madrid but this contest – watched by a minimal crowd – was never going to live up to such an occasion.Arsenal handed a first start to the teenage striker Eddie Nketiah as Emery made 10 changes, with only Rob Holding retaining his place from Sunday’s  win at Bournemouth.Willock, an academy graduate, was also given a rare chance to impress and Ainsley Maitland-Niles started for the first time since the opening day of the season, while Petr Cech returned in goal to captain the Gunners.It was Vorskla who crafted the first half-chance of the evening, Iurli Kolomoets firing over from an acute angle after latching on to a free-kick before Cech fumbled a long-range effort from Volodymyr Chesnakov as the nominal home side started brightly.That early work was undone as Smith Rowe handed Arsenal a 10th-minute lead, turning the ball home at the back post after smart work from Ramsey and Nketiah.

In other news, here’s an exclusive from Daniel Taylor about a complaint made against the PFA’s Gordon Taylor. Chelsea substitution: Morata on, Giroud off. That should be to preserve him for a start at the weekend. 72 min: PAOK continue to play with gumption. They’ve done well not to sink here. And Sarri will probably be miffed that his team haven’t scored more.70 min: Christensen is receiving treatment on the pitch for an injury he received while jumping for an aerial duel. 68 min: Loftus-Cheek tumbles at the edge of the area after beating one defender. The crowd roar for a penalty but the ref correctly saw that Loftus-Cheek lost his footing on his own.66 min: Ampadu is playing at right-back and is putting himself about well, making a couple of important tackles already. Chelsea substitution: Ampadu on, Zappacosta off. It’s the Welsh international’s first appearance for his club this season, following some outstanding displays for his country.The 18-year-old scores his first goal for Chelsea and it’s a lovely one! He picked up the ball at the left-hand corner of the box, shuffled forward and sized up a defender before fooling the keeper by sidefooting a low shot in at the near post.60 min: Fabregas pings another fine ball to Pedro, who turns on to his left foot and opens fire from the corner of the box. It’s deflected behind for a corner. 58 min: After a corner is punched away by the keeper. Zappacosta collects the ball and tries to lash it into the net from nearly 30 yards. It’s a cracking effort and whizzes only inches over the bar! 57 min: Paschalaki makes another decent save to deny Loftus-Cheek.55 min: Warda has made a big difference since his introduction at half-time. He’s a skilled and perky runner and he wants to do Chelsea damage. Many teams would have folded at two goals and one man down but PAOK are showing great spirit.54 min: Cahill deservedly booked for cynically taking out El Kaddouri as PAOK launched a counter-attack. The foul was just inside the Chelsea half but it aborted a dangerous attack - that’s why I’ve long maintained such fouls should be punished by a penalty, no matter where they take place.52 min: PAOK threaten with a break down the right. It’s crossed low to Warda, who takes a touch and then goes down in the box - Emerson poked the ball off his foot and then caught him. He demands a penalty but will have to settle for a corner. 50 min: PAOK have defended well near their box. Other than the mistake that led to the early red card, Chelsea have had to play sharply to forge openings.47 min: Hudson-Odoi continues to look lively. The teenager certainly isn’t shy about showing his talent - he runs at defenders at every opportunity. But he’s no mere trickster - he’s got poise and smarts too and tends to pick out the right ball at the end of his dribbles. PAOK Substitution: Warda on, Prijovic off. That’s a forward for a forward so let’s see how much difference it makes.“You’re right that Chelsea’s record score was 13-0, I was there,” reveals Ron Sidewater. “The opposition had one player in glasses and another with one arm.” That is quite right. Guy Thill was the striker born with one arm. Two of his teammates that day were over the age of 40. In fairness, they kept Chelsea’s to 8-0 in the leg in Luxembourg. Chelsea were on top even before PAOK were reduced to 10 men in the seventh minute, and since then it has been almost total dominance. Giroud has scored two nice goals and Chelsea look in the mood to go for many more. Hudson-Odoi has been perky on his debut, Fabregas has run midfield, Loftus-Cheek has shown some beautiful touches, Pedro and Zappacosta have made constant gains down the right, and Giroud has demonstrated that he is the best striker at Chelsea.42 min: Jaba shows that PAOK are not totally impotent. He makes a nice run towards the edge of the Chelsea area and then unloads a powerful shot. But Cahill slides in to block it well.40 min: Pedro miskicks in front of goal after top work by Emmerson “Hey Paul, what is Chelsea’s record win in Europe? Will the beat it tonight?” hollers Andrew Gilmour. Their record win is 13-0 v Jeunesse Hautcharage in the 1972 Cup Winners’ Cup. And yes, there is no doubt they will beat that tonight. Honest! Another dainty pass from Fabregas yields another fine finish from Giroud! The From a central position midway inside the PAOK half, Fabregas dropped the ball over the top of the defence and into the path of Giroud, who volleyed with his left foot into the net from a tight angle about seven yards out. 36 min: Zappacosta attacks down the right again. HE turns inside on to his left foot and had a pop from distance. It’s wobbles several yards wide. 33 min: Pedro slips in the underlapping Zappacosta, whose shot from a tight angle is saved by the keeper. 32 min: What an odd experience this must be for PAOK. As unbeaten leaders of their league, they can’t have had much practice had being totally dominated and down to 10 men. This is a wonderful learning opportunity for them, then. And, in fairness, there’s no trace of despondency from them.30 min: Paschalakis does well to bat a Pedro cross away from the danger zone. But you know Chelsea will be back putting him under pressure any second now ...28 min: Hudson-Odoi nearly doubles Chelsea’s lead immediately. He picks up a loose ball and curls it against the crossbar from 20 yards! That was inevitable. And when it came it was well constructed and finished. Fabregas aimed another fine long pass to Pedro, who controlled it superbly and teed up Giroud. The striker curled a low shot past the keeper and into the corner from 15 yards. 26 min: Zappacosta flights in a good cross from the right. Giroud nods it wide. After fouling the defender an’ all. 25 min: Loftus-Cheek produces another flourish of class with a sumptuous chipped pass to Hudson-Odoi, whose cross is deflected out for a corner.24 min: Lovely intricate run by Loftus-Cheek near the byline. With tremendous nimbleness he weaved between two in a tight space and tried to poke over a cross. It was blocked.23 min: Fine defending at the back post by Vierinha, who outjumped Cahill to head clear after a dangerous cross by Emerson.22 min: Fabregas is in his element. He’s got the time and space to spray the ball wherever he pleases. In such circumstances, he remains a top-class player. 20 min: Loftus-Cheek lets fly with a fizzing shot from 25 yards. The keeper plunges to his left to tip it out for a corner. That shot was struck beautifully and the save was a match for it. 18 min: PAOK, to their credit, are showing real attacking intent when they actually get the ball. Chelsea had to charge down a pair of long-range shots just now after a zippy move.16 min: Strong work by Loftus-Cheek in his own half leads to Zappacosta drilling in a cross from the right. It’s put behind for a corner. PAOK are clinging on...14 min: Fabregas feeds Hudson-Odoi at the left-hand side of the box. The youngster tries to wrap his foot around a shot into the bottom corner but he doesn’t get enough curl on it. 12 min: Matos coolly chests the ball back to his keeper from five yards as Chelsea players lurked for a tap-in.11 min: A raking long pass from deep by Fabregas is taken down deftly by Pedro, whose next touch isn’t so good. And his third skies the ball over the bar from 16 yards. 10 min: Hudson-Odoi lifts another nice pass over the top for Giroud to run on to. He hits the bouncing ball on the run from a difficult angle but sends it over the bar. 8 min: Fabregas fires a low freekick under the wall and a couple of yards wide.7 min: A loose backpass puts Khacheridi in trouble, as Giroud beats him to it. The defender makes a desperate tackle at the edge of the box and misses the pull and pulls down the striker. The ref has no hesitation in showing a red card. 6 min: Hudson-Odoi dinks in a lovely cross from the right towards Giroud. But the Frenchman, under pressure from a defender, can’t reach it. 5 min: PAOK make a break for the first time and win a freekick, as Pedro knocks over Shakohov. The freekick from the left causes a little bit of ballyhoo in the home box but they eventually whack it clear.3 min: Pedro’s has a bang from long range. It’s deflected out for a corner. That’s overhit.2 min: The game’s been played to a non-stop soundtrack of whistles so far, as PAOK fans try to put Chelsea off. To no avail, as yet, because the hosts have hogged the ball.1 min: We have kickoff! Chelsea do the necessary and launch it immediately towards Hudson-Odoi on the left. But really it was a kick for territory and they’ve won a throw-in in line with the 18-yard mark.The teams amble out on to the pitch. Chelsea are all in blue, PAOK all in orange. There are some 3,000 visiting fans at Stamford Bridge and they’re making a pleasing din.The other game in this group kicked off earlier and has just finished. BATE Borisov beat Vidi 2-0. That means that Chelsea have already won the group, which rather lowers the stakes for the forthcoming match for the hosts. All they’ve to do now is impress Sarri and hope they force their way into the first team. Kanté won’t get the chance, though, because he’s not in the squad. Not good enough for the Europa League? Nah, he’s probably being saved for a role that doesn’t suit him against Fulham on Sunday. It’s only a matter of time before (a) he is genuinely dropped or (b) Sarri modifies his plans.Sarri has changed all 10 outfield players from the defeat to Spurs. The newcomers include 18-year Hudson-Odoi, an exciting winger given his first start of the season. Hello. The bad news for PAOK Salnika is that this match means something to Chelsea. Even though the Londoners have already qualified for the last 32 of this competition, having won all four of their matches to date, they are eager to go through as group winners – and, most of all, Maurizio Sarri had demanded to see a reaction to their first defeat of the season, which came as a result of last weekend’s dishevelled performance against Spurs. So though the Greeks need a win to stay alive in this competition, Chelsea will be bearing no gifts.But nor will PAOK make things easy for Chelsea, who edged to a 1-0 win when the teams met earlier in the competition. Runaway leaders of the Greek league, PAOK have performed better away than at home in Europe this season. They drew at Basel and Spartak Moscow before being eliminated from the Champions League before the group stages and their only win so far in this competition was a 4-1 triumph at Bate Borisov. They could conceivably punish another outbreak of slackness by the home team.

It’s been invigorating. Bye!Here’s the Press Association’s hot take on the Arsenal game:Arsenal secured top spot in their Europa League group as a much-changed side coasted to a 3-0 Europa League victory against Vorskla Poltava in sub-zero Kiev.The call to relocate the game was made on Tuesday evening, with Vorskla particularly unhappy with Uefa’s decision and official confirmation that the match would take place at all not coming from the governing body until six hours before kick-off.Any inconvenience for Unai Emery and his players did not show as youngsters Emile Smith Rowe and Joe Willock scored either side of an Aaron Ramsey penalty to confirm a win in temperatures that dropped as low as minus 10 degrees. The last English side to play in the Olympic Stadium were Liverpool as they lost last season’s Champions League final to Real Madrid but this contest - watched by a minimal crowd - was never going to live up to such an occasion. Arsenal handed a first start to teenage striker Eddie Nketiah as Emery made 10 changes, with only Rob Holding retaining his place from Sunday’s Premier League win at Bournemouth. Academy graduate Willock was also given a rare chance to impress as Ainsley Maitland-Niles started for the first time since the opening day of the season, while Petr Cech returned in goal to captain the Gunners. It was Vorskla who crafted the first half-chance of the evening, Iurli Kolomoets firing over from an acute angle after latching onto a free-kick before Cech fumbled a long-range effort from Volodymyr Chesnakov as the nominal home side started brightly. That early work was undone as Smith Rowe handed Arsenal an 11th-minute lead, turning home at the back-post after smart work from both Ramsey and Nketiah. Ramsey doubled the advantage shortly before the half-hour mark as he won and converted a penalty - the Wales international going down after minimal contact from Vorskla defender Igor Perduta before coolly converting the spot-kick. The points, and first place in the group, were sealed when Willock tucked home his first senior goal after latching onto Mohamed Elneny’s pass. Nketiah drew a save out of Bohdan Shust at the start of the second half, with Smith Rowe seeing a second of the night eventually ruled out for offside after he turned home Stephan Lichtsteiner’s deflected cross. Emery used the opportunity to blood more academy talent as Zech Medley, Bukayo Sako and Charlie Gilmour were introduced from the bench on a night where Arsenal got the job done despite all the uncertainty over the game. Topping the group ensures the Gunners will be seeded for the round-of-32 draw and will face a runner-up from another Europa League group or one of the four sides with the worst records who drop down from the Champions League. This match is over but the night is still young, and Paul Doyle is all over Chelsea v PAOK:So Arsenal and Sporting both qualify from Group E, and given Arsenal’s better head-to-head record against the Portuguese they will win the group and can play as many promising teenagers as they like when they host Qarabag in their final game in a fortnight.Talking of wildly one-sided matches, Sporting have won 6-1 at Qarabag.90+4 mins: And that’s it! Arsenal were red hot in the ice cold, and cantered to victory in a wildly one-sided match.90+3 mins: Now Vorskla attack, and the ball is passed to Careca, in a bit too much space 20 yards from goal, but his shot curls well wide.90+2 mins: Good late high pressing from Arsenal eventually wins the ball back, and Elneny passes to Nketiah who gets into the area, spins and sends a left-foot shot across goal and wide.90+1 mins: There will be some four minutes of stoppage time, and they start with an Arsenal corner.90 mins: Another Arsenal chance: Saka passes to Willock, who sees the goalkeeper advancing and shoots straight into him rather than lifting it over the top.89 mins: Arsenal’s lead on shots is only 12-11, but the majority of Vorskla’s have been from distance, and absolutely dire. They have only had two shots on target.86 mins: The physio is on, with Willock a bit ball-dazed.85 mins: Nketiah weaves his way to the byline on the right and blasts the ball across goal. Perduta tries to clear, but blasts the ball into the face of the onrushing Willock, and it bounces wide.81 mins: Chesnakov has a wild shot from range. In fact the ball hit Jenkinson in the arm rather than the face, but his arm was covering his chest and there was no arm-to-ball movement, so the penalty appeals were rebuffed.80 mins: Vorskla somehow fail to convert an excellent position into a shot on target, with Careca getting the ball stuck between his feet and when it breaks to a team-mate, the shot hits Jenkinson in the face.79 mins: It would be fair to say that this game is lacking somewhat in competitive edge.77 mins: Nketiah bursts down the left, leaves the defence eating dust and then messes up his pass inside and Vorskla clear.77 mins: Arsenal’s final change sees them bring Gilmour on for Guendouzi. 75 mins: Cech though is having his busiest spell of the match. This time he races from his area to clear a through-ball.74 mins: Shust is in action again, this time saving from Saka, who controls nicely, shuffles the ball away from his feet and then shoots at the near post.72 mins: Kolomoets is booked for tripping Maitland-Niles.71 mins: Chances for both teams, and saves from both keepers! Perduta has a great chance for Vorskla but Cech comes out to get his body in the way, and then Arsenal run down the other end and Smith-Rowe has an effort beaten away.70 mins: Bad news for upset fans: Milan, who were 2-1 down at home to Luxembourg no-hopers Dudelange with half an hour to play, have come back to lead 3-2.68 mins: A second Arsenal substitution sees Ramsey trudge off, and Saka come on.67 mins: GOAL! No, disallowed! Lichtsteiner crosses from the right, Chesnakov leaves it for Dallku, Dallku leaves it for Chesnakov, and in the end it bounces unmolested through to Smith-Rowe, who converts at the far post. Nketiah though was offside in the middle, and being marked by one of those two, and so it’s chalked off.64 mins: The referee has just had to exchange his free-kick-assisting pitch-marking spray for one that hasn’t frozen solid. This is not a good sign.63 mins: Arsenal work Guendouzi into a decent crossing position on the right, but his cross is wildly overhit, and also curls out of play on its way across and out for a throw-in.60 mins: Zech Medley comes on, making his Arsenal debut in place of Holding.59 mins: Another Vorskla shot flies well high of goal, though Artur’s 35-yarder was also well wide.55 mins: Dallku hits a dipping volley from 23 yards, and it would have been an absolute beauty had the goal been another five yards taller.54 mins: Holding is booked for using his arms when jumping for a header when there were lots of green shirts around.53 mins: Chance! Willock steals the ball from Artur and plays in Nketiah, whose finish is very weak when he really should have scored.52 mins: Nketiah runs between two defenders, who pretty much usher him through, but Ramsey is a couple of inches offside when the pass comes.50 mins: Arsenal look a fine, confident team now. It took a goal or two for the level of their superiority to manifest itself, but it’s now pretty glaring*.* I apologise in advance for the inevitable Vorskla comeback.47 mins: Arsenal win a corner, which Holding reaches first and flicks over the bar.The players are back out! In other news, Micheal Jacob emails to tell me that Danny John-Jules is Tyreece’s uncle.“A bit of showbiz trivia for you,” writes Matt Emerson. “Tyreece John-Jules (Arsenal sub tonight) is the son of Danny John-Jules, once of Red Dwarf and recently on Strictly.”This does appear to be true:A thoroughly satisfactory half for the away side, who now have 15 minutes of centrally-heated comfort in which to bask in the virtual warmth of a comfortable lead.45+1 mins: There will only be one minute of stoppage time, unless something exciting happens.45 mins: Elneny gives the ball away this time, hitting it straight into Kulach who then runs away and, from 25 yards and with just empty grass between him and Petr Cech, wildly miscues a shot into the stands.Elneny intercepts the ball in midfield and passes swiftly to Willock, who approaches the area and, with Dallku backing off, curls it deliciously inside the far post!40 mins: Chesnakov manages to trip Maitland-Niles and Ramsey with the same action on the half-way line, a quite spectacular achievement.

I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b79559668f7ad136d222dcd36c15c0b30ec3d6f/0_0_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efee944098ff5f2ca24a81b6ca7be6a6","title":"fir crying out loud share your photos of the worst christmas trees","story":"After the White House caused seasonal smirks with its latest offering, we want to see more seasonal decoration failsLike it or not, Black Friday has come and gone and with December approaching, Christmas is on the horizon.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

This packed performance in a suitably devotional space – an active church meets gig venue in north London – is testing the waters to see if their devotional music could work for secular audiences.They might be preaching to the converted in this show, but a canny programme of gospel-style pop songs has distinct crossover appeal. Some of their material is explicitly inspired by gospel (Beyoncé’s Halo, Jill Scott’s Golden, the Isley Brothers’ Harvest for the World, the Aretha Franklin medley) other songs are secular gospel anthems (Bob Dylan’s Make You Feel My Love or John Legend’s All of Me). The most effective cover versions completely transform the originals – an arrangement of Coldplay’s Fix You is packed with audacious chord changes that Chris Martin couldn’t have dreamed of, while the devotional core of Stormzy’s Blinded By Your Grace is amplified impressively.The 20 or so singers of the choir are backed by piano, bass, guitar and drums (and, rather cheekily on several tracks, some prerecorded strings), but the power really comes when the choir does the heavy lifting. For the few godless folks in this packed crowd, it is those full-throated, ecstatic harmonies on belters such as Let It Shine that really get the spine tingling and convey a sense of the numinous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59ccd17f1aee2276cdae4e39680776de50bc206a/191_0_3955_2373/master/3955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18a8df96c4189259d1c7c70b9a560f33","title":"un adds reggae music to list of international cultural treasures","story":"Jamaica’s distinctive beat has furthered ‘international discourse on injustice’, says Unesco – while devotees praise it for breaking down colonial race barriersThe UN has added reggae music to its list of international cultural treasures worthy of protection and promotion.Jamaica applied for recognition of its musical tradition at a meeting of the UN in Mauritius this year. “It is a music that we have created that has penetrated all corners of the world,” said the country’s culture minister Olivia Grange.BBC Radio 1Xtra presenter Dave Rodigan said: “The Unesco announcement is fantastic news for reggae, which has traditionally spoken out for the underprivileged whilst offering hope for a world in which love and respect is paramount.”The function of the music “as a vehicle for social commentary, a cathartic practice and a means for praising God” had not changed since its emergence from the Caribbean in the late 1960s, said Unesco.Reggae artist Hollie Cook said that politicians could take a leaf out of reggae’s “strong message of peace, love and unity”, and described its cultural impact as “a great example of how immigration has a great and positive effect in our society. Maybe some of our country’s leaders can put down their pens, stop fear-mongering and blast out some Aswad to relax.”Postwar immigration from Jamaica led to the genre flourishing in the UK: this year, the famed British reggae label Trojan celebrated its 50th anniversary. Laurence Cane-Honeysett, author of The Trojan Records Story, described the UN’s recognition as an “amazingly positive” move. “The impact and influence of the genre globally has long been overlooked.“It has contributed significantly to the development of multiculturalism, with the ska, rock steady and reggae of the 1960s and early 70s having a notably positive effect in the breaking down of social barriers by bringing together people of all colours, particularly in Britain.”BBC Radio 6 Music presenter Don Letts told the  of reggae’s enduring significance: “If you look at a map of the world, Jamaica’s a tiny island that spent hundreds of years under colonial rule. Ironically, in the 21st century, it has culturally colonised the planet.“The island’s culture as typified by its art, language, dance and attitude continues to capture the imagination of people globally. The sonic experiments created in Jamaican studios are now part of the fabric of contemporary music. Jamaica is a testament to the power of culture to act as a tool for social change, albeit at a grassroots level.”Letts said that reggae “can take care of itself”, but added: “There’s no doubt that Jamaica’s not reaped the financial rewards of its cultural impact, and that’s what the island really needs. If the UN can sort that, go for it.”Unesco’s  list began in 2008, following an international convention to safeguard intangible cultural heritage. It defines this as “the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, iniduals recognise as part of their cultural heritage”.The purposes of the convention are to safeguard, ensure respect, raise awareness and provide for international cooperation and assistance. Other traditions inscribed to this year’s list include the art of dry stone walling, Slovenian bobbin lacemaking, Georgian chidaoba wrestling, the Irish sport of hurling, Poland’s szopka nativity scene tradition and the traditional spring festive rites of Kazakh horse breeders.It is distinct from the world heritage list, which designates important physical sites including the Giza pyramids and the Cornish mining landscape."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a2334ee28cec1c7e318bf18b8f59b16278933d4/235_104_3554_2133/master/3554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc572d01831c5bf3e03b0d93269d4f93","title":"why we stopped trusting elites the new populism","story":"The credibility of establishment figures has been demolished by technological change and political upheavals. But it’s too late to turn back the clock. By  William DaviesMore from this series: The new populismFor hundreds of years, modern societies have depended on something that is so ubiquitous, so ordinary, that we scarcely ever stop to notice it: trust. The fact that millions of people are able to believe the same things about reality is a remarkable achievement, but one that is more fragile than is often recognised.At times when public institutions – including the media, government departments and professions – command widespread trust, we rarely question how they achieve this. And yet at the heart of successful liberal democracies lies a remarkable collective leap of faith: that when public officials, reporters, experts and politicians share a piece of information, they are presumed to be doing so in an honest fashion.The notion that public figures and professionals are basically trustworthy has been integral to the health of representative democracies. After all, the very core of liberal democracy is the idea that a small group of people – politicians – can represent millions of others. If this system is to work, there must be a basic modicum of trust that the small group will act on behalf of the much larger one, at least some of the time. As the past decade has made clear, nothing turns voters against liberalism more rapidly than the appearance of corruption: the suspicion, valid or otherwise, that politicians are exploiting their power for their own private interest.Much of the time, the edifice that we refer to as “truth” is really an investment of trust. Consider how we come to know the facts about climate change: scientists carefully collect and analyse data, before drafting a paper for anonymous review by other scientists, who assume that the data is authentic. If published, the findings are shared with journalists in press releases, drafted by university press offices. We expect that these findings are then reported honestly and without distortion by broadcasters and newspapers. Civil servants draft ministerial speeches that respond to these facts, including details on what the government has achieved to date.A modern liberal society is a complex web of trust relations, held together by reports, accounts, records and testimonies. Such systems have always faced political risks and threats. The template of modern expertise can be traced back to the second half of the 17th century, when scientists and merchants first established techniques for recording and sharing facts and figures. These were soon adopted by governments, for purposes of tax collection and rudimentary public finance. But from the start, strict codes of conduct had to be established to ensure that officials and experts were not seeking personal gain or glory (for instance through exaggerating their scientific discoveries), and were bound by strict norms of honesty.But regardless of how honest parties may be in their dealings with one another, the cultural homogeneity and social intimacy of these gentlemanly networks and clubs has always been grounds for suspicion. Right back to the mid-17th century, the bodies tasked with handling public knowledge have always privileged white male graduates, living in global cities and university towns. This does not discredit the knowledge they produce – but where things get trickier is when that homogeneity starts to appear to be a political identity, with a shared set of political goals. This is what is implied by the concept of “elites”: that purportedly separate domains of power – media, business, politics, law, academia – are acting in unison.A further threat comes from iniduals taking advantage of their authority for personal gain. Systems that rely on trust are always open to abuse by those seeking to exploit them. It is a key feature of modern administrations that they use written documents to verify things – but there will always be scope for records to be manipulated, suppressed or fabricated. There is no escaping that possibility altogether. This applies to many fields: at a certain point, the willingness to trust that a newspaper is honestly reporting what a police officer claims to have been told by a credible witness, for example, relies on a leap of faith.A trend of declining trust has been underway across the western world for many years, even decades, as copious survey evidence attests. Trust, and its absence, became a preoccupation for policymakers and business leaders during the 1990s and early 2000s. They feared that shrinking trust led to higher rates of crime and less cohesive communities, producing costs that would be picked up by the state.What nobody foresaw was that, when trust sinks beneath a certain point, many people may come to view the entire spectacle of politics and public life as a sham. This happens not because trust in general declines, but because key public figures – notably politicians and journalists – are perceived as untrustworthy. It is those figures specifically tasked with representing society, either as elected representatives or as professional reporters, who have lost credibility.To understand the crisis liberal democracy faces today – whether we identify this primarily in terms of “populism” or “post-truth” – it’s not enough to simply bemoan the rising cynicism of the public. We need also to consider some of the reasons why trust has been withdrawn. The infrastructure of fact has been undermined in part by a combination of technology and market forces – but we must seriously reckon with the underlying truth of the populists’ charge against the establishment today. Too often, the rise of insurgent political parties and demagogues is viewed as the source of liberalism’s problems, rather than as a symptom. But by focusing on trust, and the failure of liberal institutions to sustain it, we get a clearer sense of why this is happening now.The problem today is that, across a number of crucial areas of public life, the basic intuitions of populists have been repeatedly verified. One of the main contributors to this has been the spread of digital technology, creating vast data trails with the latent potential to contradict public statements, and even undermine entire public institutions. Whereas it is impossible to conclusively prove that a politician is morally innocent or that a news report is undistorted, it is far easier to demonstrate the opposite. Scandals, leaks, whistleblowing and revelations of fraud all serve to confirm our worst suspicions. While trust relies on a leap of faith, distrust is supported by ever-mounting piles of evidence. And in Britain, this pile has been expanding much faster than many of us have been prepared to admit.Confronted by the rise of populist parties and leaders, some commentators have described the crisis facing liberalism in largely economic terms – as a revolt among those “left behind” by inequality and globalisation. Another camp sees it primarily as the expression of cultural anxieties surrounding identity and immigration. There is some truth in both, of course – but neither gets to the heart of the trust crisis that populists exploit so ruthlessly. A crucial reason liberalism is in danger right now is that the basic honesty of mainstream politicians, journalists and senior officials is no longer taken for granted.There are copious explanations for Trump, Brexit and so on, but insufficient attention to what populists are actually saying, which focuses relentlessly on the idea of self-serving “elites” maintaining a status quo that primarily benefits them. On the right, Nigel Farage has accused inidual civil servants of seeking to sabotage Brexit for their own private ends. On the left, Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly refers to Britain’s “rigged” economic system. The promise to crack down on corruption and private lobbying is integral to the pitch made by figures such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro or Viktor Orbán.One of the great political riddles of recent years is that declining trust in “elites” is often encouraged and exploited by figures of far more dubious moral character – not to mention far greater wealth – than the technocrats and politicians being ousted. On the face of it, it would seem odd that a sense of “elite” corruption would play into the hands of hucksters and blaggards such as Donald Trump or Arron Banks. But the authority of these figures owes nothing to their moral character, and everything to their perceived willingness to blow the whistle on corrupt “insiders” dominating the state and media.Liberals – including those who occupy “elite” positions – may comfort themselves with the belief that these charges are ill-founded or exaggerated, or else that the populists offer no solutions to the failures they identify. After all, Trump has not “drained the swamp” of Washington lobbying. But this is to miss the point of how such rhetoric works, which is to chip away at the core faith on which liberalism depends, namely that power is being used in ways that represent the public interest, and that the facts published by the mainstream media are valid representations of reality.Populists target various centres of power, including dominant political parties, mainstream media, big business and the institutions of the state, including the judiciary. The chilling phrase “enemies of the people” has recently been employed by Donald Trump to describe those broadcasters and newspapers he dislikes (such as CNN and the New York Times), and by the Daily Mail to describe high court judges, following their 2016 ruling that Brexit would require parliamentary consent. But on a deeper level, whether it is the judiciary, the media or the independent civil service that is being attacked is secondary to a more important allegation: that public life in general has become fraudulent.How does this allegation work? One aspect of it is to dispute the very possibility that a judge, reporter or expert might act in a disinterested, objective fashion. For those whose authority depends on separating their public duties from their personal feelings, having their private views or identities publicised serves as an attack on their credibility. But another aspect is to gradually blur the distinctions between different varieties of expertise and authority, with the implication that politicians, journalists, judges, regulators and officials are effectively all working together.It is easy for rival professions to argue that they have little in common with each other, and are often antagonistic to each other. Ostensibly, these disparate centres of expertise and power hold each other in check in various ways, producing a pluralist system of checks and balances. Twentieth-century defenders of liberalism, such as the American political scientist Robert Dahl, often argued that it didn’t matter how much power was concentrated in the hands of inidual authorities, as long as no single political entity was able to monopolise power. The famous liberal ideal of a “separation of powers” (distinguishing executive, legislative and judicial branches of government), so influential in the framing of the US constitution, could persist so long as different domains of society hold one another up to critical scrutiny.But one thing that these erse professions and authorities do have in common is that they trade primarily in words and symbols. By lumping together journalists, judges, experts and politicians as a single homogeneous “liberal elite”, it is possible to treat them all as indulging in a babble of jargon, political correctness and, ultimately, lies. Their status as public servants is demolished once their claim to speak honestly is thrown into doubt. One way in which this is done is by bringing their private opinions and tastes before the public, something that social media and email render far easier. Tensions and contradictions between the public face of, say, a BBC reporter, and their private opinions and feelings, are much easier to discover in the age of Twitter.Whether in the media, politics or academia, liberal professions suffer a vulnerability that a figure such as Trump doesn’t, in that their authority hangs on their claim to speak the truth. A recent sociological paper called The Authentic Appeal of the Lying Demagogue, by US academics Oliver Hahl, Minjae Kim and Ezra Zuckerman Sivan, draws a distinction between two types of lies. The first, “special access lies”, may be better termed “insider lies”. This is dishonesty from those trusted to truthfully report facts, who abuse that trust by failing to state what they privately know to be true. (The authors give the example of Bill Clinton’s infamous claim that he “did not have sexual relations with that woman”.)The second, which they refer to as “common knowledge lies”, are the kinds of lies told by Donald Trump about the size of his election victory or the crowds at his inauguration, or the Vote Leave campaign’s false claims about sending “£350m a week to the EU”. These lies do not pretend to be bound by the norm of honesty in the first place, and the listener can make up their own mind what to make of them.What the paper shows is that, where politics comes to be viewed as the domain of “insider” liars, there is a seductive authenticity, even a strange kind of honesty, about the “common knowledge” liar. The rise of highly polished, professional politicians such as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton exacerbated the sense that politics is all about strategic concealment of the truth, something that the Iraq war seemed to confirm as much as anything. Trump or Farage may have a reputation for fabricating things, but they don’t (rightly or wrongly) have a reputation for concealing things, which grants them a form of credibility not available to technocrats or professional politicians.At the same time, and even more corrosively, when elected representatives come to be viewed as “insider liars”, it turns out that other professions whose job it is to report the truth – journalists, experts, officials – also suffer a slump in trust. Indeed, the distinctions between all these fact-peddlers start to look irrelevant in the eyes of those who’ve given up on the establishment altogether. It is this type of all-encompassing disbelief that creates the opportunity for rightwing populism in particular. Trump voters are more than twice as likely to distrust the media as those who voted for Clinton in 2016, according to the annual Edelman Trust Barometer, which adds that the four countries currently suffering the most “extreme trust losses” are Italy, Brazil, South Africa and the US.It’s one thing to measure public attitudes, but quite another to understand what shapes them. Alienation and disillusionment develop slowly, and without any single provocation. No doubt economic stagnation and soaring inequality have played a role – but we should not discount the growing significance of scandals that appear to discredit the honesty and objectivity of “liberal elites”. The misbehaviour of elites did not “cause” Brexit, but it is striking, in hindsight, how little attention was paid to the accumulation of scandal and its consequences for trust in the establishment.The 2010 edition of the annual British Social Attitudes survey included an ominous finding. Trust in politicians, already low, had suffered a fresh slump, with a majority of people saying politicians never tell the truth. But at the same time, interest in politics had mysteriously risen.To whom would this newly engaged section of the electorate turn if they had lost trust in “politicians”? One answer was clearly Ukip, who experienced their greatest electoral gains in the years that followed, to the point of winning the most seats in the 2014 elections for the European parliament. Ukip’s surge, which initially appeared to threaten the Conservative party, was integral to David Cameron’s decision to hold a referendum on EU membership. One of the decisive (and unexpected) factors in the referendum result was the number of voters who went to the polls for the first time, specifically to vote leave.What might have prompted the combination of angry disillusionment and intensifying interest that was visible in the 2010 survey? It clearly predated the toughest years of austerity. But there was clearly one event that did more than any other to weaken trust in politicians: the MPs’ expenses scandal, which blew up in May 2009 thanks to a drip-feed of revelations published by the Daily .Following as it did so soon after a disaster of world-historic proportions – the financial crisis – the full significance of the expenses scandal may have been forgotten. But its ramifications were vast. For one thing, it engulfed many of the highest reaches of power in Westminster: the Speaker of the House of Commons, the home secretary, the secretary of state for communities and local government and the chief secretary to the treasury all resigned. Not only that, but the rot appeared to have infected all parties equally, validating the feeling that politicians had more in common with each other (regardless of party loyalties) than they did with decent, ordinary people.Many of the issues that “elites” deal with are complex, concerning law, regulation and economic analysis. We can all see the fallout of the financial crisis, for instance, but the precise causes are disputed and hard to fathom. By contrast, everybody understands expense claims, and everybody knows lying and exaggerating are among the most basic moral failings even a child understands they are wrong. This may be unfair to the hundreds of honest MPs and to the dozens whose misdemeanours fell into a murky area around the “spirit” of the rules. But the sense of a mass stitch-up was deeply – and understandably – entrenched.The other significant thing about the expenses scandal was the way it set a template for a decade of elite scandals – most of which also involved lies, leaks and dishonest denials. One year later, there was another leak from a vast archive of government data: in 2010, WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of US military field reports from Iraq and Afghanistan. With the assistance of newspapers including the New York Times, Der Spiegel, the  and Le Monde, these “war logs” disclosed horrifying details about the conduct of US forces and revealed the Pentagon had falsely denied knowledge of various abuses. While some politicians expressed moral revulsion with what had been exposed, the US and British governments blamed WikiLeaks for endangering their troops, and the leaker, Chelsea Manning, was jailed for espionage.In 2011, the phone-hacking scandal put the press itself under the spotlight. It was revealed that senior figures in News International and the politan police had long been aware of the extent of phone-hacking practices – and they had lied about how much they knew. Among those implicated was the prime minister’s communications director, former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who was forced to resign his post and later jailed. By the end of 2011, the News of the World had been closed down, the Leveson inquiry was underway, and the entire Murdoch empire was shaking.The biggest scandal of 2012 was a different beast altogether, involving unknown men manipulating a number that very few people had even heard of. The number in question, the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, is meant to represent the rate at which banks are willing to loan to each other. What was surreal, in an age of complex derivatives and high-frequency trading algorithms, was that this number was calculated on the basis of estimates declared by each bank on a daily basis, and accepted purely on trust. The revelation that a handful of brokers had conspired to alter Libor for private gain (with possible costs to around 250,000 UK mortgage-holders, among others) may have been difficult to fully comprehend, but it gave the not unreasonable impression of an industry enriching itself in a criminal fashion at the public’s expense. Bob Diamond, the CEO of Barclays, the bank at the centre of the conspiracy, resigned in July 2012.Towards the end of that year, the media was caught in another prolonged crisis, this time at the BBC. Horror greeted the broadcast of the ITV documentary The Other Side of Jimmy Savile in October 2012. How many people had known about his predatory sexual behaviour, and for how long? Why had the police abandoned earlier investigations? And why had BBC Newsnight dropped its own film about Savile, due to be broadcast shortly after his death in 2011? The police swiftly established Operation Yewtree to investigate historic sexual abuse allegations, while the BBC established independent commissions into what had gone wrong. But a sense lingered that neither the BBC nor the police had really wanted to know the truth of these matters for the previous 40 years.It wasn’t long before it was the turn of the corporate world. In September 2014, a whistleblower revealed that Tesco had exaggerated its half-yearly profits by £250m, increasing the figure by around a third. An accounting fiddle on this scale clearly had roots at a senior managerial level. Sure enough, four senior executives were suspended the same month and three were charged with fraud two years later. A year later, it emerged that Volkswagen had systematically and deliberately tinkered with emissions controls in their vehicles, so as to dupe regulators in tests, but then pollute liberally the rest of the time. The CEO, Martin Winterkorn, resigned.“We didn’t really learn anything from WikiLeaks we didn’t already presume to be true,” the philosopher Slavoj Žižek observed in 2014. “But it is one thing to know it in general and another to get concrete data.” The nature of all these scandals suggests the emergence of a new form of “facts”, in the shape of a leaked archive – one that, crucially, does not depend on trusting the secondhand report of a journalist or official. These revelations are powerful and consequential precisely because they appear to directly confirm our fears and suspicions. Resentment towards “liberal elites” would no doubt brew even in the absence of supporting evidence. But when that evidence arises, things become far angrier, even when the data – such as Hillary Clinton’s emails – isn’t actually very shocking.This is by no means an exhaustive list of the scandals of the past decade, nor are they all of equal significance. But viewing them together provides a better sense of how the suspicions of populists cut through. Whether or not we continue to trust in politicians, journalists or officials, we have grown increasingly used to this pattern in which a curtain is dramatically pulled back, to reveal those who have been lying to or defrauding the public.Another pattern also begins to emerge. It’s not just that isolated iniduals are unmasked as corrupt or self-interested (something that is as old as politics), but that the establishment itself starts to appear deceitful and dubious. The distinctive scandals of the 21st century are a combination of some very basic and timeless moral failings (greed and dishonesty) with technologies of exposure that expose malpractice on an unprecedented scale, and with far more dramatic results.Perhaps the most important feature of all these revelations was that they were definitely scandals, and not merely failures: they involved deliberate efforts to defraud or mislead. Several involved sustained cover-ups, delaying the moment of truth for as long as possible.Several of the scandals ended with high profile figures behind bars. Jail terms satisfy some of the public demand that the “elites” pay for their dishonesty, but they don’t repair the trust that has been damaged. On the contrary, there’s a risk that they affirm the cry for retribution, after which the quest for punishment is only ramped up further. Chants of “lock her up” continue to reverberate around Trump rallies.In addition to their conscious and deliberate nature, a second striking feature of these scandals was the ambiguous role played by the media. On the one hand, the reputation of the media has taken a pummelling over the past decade, egged on by populists and conspiracy theorists who accuse the “mainstream media” of being allied to professional political leaders, and who now have the benefit of social media through which to spread this message.The moral authority of newspapers may never have been high, but the grisly revelations that journalists hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler represented a new low in the public standing of the press. The Leveson inquiry, followed soon after by the Savile revelations and Operation Yewtree, generated a sense of a media class who were adept at exposing others, but equally expert at concealing the truth of their own behaviours.On the other hand, it was newspapers and broadcasters that enabled all of this to come to light at all. The extent of phone hacking was eventually exposed by the , the MPs’ expenses by the , Jimmy Savile by ITV, and the “war logs” reported with the aid of several newspapers around the world simultaneously.But the media was playing a different kind of role from the one traditionally played by journalists and newspapers, with very different implications for the status of truth in society. A backlog of data and allegations had built up in secret, until eventually a whistle was blown. An archive existed that the authorities refused to acknowledge, until they couldn’t resist the pressure to do so any longer. Journalists and whistleblowers were instrumental in removing the pressure valve, but from that point on, truth poured out unpredictably. While such torrents are underway, there is no way of knowing how far they may spread or how long they may last.The era of “big data” is also the era of “leaks”. Where traditional “sleaze” could topple a minister, several of the defining scandals of the past decade have been on a scale so vast that they exceed any inidual’s responsibility. The Edward Snowden revelations of 2013, the Panama Papers leak of 2015 and the HSBC files (revealing organised tax evasion) all involved the release of tens of thousands or even millions of documents. Paper-based bureaucracies never faced threats to their legitimacy on this scale.The power of commissions and inquiries to make sense of so much data is not to be understated, nor is the integrity of those newspapers and whistleblowers that helped bring misdemeanours to light. In cases such as MPs’ expenses, some newspapers even invited their readers to help search these vast archives for treasure troves, like human algorithms sorting through data. But it is hard to imagine that the net effect of so many revelations was to build trust in any publicly visible institutions. On the contrary, the discovery that “elites” have been blocking access to a mine of incriminating data is perfect fodder for conspiracy theories. In his 2010 memoir, A Journey, Tony Blair confessed that legislating for freedom of information was one of his biggest regrets, which gave a glimpse of how transparency is viewed from the centre of power.Following the release of the war logs by WikiLeaks, nobody in any position of power claimed that the data wasn’t accurate (it was, after all, the data, and not a journalistic report). Nor did they offer any moral justification for what was revealed. Defence departments were left making the flimsiest of arguments – that it was better for everyone if they didn’t know how war was conducted. It may well be that the House of Commons was not fairly represented by the MPs’ expenses scandal, that most City brokers are honest, or that the VW emissions scam was a one-off within the car industry. But scandals don’t work through producing fair or representative pictures of the world they do so by blowing the lid on hidden truths and lies. Where whistleblowing and leaking become the dominant form of truth-telling, the authority of professional truth-tellers – reporters, experts, professionals, broadcasters – is thrown into question.The term “illiberal democracy” is now frequently invoked to describe states such as Hungary under Viktor Orbán or Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In contrast to liberal democracy, this model of authoritarian populism targets the independence of the judiciary and the media, ostensibly on behalf of “the people”.Brexit has been caused partly by distrust in “liberal elites”, but the anxiety is that it is also accelerating a drift towards “illiberalism”. There is a feeling at large, albeit among outspoken remainers, that the BBC has treated the leave campaign and Brexit itself with kid gloves, for fear of provoking animosity. More worrying was the discovery by openDemocracy in October that the politan police were delaying their investigation into alleged breaches of electoral law by the leave campaign due to what a Met spokesperson called “political sensitivities”. The risk at the present juncture is that key civic institutions will seek to avoid exercising scrutiny and due process, for fear of upsetting their opponents.Britain is not an “illiberal democracy”, but the credibility of our elites is still in trouble, and efforts to placate their populist opponents may only make matters worse. At the more extreme end of the spectrum, the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, has used his celebrity and social media reach to cast doubt on the judiciary and the BBC at once.Yaxley-Lennon has positioned himself as a freedom fighter, revealing “the truth” about Muslim men accused of grooming underage girls by violating legal rules that restrict reporting details of ongoing trials. Yaxley-Lennon was found guilty of contempt of court and jailed (he was later released after the court of appeal ordered a retrial, and the case has been referred to the attorney general), but this only deepened his appeal for those who believed the establishment was complicit in a cover-up, and ordinary people were being deliberately duped.The political concern right now is that suspicions of this nature – that the truth is being deliberately hidden by an alliance of “elites” – are no longer the preserve of conspiracy theorists, but becoming increasingly common. Our current crisis has too many causes to enumerate here, and it is impossible to apportion blame for a collective collapse of trust – which is as much a symptom of changes in media technologies as it is of any moral failings on the part of elites.But what is emerging now is what the social theorist Michel Foucault would have called a new “regime of truth” – a different way of organising knowledge and trust in society. The advent of experts and government administrators in the 17th century created the platform for a distinctive liberal solution to this problem, which rested on the assumption that knowledge would reside in public records, newspapers, government files and journals. But once the integrity of these people and these instruments is cast into doubt, an opportunity arises for a new class of political figures and technologies to demand trust instead.The project that was launched over three centuries ago, of trusting elite iniduals to know, report and judge things on our behalf, may not be viable in the long term, at least not in its existing form. It is tempting to indulge the fantasy that we can reverse the forces that have undermined it, or else batter them into retreat with an even bigger arsenal of facts. But this is to ignore the more fundamental ways in which the nature of trust is changing.The main feature of the emerging regime is that truth is now assumed to reside in hidden archives of data, rather than in publicly available facts. This is what is affirmed by scandals such as MPs’ expenses and the leak of the Iraq war logs – and more recently in the #MeToo movement, which also occurred through a sudden and voluminous series of revelations, generating a crisis of trust. The truth was out there, just not in the public domain. In the age of email, social media and cameraphones, it is now common sense to assume that virtually all social activity is generating raw data, which exists out there somewhere. Truth becomes like the lava below the earth’s crust, which periodically bursts through as a volcano.What role does this leave for the traditional, analogue purveyors of facts and figures? What does it mean to “report” the news in an age of reflexive disbelief? Newspapers have been grappling with this question for some time now some have decided to refashion themselves as portals to the raw data, or curators of other people’s content. But it is no longer intuitively obvious to the public why they should be prepared to take a journalist’s word for something, when they can witness the thing itself in digital form. There may be good answers to these questions, but they are not obvious ones.Instead, a new type of heroic truth-teller has emerged in tandem with these trends. This is the inidual who appears brave enough to call bullshit on the rest of the establishment – whether that be government agencies, newspapers, business, political parties or anything else. Some are whistleblowers, others are political leaders, and others are more like conspiracy theorists or trolls. The problem is that everyone has a different heroic truth-teller, because we’re all preoccupied by different bullshit. There is no political alignment between figures such as Chelsea Manning and Nigel Farage what they share is only a willingness to defy the establishment and break consensus.If a world where everyone has their own truth-tellers sounds dangerously like relativism, that’s because it is. But the roots of this new and often unsettling “regime of truth” don’t only lie with the rise of populism or the age of big data. Elites have largely failed to understand that this crisis is about trust rather than facts – which may be why they did not detect the rapid erosion of their own credibility.Unless liberal institutions and their defenders are willing to reckon with their own inability to sustain trust, the events of the past decade will remain opaque to them. And unless those institutions can rediscover aspects of the original liberal impulse – to keep different domains of power separate, and put the disinterested pursuit of knowledge before the pursuit of profit – then the present trends will only intensify, and no quantity of facts will be sufficient to resist. Power and authority will accrue to a combination of decreasingly liberal states and digital platforms – interrupted only by the occasional outcry as whistles are blown and outrages exposed.• William Davies is a sociologist and political economist at Goldsmiths.

The move could result in the maximum number of non-EU medics able to come rising to as many as 3,000.The length of time young doctors from outside the EU are able to stay in Britain under the scheme may also rise from two to three years, according to well-placed sources.The change comes as the government is under pressure to explain how its intention to move to a new immigration system after Brexit, with right of entry dependent on skills, will help alleviate NHS under-staffing.Ministers believe the NHS-wide shortage of medics is so acute, especially in hospitals, that they have to lift the cap on the number who can come in under the MTI, even at the risk of provoking a row about immigration.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has been lobbying the Home Office over the issue in recent months. He recently wrote to Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, to suggest the change and has played a key role in making it happen.Senior doctors with whom Hancock has discussed the issue say he “fully appreciates” the depth of the NHS’s inability to recruit and retain enough medics and the impact it is increasingly having on patient care, for example forcing some A\u0026ampE units to close temporarily or permanently.The move is likely to be unveiled in the NHS long-term plan, due out in mid-December, soon after the “meaningful vote” by MPs on Brexit on 11 December. It will set out how the service in England sees its key priorities for the next decade and how it will spend the extra £20.5bn a year in funding it is due to receive by 2023-24.The NHS in England is short of 9,337 doctors, according to the latest official figures on staffing, which were published on Thursday by the regulator NHS Improvement. Although that is down from the 11,616 vacancies it had three months ago NHS bosses say that staffing problems remain their biggest headache and are compromising the quality of care they can provide.Ministers have been persuaded that expanding the MTI will not prompt a backlash because doctors coming to Britain that way do not count towards the immigration total. That is because the MTI counts as an exchange scheme that shares knowledge, experience and best practice.The young doctors are trainees who spend two years learning from an NHS consultant, and help fill medical rotas in hospitals, before returning to their home countries, which benefit from their enhanced skills.Health Education England, the NHS body in charge of the education and training of health service staff, supports boosting MTI numbers. Medical groups, including the Royal College of Physicians, have also been lobbying ministers to approve the change.“The MTI provides important benefits to the NHS and global healthcare development. The NHS benefits by employing talented international doctors in places that have not been able to attract suitable trainees. These posts would either have remained unfilled or would be covered by expensive locums,” said Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers.“There are huge workforce shortages across the NHS, and we will need to rely on international doctors to help us deliver services, to complement our homegrown talent and the expansion of medical schools.“Our hope is that there will be continued support within the NHS long-term plan and immigration white paper for the MTI, especially in the face of enormous pressures on overstretched teams,” Mortimer added.The scheme is administered by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents the professional interests of the UK’s 240,000 doctors.“We don’t know what’s in the long-term plan, but if this increase is true, it’s good news. The academy has long argued for an increase in the number of MTI doctors who can contribute to the NHS as they come to the UK to expand their training,” said Prof Carrie MacEwen, its chair.“The MTI scheme is a win all round. An increase in international trainees will help alleviate the pressures on the frontline in the NHS,” she added.A government spokesperson praised the MTI but refused to answer questions about its planned expansion. “This government welcomes the role of the MTI in allowing overseas medical staff the chance to train in the UK, observe clinical practice and to learn vital skills. While they are training in the UK, these international doctors gain state-of-the art skills and experience, which they can take back and use to benefit healthcare globally.“We are absolutely clear that these roles are not designed to fill substantive vacancies, but offer a valuable training opportunity for doctors from overseas. As with the other government authorised exchange schemes, the MTI scheme is subject to regular review to ensure it continues to meet its aims and those of the immigration system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca7b235595fa0b3ae1cf652ac0b45d5c62f132f/0_7_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25fe90cc7b0ea5fc5cd29a228e549932","title":"mps call for rogue landlords to lose properties","story":"During debate, MPs from all sides urge housing minister to introduce new seizure powersMPs have called on the government to confiscate properties from the country’s worst landlords after a series of revelations about tenants being exploited by rogue sections of the private rented housing sector.The calls followed a hard-hitting select committee report in April, as well as a joint  and ITV News investigation which last month revealed that convicted landlords ruled unfit to rent out their properties were continuing to operate by exploiting a gap in the law.During a debate on the committee’s recommendations on Thursday, MPs from across the Commons urged the housing minister Heather Wheeler to introduce new powers to seize properties of the worst landlords.“They’re making lots of money out of it, they’re making proceeds out of their crime. Let’s take off them the asset that enables them to do that.”Wheeler failed to respond to the request during the Westminster Hall debate and Betts later told the : “I don’t know why the government is resisting it. Confiscation and publicising those criminal landlords – that will be the focus now of trying to get serious change.”The investigation by the  and ITV also revealed that central government’s rogue landlord database was completely empty six months after its launch – and even when it finally contained entries the public would be barred from accessing it. The finding led to an U-turn by Theresa May, who pledged to open up the database to tenants.There is cross-party support for both publicising the conduct of the sector’s worst offenders as well as confiscating criminal landlords’ properties, which was recommended in the April report.During Thursday’s debate, Bob Blackman, a Conservative member of the committee member, said: “The sad reality is that if landlords fail the fit and proper person test to be landlords and they’re banned then all their tenants should know about it. That just makes sense. So to have a position where a landlord can be banned in one borough and carry on renting in others just does not make sense at all.“I agree that in the most serious cases just a fine becomes part of doing the business. Having the ability to confiscate the property and to protect the tenants from the behaviours of rogue or criminal landlords has to be the final issue.”Wheeler would not comment about confiscating property and would only refer to councils’ existing powers. She said: “Councils already have a range of powers to tackle rogue landlords, including the ability to take over the management of privately rented properties.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab25e9e6428a84259629e31e0c9baafc4a2efd49/0_213_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36523615a0656f2836e84ef710325297","title":"woman pregnancy turned out 26kg ovarian cyst","story":"Keely Favell lost third of her body weight after operation to take out growth discovered by obstetric ultrasoundA woman has told of how an ovarian cyst weighing 26kg (57lb) was removed from her body after doctors insisted at first that she must be pregnant.Keely Favell lost a third of her body weight after surgery to remove the growth. She had started to gain weight in 2014, but only went to see a doctor about it in 2016 after she blacked out while at work.Despite numerous inconclusive blood tests coming back, a GP decided she was pregnant, Favell wrote in a blogpost describing her experience.“Looking at me, anyone would have assumed I was nine months pregnant, so naturally they referred me to my local hospital for a pregnancy ultrasound,” said the 28-year-old from Swansea.The ultrasound led to an emergency CT scan which showed she had a large ovarian mass, prompting a referral to a high-risk obstetrics consultant who told her surgery was a “must” and that four weeks later she would be “cut open from my chest bone all the way down to my pelvic bone, pretty much like an old-fashioned C-section.”She wrote of undergoing four hours of surgery at Swansea’s Singleton hospital in March last year to a remove a cyst that she later nicknamed Mr Whippy.Favell said she was home four days later, adding: “My recovery since has been plain sailing and although there have been a few hiccups along the way, some of which are still yet to be sorted, I am now of much better health than that of last year. Both physically and mentally.”She told the BBC that the cyst appeared to grow so slowly at first that she did not believe anything was wrong. “I’ve been with my partner Jamie Gibbins for 10 years and we did wonder a few times if I was pregnant, but we did home tests and they always ruled it out,” she said.She said it was so embarrassing explaining to people she was not pregnant that she decided to go along with well-wishers who asked her about her due date.

This was because the 23-year‑old, despite holding a British passport through his English father, arrived in the UK in 2015, after his 18th birthday. Under the new rules, British citizens, or those born in the UK, require three years of residency to be selected, provided they have not played as a “local” in an overseas competition in this time.The ECB has stressed the rule change is not about an inidual player and it brings English cricket in line with rest of the world. But Johnny Grave, the chief executive of Cricket West Indies, has nevertheless expressed his dismay that Archer, who rose through the Barbados system and played international Under-19s cricket for West Indies, could soon be representing another country.“I hope no other West Indian cricketers follow that path and hope it doesn’t lead to counties doing their talent ID in the Caribbean, taking our players into the public school system and then on to offering them lucrative long-term county contracts and then possibly on to playing for England.”Archer’s decision to leave the Caribbean for Sussex, where he rose to prominence in club cricket before signing for the county, came after missing out on selection for the Under‑19s World Cup in 2014. Though he did not attend public school in the UK, the switch followed advice from Chris Jordan, who also grew up in Barbados and moved to England aged 15 via a scholarship at Dulwich College in south-east London.The ECB’s new residency rules require a player to be in the country for 210 days a year between April and March and with Archer committed to playing for Hobart Hurricanes in Australia’s Big Bash League this winter – with whom he shot to global prominence last year and then secured a lucrative deal in the Indian Premier League – he will not have completed his third year until mid-March.It means the right-arm quick will likely miss out on the tour to the Caribbean that starts in January, with the one-day series being England’s final five matches in the format before they submit their provisional World Cup squad on 23 April. With their attack seemingly short of a bowler who can consistently hit 90mph, however, there is a chance Archer may still enter the selection debate.As well as reducing their self-imposed seven-year residency criteria, the ECB board has also signed off on the playing regulations for its new 100-ball competition from 2020. As expected, the format will be 10 blocks of 10 balls for each innings, with bowlers allowed to bowl five or 10 of these at a time but no more than 20 in total.A Barbados-born fast bowler and hard-hitting lower-order batsman who holds a British passport through his English father and plays for Sussex. He was serving a  seven-year qualification period to play for England (due to be completed in the winter of 2022) but following the rule change, should now be eligible for England selection by mid-March once a third year of spending 210 days in the country has been completed.What is all the fuss about?With an ability to bowl at 90mph and at the death in white-ball cricket, excitement about Archer began from the moment he made his first-team debut for Sussex in 2016. But it was when playing overseas Twenty20 cricket last winter, and an a eye-catching spell for Hobart Hurricanes in Australia’s Big Bash League in particular, that his stock rose exponentially and a £800,000 contract in the Indian Premier League followed.Why isn’t he playing for West Indies?Despite having come through the Barbados age-groups and having played Under-19s cricket for West Indies, his omission from the U19s World Cup in 2014 led to disillusionment with the system in the Caribbean. After encouragement from his fellow Bajan, the Sussex and England all-rounder Chris Jordan, Archer then moved to the UK the following summer, where he played league cricket for both Middleton and Horsham before cracking the first team at Sussex in 2016. He has previously described representing England as his\u0026nbsp“dream”.What are his chances of playing the World Cup and Ashes next year?England have just five ODIs in the Caribbean in February before their provisional World Cup squad is named on 23 April, all of which come before Archer is eligible. It would therefore represent a gamble of sorts to fast-track him into the set-up and one that Eoin Morgan, the captain, has previously downplayed. Joe Root and the national selector, Ed Smith, may yet be tempted by his additional pace in the Ashes series that follows, however."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ed974ec359a907ed36110eb64efb20a5ae41ec5/59_137_4296_2577/master/4296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=740f0d2cfb60b242b4e228f133887562","title":"magnus carlsen my last world championship match chess","story":"As Magnus Carlsen sat in his dressing room, euphoric and chatty after finally suppressing the stubborn resistance of Fabiano Caruana to retain his world chess title, he made a stark confession. “If I had lost, it could very well have been my last world championship match.”The words came as a thunderous bolt from the blue and they are bound to send tremors through the chess world. After all, Carlsen has been the world No 1 since 2010 and would have been a warm favourite to regain his title in 2020 if he had lost. Yet, for the first time, here he was acknowledging that he would have contemplated turning his back on the biggest prize in his sport at the age of 27.The brilliant Norwegian, who retained his title with a thumping 3-0 rapid-play victory over Caruana on Wednesday after all 12 classical games were drawn, was just as frank when asked whether he could ever again scale the heights of his peak Fide rating of 2,882, the highest in history, which he obtained in his early twenties.“It is going to be very difficult,” says Carlsen, whose ranking now stands at 2,835, three ahead of his American rival. “It is a lot about the mindset. There is no pure chess reason in terms of understanding the game that I should play worse than I have before. But these games show that I have not been able to take all my chances. I need to work on that to be even sharper the next time.”At least there will be a next time. Before the match Carlsen’s frustrations with his performances had led his sister Ellen to hint that Carlsen might retire if he was defeated. When asked whether such a course of action was really on his mind, he replies: “For sure,” before clarifying his position. “If I had lost, it could very well have been my last world championship match.”When pressed why, Carlsen replies: “I don’t know. I wouldn’t have retired from chess but I might not have played another world championship match. But now we’ll see. I have a lot of time over the next two years to improve my game.”The sport certainly needs him to stick around. For these days the Norwegian is a bona fide celebrity, guest-starring on The Simpsons, modelling for G-Star Raw and making $8m (£6.25m) a year according to Forbes magazine. Such is Carlsen’s popularity in Norway that his matches were shown live on NRK, the equivalent of BBC One, with Wednesday’s tie–breaks breaking all previous records for Carlsen’s games. Three million of the country’s five million population watched at least some part of the match.The Magnus effect has extended to participation levels in his country, with the Norwegian Chess Federation confirming that close to half a million play regularly online. Interest in the match also spread far beyond Norway with the website Chess saying that millions had watched its live coverage over the 20 days.It surely helped that there was plenty of intrigue off the board too. Early in the match, images of Caruana’s preparation leaked online, leaving many to speculate whether this was a huge blunder or a cunning ruse to throw his opponent off the scent – while Carlsen arrived for game 9 with a black eye after smashing into a Norwegian journalist while playing football on a rest day.The contest finally ended on Wednesday after more than 50 hours of play over 15 games, but it might have been a much shorter story if Carlsen had converted a vastly superior position in the first game. However, he was unable to navigate his way through the battle fog and the match quickly descended into the chess equivalent of trench warfare, with all 12 games of classical chess drawn.Some feared that Carlsen’s near‑legendary desire to win every game had turned into an altogether more human desire not to lose – especially when he offered a draw in a better position in game 12. Vladimir Kramnik, the world champion from 2000-2008, even suggested “this is not the Magnus we have come to know”, while Garry Kasparov, who held the title from 1985-2000, wondered whether Carlsen was losing his nerve.It turned out he was merely playing possum. In the rapid-play tie-breaks – where both players had 25 minutes to make all their moves – Carlsen was much more like his old self: his play turbo-charged and confident, his tenacity irresistible. “I always knew if it went to a tie-break I would have good chances,” he says.“On Tuesday, I just tried to relax, I played some football and got a good night’s sleep and when I woke up I felt very good. I knew from early on in game 1 that I had good chances. It was just a very good day.”Carlsen later celebrated his victory in the modest surroundings of Wetherspoons in Holborn, where he happily posed for pictures with fans. It was a welcome release after months of preparation that had involved hours of daily study along with regular football and basketball sessions, 30-60 minute runs, hot yoga and a largely vegetarian diet to get him into the best possible shape for the physical and psychological stresses of a world-title match.But not all had gone to plan and when asked whether he was looking forward to not bashing his head against Caruana’s ultra-solid Petroff defence, he laughs. “Yeah, for sure,” he says. “That is one of the things I need to improve on. My white openings in this match weren’t great and I barely got any playable positions. Fortunately, I played well with black to counter that.“The match shows Fabiano is at pretty much the same level as I am in classical chess right now. Huge credit to him, but that is not something I was completely satisfied with.”The result leaves Carlsen as the king of the chess world for at least another two years, given he is not due to face his next challenger until 2020. But the future of the championship itself is more of a dangling question. For many it remains the original E-Sport and the fact that such huge online audiences followed a game that emphasises the merits of thinking fast and slow, shows its potential. However, some players, such as the strong Dutch grandmaster Anish Giri, believe that so many draws in such a high-profile match could scare sponsors away.Carlsen believes that the world championship format needs to be spiced up, either with a longer format or more rapid games. “In general it’s good to incorporate more rapid and blitz in the world championship because to some extent it is a purer form of chess because preparation plays less of a role,” he says. “Instead, it is more about quick calculation, intuition and instinct, all of the things I think are important in chess. So I would like that – and also more games in the match to give more room for experiments and taking chances.”Whatever happens next Carlsen will fancy his chances. His powers may not be quite as supreme as they once were but he remains the man to beat and as he reminded his rivals yet again across three captivating weeks in London if you come for the king you best not miss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b8d1e88fa72b2f9ffddd453a3399bc805578469/157_0_2170_1302/master/2170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea5cce4e33b77c19b0c07a7f1360de9b","title":"wales ellis jenkins knee surgery cardiff blues rugby union","story":"Ellis Jenkins will require surgery after being hurt in the dying seconds of Wales’ victory over South Africa and the flanker may miss the rest of the season.Cardiff Blues confirmed he suffered “a significant knee injury” during last Saturday’s 20-11 win over the Springboks.No timescale has been put on the 25-year-old’s recovery but it would appear that Jenkins is facing a lengthy lay-off, potentially ruling him out of the Six Nations and possibly the rest of this season, although it is just under nine months until Wales’ opening World Cup warm-up game against England.

Let me repeat that: Sam Bailey has supported Beyoncé on tour.The X Factor loves a comeback narrative, and the big-voiced, big-haired Scarlett Lee has made it through to this year’s final despite the indignity of being eliminated during the show’s unnecessarily brutal six-chair challenge in 2017.Merseyside’s answer to Robbie Williams doing big band, the bequiffed, former Brookside star Ray Quinn was completely overshadowed in series three by overwhelming favourite Leona Lewis. He has settled into comfortable C-list fame since – as well as numerous theatre roles and an upcoming part in Hollyoaks, he also won the fourth series of Dancing on Ice in 2009.Paris-based musician Kevin Davy White brought some class to last year’s series, often performing stripped back or rocked-up versions of songs while playing an instrument and wearing a hat.Matthew “Matt” Terry was notable for two things: a really impressive and versatile fringe, and being the second ever victor to release an original song as their winner’s single. Unfortunately, it was a depressing, Ed Sheeran-penned yuletide flop called When Christmas Comes Around.Italian Andrea charmed the judges with his impassioned singing, love of pugs and apparent inability to stop smiling. An early favourite to win series 11, he ended up in third place after his one-trick performance technique, shouting loudly while pacing up and down, grew a little old.The incredibly named Ché Chesterman was a fan of the backwards cap, Jessie J-style over-emoting and black-framed glasses. His “vintage” vocals were often in danger of imploding, allowing the show to insert its favourite cliffhanger: a trip to the throat doctor and the inevitable crowd-pleasing big note.Despite series nine’s Lucy Spraggan often performing original songs, it was series 14 where that became the norm, with both eventual winners Rak-Su and runner-up Grace Davies constantly churning out self-penned musings. Davies’s lovely ballad Too Young was a highlight, hampered slightly by her reliance on a mannered, overly breathy delivery.Seven years after Steps called it a day for the first time, they were essentially reincarnated as this mildly terrifying brother-sister duo. Walsh famously hated them, probably for showing that pop can be fun, bright and throwaway and not just five identikit mannequins on stools.Dubbed “the singing binman” by the tabloids, season two runner-up Andy Abraham seems like a bit of a throwback now – a nice man using his nice voice to sing some nice covers while wearing a nice suit. Quite nice.The favourite for this year’s crown, Jamaican Dalton Harris comes with a proper reality TV-ready journey that involves poverty, determination and a sense of destiny. He can also, you know, sing really well, too.Reggie Zippy and Bollie Babeface (yes, amazing) had one trick and one trick only: mashing up unlikely pop songs with dancehall or reggae anthems, typically involving Fuse ODG, to create something unexpectedly entertaining. Obviously, once the show was over no one cared, but that is so often the brutal truth of The X Factor.After an admittedly lovely rendition of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face at boot camp, everyman Matt Cardle locked the mum vote to win series seven, despite being up against One Direction and Rebecca Ferguson, and almost being vaporised by Rihanna’s star quality during a hilariously mismatched duet in the final. Has gone on to enjoy a smattering of success, including a recent top 20 duet with Mel C.The X Factor has never really had a close relationship with the idea of cool, with the promising trio 5 After Midnight – whose audition performance of Drake’s One Dance has 3.5m views on YouTube – eventually reduced to cringing their way through awful mashups decided by Louis Walsh.Often decked out in what looked like the dregs of a Lady Gaga garage sale, Finland’s Saara Aalto married lung-busting vocals with a knowing sense of camp. Unsurprisingly, she has represented Finland at Eurovision on three separate occasions, most recently this May. She finished second last.Eight series in and The X Factor had found its groove, pairing big pop acts with retro-tinged soul singers who harked back to the so-called good old days. Liverpool’s talented Marcus Collins fit the latter brief, eventually hemmed in by 60s doo-wop stylings that saw him release a “unique” take on Seven Nation Army. Jack White probably hated it, which only makes it better.Best known for having his microphone swiped out of his hand by mentor Nicole Scherzinger during the 2012 final, Jahméne brought an understated soulfulness to proceedings despite looking like he might cry at any moment.Series nine winner Arthur has had a rocky relationship with The X Factor. In 2012, he released the biggest-selling winner’s single, Impossible, but was later dropped after using homophobic slurs in some, erm, battle raps. In 2016, he returned with new teeth and a new record deal, later scoring a UK No 1 with Say You Won’t Let Go. He’s also the owner of some truly awful tattoos.Yes, it’s a singing competition, blah blah blah, but The X Factor is also about entertainment, or it certainly used to be. That was epitomised by series six finalist Solomon, whose nice-enough performances were merely a taster for the often hilarious chatty bits afterwards.When Frankie Cocozza, AKA a child’s doodle of Pete Doherty, was booted off the live shows in series eight, it set the scene for the glorious return of Middlesbrough’s own Kelly Clarkson, Amelia Lily, who had been voted out in week one. A third-place finish was followed by one excellent single, the Xenomania-produced You Bring Me Joy.Pity poor Louisa Johnson, who became the first X Factor winner to be signed and then dropped without releasing an album, despite scoring two top 10 singles and releasing the actually very good Best Behaviour in 2017. This year’s Dirrty-esque Yes was her make-or-break single, eventually peaking at 65.The jury’s still out on boyband Rak-Su, who lit up last year’s series with a combination of self-penned bangers and a reliance on Sweet Female Attitude’s 2000 garage anthem Flowers. Rather than capitalise immediately on the R\u0026ampB-meets-afrobeats domination, they seem to have waited too long, with September’s Adina Howard-sampling I Want You to Freak stalling at 39.A contestant on this year’s I’m a Celebrity ... , Fleur East was electrifying the X Factor in 2014 with a thrilling version of Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk, in which she broke the TV talent show mould by singing and dancing simultaneously. The following year’s energetic Sax showed promise, but she was dropped in 2017.After series one winner Steve Brookstein flopped, a lot was riding on Shayne Ward’s broad shoulders. Primed as the UK’s answer to Justin Timberlake (he had a buzz cut), his debut single, That’s My Goal, shifted a million copies. The Max Martin co-penned If That’s OK With You, released in 2007, still bangs.There was something uncomplicated about little Joe McElderry, a young man your nan would love, who just enjoyed having a nice singsong. The end. His debut single proper, an unexpected cover of Norwegian band Donkeyboy’s hi-energy Ambitions, would be his last visit to the UK Top 10.Mixing crippling nerves with a rich, velvety voice, series seven runner-up Rebecca Ferguson was ripe for a proper X Factor journey. Her debut album, Heaven, set out her stall as the next Duffy or, everyone hoped, the new Adele all vintage soul and Radio 2-ready drivetime emotions.You get the feeling Olly Murs didn’t expect to have just released his sixth top two album in a row. Originally a hat-favouring placeholder for Robbie Williams as his career recovered after releasing Rudebox, Murs has gone on to mix a handful of effervescent bops with a smattering of just-above-average.The first X Factor boyband to really make their mark, finishing second in series five, JLS paired pectoral scraping T-shirts and Zumba-class-ready choreography with ludicrous dance-pop (The Club is Alive) and OTT ballads (Love You More). Extra marks for Aston Merrygold’s backflips, too.OK, here’s an opinion for you: Alexandra Burke deserved more. She could sing, she could dance, she held herself like a pop star, she snotted all over Beyoncé during the live final and, in Bad Boys, she had a proper, undeniable banger. Her second album, released in 2012, was appalling.If we are talking pure talent, then there can be only one winner. Leona Lewis’s honeyed vocals saw her win series three by a country mile, before 2007’s immaculate Bleeding Love turned her into a global superstar. But it couldn’t last, with a dip in song quality revealing the vacuum where a personality was supposed to be.It’s weird to think that One Direction, a global phenomenon who reshaped popular culture, didn’t win their series, finishing third behind Rebecca Ferguson and Matt Cardle. Perfect debut single What Makes You Beautiful set them on a journey that involved ludicrous merch opportunities, some lovely haircuts and the sense that by the end, they were pulling in different, erm, directions.Girlbands had had a torrid time on The X Factor (Bad Lashes anyone?) to the point where Little Mix, then called Rhythmix, had to convince the sceptical producers to put them through to the live shows in the first place. Fused together from four failed solo auditions, Jade, Perrie, Leigh-Anne and Jesy continued to prove people wrong, quickly looking like a proper girlband, while also maintaining inidual identities. They have also, so far, managed to sidestep the typical girlband trait of diminishing returns, with 2016’s bop-heavy fourth album Glory Days shifting more than a million copies in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a615f7b65218b155855566f972d41d80b61c47c/0_278_4890_2934/master/4890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdf1e2245df998c008f910dba25cb271","title":"us politics michael cohen live updates","story":"Post-midterms, this is a handy guide to the districts in the House where the party of the incumbent member of Congress is different than the presidential candidate who won it in 2016.Eric Bauman has resigned as chair of the California Democratic Party after allegations of sexual misconduct.Warren has also called for United States to withdraw from Afghanistan in her speech.In her foreign policy speech today, Elizabeth Warren has come out in opposition to the USMCA, the free trade agreement negotiated by the Trump Administration with Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA.Rudy Giuliani tried to distance Trump from Michael Cohen in an interview with the Daily Beast today.Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that he does not support the resolution advanced in the Senate yesterday to end U.S. support for the Saudi backed coalition in Yemen.He said “I don’t think the Yemen resolution is the smart way to go.” Instead, Ryan suggested sanctions under the Magnitsky Act as an alternative.The Trump administration took new steps today to undermine the Affordable Care Act.It published guidance that allows states to use federal subsidies for people buying health insurance outside the marketplace created by the ACA.

However, the intensity and duration of maternal care observed in the spider species is considered highly unusual.The observations focused on a species of jumping spider, normally found in Taiwan, which lives in nests and mimics the appearance of ants. The newly hatched spiderlings were found to be entirely dependent on nutritious spider milk, containing nearly four times the protein of cow’s milk, secreted and fed to them by their mothers.The scientists observed that the spiderlings first drank from droplets of spider milk left on the surface of the nest and then by directly sucking from the mother’s egg-laying opening.The spider mothers continued to care for and feed their offspring for nearly 40 days, long after they were able to forage on their own and almost until the point of sexual maturity.The milk was not critical to the offsprings’ survival, but appeared to boost their overall health and chances of survival as adults.The findings, by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Yunnan, are published in the journal Science."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The number of cars produced in October fell by 15,255 compared with the same month in 2017, with production for the home market dropping by 12.1 per cent in the fifth consecutive month of decline. Meanwhile, production for overseas markets dropped 9.3 per cent, although exports still command the biggest share of total output at 82.7 per cent.\u0026nbspIn the year so far, production is down 6.9 per cent compared to 2017. No-deal Brexit must be ruled out to save motor industry, warns SMMTJaguar Land Rover to stop production for two weeks as demand slumpsBMW to shut UK plant for at least a month on day of Brexit“The fifth consecutive month of decline for UK car manufacturing is undoubtedly concerning and, while a number of factors have been at play, there is no doubt that business and consumer uncertainty is having a significant impact,” said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. “With eight in 10 British-built cars destined for overseas markets, the majority to the EU, the sector’s dependence on exports cannot be downplayed. “Europe is our largest trading partner and securing the right Brexit agreement which allows free and frictionless trade is vital for the future health of our industry.”Car manufacturers have issued multiple warnings over the harm Brexit could do to the industry. Jaguar Land Rover’s chief executive, Ralf Speth, has warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead. The company has already moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”.Meanwhile, Honda has said a no-deal scenario would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while BMW said it would move a planned shutdown of its Mini plant in Oxford forward to coincide with the beginning of Brexit in order to minimise the risk of disruption.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Cathy Adams, who started her love affair with Instagram in 2012, says the world is better when we’re connected to it, while Helen Coffey, who has never used it,\u0026nbsprefuses to tie her ego to her travelsClick to followThe IndependentBanning social media is a progressive idea, but does it bite the hand that feeds?Why we should all use Instagram on holidayIt all started on 3 January 2012.\u0026nbspThat was the date of my first ever Instagram upload. It was of a saucer of tea in some dingy burlesque club near Chancery Lane. It got zero likes – probably because who drinks tea at a burlesque club?\u0026nbspThings got better from there.5 April 2014: 11 people liked a picture of me posing with a giant frozen margarita in Tijuana. Nine people liked a picture of my feet standing on a glass floor on the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower in Chicago a few months later. This summer, countless people commented on the braggy snaps of me swimming in glass-clear waters in the Males (because… Males).Disappointingly, only 48 people liked a picture of me at my wedding, whereas 137 liked a candid (ish) pic of me laughing with Gordon Ramsay at his Bread Street Kitchen in Hong Kong.Sarah Michelle Gellar ‘terribly sorry for fat shaming’ Instagram postYou always remember the numbers. As a natural egotist, uploading a carefully curated snap to the channel and watching the likes roll in makes me feel all kind of zippy. After all, these Instagrams have timestamped my life since 2012.That’s not to say that Instagram doesn’t often behave. The bad things are myriad: waiting for Instagrammers to take pictures of your pancakes at brunch, or then artfully arranging your coffee and sunglasses and Moleskine around a cold plate of eggs. Trying to enjoy the pink-purple-blue sunset on Bali’s Seminyak beach and finding you have a row of Instagram screens blocking the view. Or the ninth circle of Instagram hell, which is queueing for a snap of Santorini’s sunset or for the small-time sunflower field in Canada which banned visitors thanks to Instagram overload.These are bad things, but it doesn’t mean Instagram is a Bad Thing: even if the Vienna Tourism Board currently thinks differently.Its current campaign “See Vienna, not #Vienna” is asking tourists to “see the city behind your pics”. It’s a progressive idea, particularly because so much destination marketing rests on the halo effect on social media. (Although its Instagram page, endorsed by almost 100,000 people, is still asking snappers to share ‘Vienna pics by including #ViennaNow’.)\u0026nbspSome Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole the platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantageIt’s a clever campaign, but one that rather bites the hand that feeds. Some Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole\u0026nbspthe platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantage.Mostly because of the staggering number of users. More than one in eight of us globally have Instagram. Users upload 400 million Instagram Stories a day. There are commercial gains, too: more than 72 per cent of users have bought something they saw on Instagram, according to Business Insider. For a tourist board, this provides a rich seam of free (free!) content, even if many of the snaps don’t deserve to be hung on the mantelpiece. Even the Vienna Tourism Board isn’t above using Instagram indirectly to promote its new campaign.Few people argue that being more connected than ever before – through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even, howl, LinkedIn – is a bad thing. After all, it’s the primary reason so many people travel: they want to be connected to another world. Instagram facilitates that, albeit virtually. When I lived abroad, Instagram was one of the many platforms I had at my disposal to give a sneak flavour into my life in Asia. (Instagram was for delicious food pictures, Twitter was for snark.) It was also useful when I didn’t want to have janky Skype calls with friendseditorsmy mother – they could simply check into my Instagram to figure out where I was and what I was looking at.103rd floor of the Willis TowerFor journalists, no platform can be discounted: we need all the tools we can get to understand our audience. And if our audience is on Instagram, then we need to be on Instagram too. Especially working in travel, where spectacular images are so important to help sell a destination (alongside, ahem, fantastic words). Personally, Instagram has given me work opportunities I wouldn’t have found elsewhere: I’ve been commissioned to write features based on the destinations I’ve tagged myself in via Instagram, although I’m still waiting for a blurry photo of a cityscape to be bought by a picture editor…That brings me on to my next point: Instagram is great for meeting new people and picking up tips. Often I’ve geotagged myself in a particular destination and locals have messaged me about some cool new restaurant, a must-visit tea shop, or even offered to meet up for a beer to show me around. A photo I posted of the rust-red National Museum of Cambodia last year prompted a friend to message and say she was in Phnom Penh at the same time – and did we want to grab a Khmer beer later?\u0026nbspThen there’s the inspiration side of Instagram. I once organised a bucket-list trip to Tanzania based on a photo so flat-out spectacular that I knew I’d have to see it for myself. A journalist I followed (in the days before influencers) had snapped a picture of herself in an infinity pool at a safari lodge in the Serengeti, overlooking a watering hole. And so two weeks of annual leave was booked around visiting that particular lodge. I didn’t get the same shot (or even want to) but watching elephants bathing in the water while lazing in a cool kidney pool was every bit as blockbuster as the Instagram snap promised. And really – how is booking a holiday based on an Instagram post any different from flicking through an analogue Thomas Cook catalogue?Travellers forget that Instagram is also practical, because it’s real-time information. The app holds a mine of data. How big are the queues at Anne Frank’s house in Amsterdam? Check Stories tagged at that location. What is the weather like for a weekend trip to Berlin – are people snapped in light jackets or thick coats? Is it currently bucketing it down in Hong Kong? All you have to do is check out a handful of the 95 million (ish) posts per day.Yes, unplugging from Instagram while on holiday might mean you notice how gorgeously rococo Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace is. But by snapping an Instagram of it, you’ve given yourself a memory to return to again and again. The world is better when we’re connected to it. And in this miserablist world, sometimes it just helps to have a nice picture to look at.Why we should all take a leaf out of Vienna’s book and unhashtag our livesGazing out over the picturesque expanse of Lisbon from my hotel’s rooftop bar, its pastel-shaded, higgledy-piggledy buildings interspersed with verdant trees, I try to take it all in. The sky, amber-hued as the sun sets the Tagus river and accompanying Ponte 25 de Abril, sparkling roguishly in the distance the storybook-perfect Castelo St Jorge, set high upon a hill in all its glory. I look and look and look – but I don’t reach for my smartphone.Yes, ladies and gentleman – I may be the only travel writer on the planet who doesn’t have Instagram. I’m not alone but I certainly seem to be in the minority friends and colleagues never fail to meet my app absenteeism with disbelief.“But you go to all those amazing places!” they say. “It’s such a waste!”My standard response is a curt, “I don’t like taking photos or looking at other people’s.” Which usually stumps them.They’re right in one respect. I do get the opportunity to visit some phenomenal spots – luxury hotels with infinity pools, white sand beaches lapped by cobalt waves, Michelin-starred restaurants with tasting menus so damn good I feel drunk on decadence. (Do you hate me yet?)Yat Sen Memorial ParkMuch of it is Insta-heaven, just begging to be caught, captioned and catapulted onto the internet’s favourite photo-sharing platform. But, while I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognition.And now there’s at least one place which won’t expect that of me, one place that actively discourages such behaviour despite the allegedly increasing influence of “Instagrammability” as a factor in people’s holiday choices.Vienna’s bold new tourism campaign, Unhashtag Vienna, is targeting the social media generation with a simple message – put down the smartphone and enjoy the moment instead. Signs reading “See Vienna, not #Vienna” are there to greet visitors at the airport and, for the month of November, the tourist information office on Albertinaplatz will be giving out instant cameras with just 10 shots. The aim is that tourists spend less time snapping and more time actually experiencing.While I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognitionIt might seem antagonistic to some but to me it’s plain refreshing. I salute Vienna for both their innovation and bravery in daring to suggest that perhaps there might be a better way to see a city than through a screen.Long before I became a travel writer I started to resent the impact smartphones had on travel – and on all activities, come to think of it. Dining with a friend and them only half listening while I shared my news, their attention far more invested in an ever-changing news feed going on trips where I had to repeatedly wait out of shot before I could sit down as colleagues secured the desired pic watching the sunset, my view marred by a hundred obtrusive, winking camera phones. I could go on.I’m not Amish. Of course I recognise that social media isn’t without its blessings and benefits. There’s just something about it that seems to suck all of our attention, vampire-like, in a deeply uncomfortable way. And there’s something about the aspirational quality of Instagram that sells us a dream – particularly when it comes to travel – filtering out the ugly, the uncomfortable or the just plain boring, until all that’s left are the bright and shiny parts. It kind of sets a place up to fail. How can the reality ever live up to the over-saturated promise? How can a “bucket-list destination” ever be more than a slight disappointment?Travel influencers also have a lot to answer for when it comes to promoting “bad behaviour” to get the money shot. Just this month, blogger and influencer Patricia, otherwise known as One Ocean Away, was called out for posting a picture of herself walking on railway tracks while a train travelled towards her – some said it could encourage others to emulate her in a more dangerous setting.Of course, all that’s only half the story. Truth time: what really freaks me out about Instagram is the idea of how closely tied my fragile ego would be to my travels.It would be nice to think that, when we post things on social media, it’s done merely for the pleasure of sharing our lives and connecting with others we just want to be part of that big, beautiful conversation.YangonIt would be nice – but it wouldn’t be true. For most of us, it’s the endorphin rush of seeing those numbers climb – follows, likes, shares, comments – that keeps us coming back for more. Whether we like it or not, we are all approval junkies for whom those figures are inherently bound up in our self-worth. In the era of the ubiquitous selfie, it seems inevitable to associate thousands of likes with the idea that thousands of people like you and, conversely, that a dearth of interactions means you’re essentially an online pariah.It happens on every platform, but Instagram is one of the worst offenders when it comes to making us feel our value can be measured numerically – particularly as statistics show that pictures with people in tend to perform better than those without. Ergo, people are judging you as much as they are the backdrop, whether it be Kyoto’s bamboo forest, Santorini’s blue-capped buildings or Singapore’s rooftop infinity pool.Blac Chyna under fire for promoting skin bleaching creamHailey Baldwin appears to confirm marriage to Justin BieberNick Jonas opens up about having diabetes in candid Instagram postTo be frank, I just don’t think I could hack it. I can already see how things would go – here’s me enjoying that Lisbon skyline. Here’s me honing the shot to find the best angle, filtering it so the buildings really pop, cropping out the messy table in front of me. Here’s me posting it. And, several hours later, here’s me checking it, and rechecking it, and rechecking it, ad infinitum, to see how many interactions I’ve had. I ignore the sweeping landscape before me I ignore the cocktail in my glass I even ignore the person sitting opposite me. I don’t need a crystal ball to see my inescapable Instagram future.Instead, free from such constraints, I’m able to live – not just in the moment, but in the place.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As James Moore\u0026nbspexplains, it wouldn’t be the first example of a team machinating its own demiseClick to followThe IndependentThe Raiders’ defeat by the San Francisco 49ers earlier this month triggered much adverse commentThe Raiders are officially tanking,” declared USA Today’s Touchdown Wire last month. It’s not the first time this has been suggested by those covering the NFL for a living in response to the\u0026nbspteam’s dismal season.The contention that there’s nothing accidental about the losing streak is based on the notion that a lowly position in the final NFL standings this season\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspsecure a favourable position in next year’s NFL draft. It allocates the first pick from each year’s pool of eligible players from the college game to the worst team, and then proceeds in reverse order, with the Super Bowl winner going last in each of seven rounds. Just over 250 rookies, many of considerable quality,\u0026nbspare selected in this manner.While no one from the team would admit it, and certainly not coach Jon Gruden\u0026nbsp(who indeed has flatly denied it), the suggestion that the Raiders are “tanking” was hard to dismiss\u0026nbspduring the 34-3 loss to the crosstown San Francisco 49ers at the start of November.Baseball players race to capture escaped ducklingsIt was a truly dreadful performance. Michael Wilbon, one of the hosts of ESPN’s talk show Pardon the Interruption, was moved to describe it as “the worst I’ve seen” from one of the league’s marque franchises.Having followed the Raiders for more than three decades, including through some very rough seasons, I couldn’t disagree.Gruden is the returning prodigal son, a man who\u0026nbspumpteen teams, both college and pro, had been trying to tempt back into the game from the broadcast booth.He was head coach during the construction of the last truly successful Raiders roster. That squad\u0026nbspwent to the Super Bowl in 2002, but ironically Gruden\u0026nbsphad by then been traded by the late Al Davis, the team’s mercurial owner, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And the Bucs won that game.Gruden got one of the rings traditionally handed to the winners, but critics sniffed that he did it with the team of his predecessor, Tony Dungy, who himself\u0026nbspwent on to win it all with the Indianapolis Colts.Bent upon moving the Raiders franchise to Las Vegas, Davis’s son and successor as team owner Mark needed to make a splash and create some excitement. He did it by re-signing\u0026nbspGruden\u0026nbspin January, courtesy of a reported 10-year, $100m deal that is unprecedented for an NFL coach. The package offered Gruden the chance to do things\u0026nbsphis way.With the sort of security no other NFL coach has, the man nicknamed “Chucky”, after the horror movie character,\u0026nbspfor his facial expressions during games\u0026nbsphas set about tearing apart a team that went 6-10 in 2018\u0026nbspbut had made the playoffs the previous year.Gruden during the NFL Football game between Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers in November (RexThurman James)Homegrown stars such as defensive wrecking ball Khalil Mack, one of the league’s best players, and the talented, if inconsistent, receiver Amari Cooper, were traded away for future draft picks, with the team fielding a combination of ageing castoffs and ultra green rookies this year.Mack wanted a monster extension, which he got from the Chicago Bears, his new home. Cooper, now with Dallas, would soon have been after a new deal of his own. Their departures, and other moves, have given the Raiders considerable head room under the NFL’s salary cap to spend in free agency. But this year’s team is a mess, and there were times when it looked like the players had quit on their coach during the Thursday night debacle in San Francisco. The Raiders made the 49ers rookie quarterback Nick Mullens, who had gone undrafted and had never started a game, look like 49er legend Joe Montana.Could the critics have been correct? Were the Raiders\u0026nbspthrowing away a season to make themselves competitive for their projected 2020 arrival in the city of sin?The idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples, perhaps the most infamous being the ‘Disgrace of\u0026nbspGijon’ in the 1982 football\u0026nbspWorld CupThe result of the trades is that the Raiders have not only accumulated spending money they also have an impressive five picks in the first round of the NFL draft over the next two years.The position of the Raiders’ traded future\u0026nbsppicks from the Dallas Cowboys and the Chicago Bears will be determined by the\u0026nbsprecords of the latter two teams. The better they do with the help of the Raiders players they have acquired, the worse the return to the Raiders will be (and the Bears look like a lock for the playoffs, with the Cowboys in with a decent shot).The Raiders’ own picks, however, will be determined by the team’s record, and after losing to the LA Chargers on 11 November\u0026nbspfollowing the 49ers debacle, they were in pole position for the top slot and a shot at another defensive wrecking ball, Nick Bosa, the Ohio State Buckeyes product, and brother of Chargers star Joey Bosa. He sits at the top of the draft boards of most experts.It’s hard to see Bosa being as good as Mack. It’s hard to see anyone being as good as Mack. But the advantage with Bosa is that he will be stuck on a relatively cheap, league-mandated rookie deal for four years, with an optional fifth.If Bosa is the man the Raiders are after, it’s easy to see how they could win by losing.There was a similar case a few years ago, when quarterback Andrew Luck was coming out of Stanford, and was seen as an even more desirable commodity – a can’t-be-missed quarterback. A team prepared to “suck for Luck”\u0026nbspwould, it was said, be set for years. The Colts won that derby, and jettisoned legend Peyton Manning as a result. Luck has been decidedly unlucky with injury, but he has looked incredible this year, and easily worth the pain of the two-win, 14-loss\u0026nbspseason the Colts endured before getting him.Created with Sketch.The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the Year121 The 20 contenders for 2018 Sports Personality of the YearThe idea of winning by losing is hardly unique to the NFL. World sport is peppered with examples. Perhaps the most infamous in what Europeans call football was the “Disgrace of Gijon” in the 1982 World Cup.Having played all its group games, Algeria had four points (at the time it was two for a win). Two of them came from the shock of the tournament when the north African side beat West Germany 2-1, the other two from a 3-2 victory over Chile. The intervening game was a 2-0 loss to Austria. With West Germany having thrashed Chile, a complex situation was created ahead of the final game between the Germans and\u0026nbspAustria. The upshot was that they could both qualify and prevent Algeria from becoming the first African side to reach the knockout stages if the Germans won by either one or two goals (a third would push Austria out).After a 10-minute barrage Horst Hrubesch found the back of the net for West Germany. The rest of the game was a depressing spectacle, with lots of passing taking place in the two teams’ own halves, and an almost complete lack of any effort to find a goal. The crowd cried foul. Actually, they cried “fix”!Both teams denied collusion and Fifa considered no rules to have been broken, but from the 1986 World Cup onwards the final pair of group matches has kicked off at the same time with the aim of preventing a repeat.Hrubesch celebrates scoring in West Germany’s controversial 1982 win against\u0026nbspAustria\u0026nbsp(RexColorsport)Cricket is a sport in which accusations of match-fixing regularly crop up, mostly as a result of players allegedly manipulating the outcome of games (or specific in-game elements) to the benefit of gambling syndicates.But teams have been known to do it for their own advantage too. The most notorious incident of this type came when Somerset captain Brian Rose declared his side’s\u0026nbspinnings closed after just six balls during a match in the early\u0026nbspstages of the one-day format\u0026nbspBenson \u0026amp Hedges Cup of 1979. Rose had worked out that his team would qualify for the second round from their group as long as they weren’t overtaken on strike rate, which was the formula in use for splitting teams at the time (it has since been replaced by net run rate)\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspirrespective of the result of the specific match.Unfortunately for the county, the game’s administrators intervened, calling an emergency meeting that led to Somerset’s expulsion. The rules of the game were subsequently changed to prevent declarations in one-day games.It isn’t just at the top level that the sort of shenanigans deemed “just not cricket”\u0026nbspoccur either. The supposedly genteel world of village cricket has seen it too, and in more recent times. Last year Carew Cricket Club made headlines nationally after declaring at 18-1 during their Pembroke County Cricket Club title-decider against second-placed Cresselly. They were 21 points clear, with 20 available for a win. But their opponents could potentially make up the gap through batting and bowling bonus points if they were to win handsomely.Man beaten to death in baseball bat attack‘10 out of 10’ drunk smashed guitar over sleeping mamba user’s headTo prevent this from happening, Carew closed its innings early, losing the game but winning the title by ensuring no bonus points could be scored. A Twitter storm ensued\u0026nbspand a disciplinary panel was set up, leading to Carew’s relegation to a lower ision, a fine and a ban for the team’s captain. But Carew kept the title. So they could still be said to have won by losing.In addition to the potential of securing an advantageous draft position –\u0026nbspand all the big four US sports of American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey operate a variation on the draft theme –\u0026nbspit’s the absence of any\u0026nbspthreat of relegation that facilitates throwing away not just a game but the entire season in US sports. At least in theory.It might seem extreme to do it, but if you’re not a top-of-the-table contender\u0026nbspthere’s nothing to lose and everything to gain for a “rebuilding”\u0026nbspoperation. It’s more or less accepted practice in baseball\u0026nbsp(where around half the professional teams are essentially building for the future)\u0026nbspto throw in the towel come the end of July, at which time Major League Baseball imposes a trade deadline.The truth is that losing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players doTeams with no chance of making the end-of-year playoffs regularly swap their stars for prospects from contenders’ minor league “farm”\u0026nbspsystems. The Boston Red Sox got a pitching ace (Chris Sale) from the Chicago White Sox for four prospects in 2017, and a closer, Craig Kimbrel, from the San Diego Padres for another four in 2016. Those two were important parts of the team’s world series run this year. No one’s complaining about what the Red Sox gave up in return. Meanwhile the Padres lost 96 of their 162 games and the White Sox 100. The problem with “tanking”\u0026nbspfor tomorrow is that tomorrow doesn’t always arrive. It doesn’t matter how many prospects you accumulate if they don’t work out.The NFL draft is no more certain to improve your team than baseball prospects are. It’s a crapshoot, and although some are better than others at finding hits, Gruden’s record at Tampa wasn’t great.There is, however, a postscript to the story. The Raiders found themselves in Phoenix, Arizona on Sunday 18 November, facing the Cardinals, another struggling team in rebuilding\u0026nbspmode and with no chance of making the playoffs. Gruden’s men won a thriller courtesy of a field goal in the last second\u0026nbspthat was set up by a drive engineered by quarterback Derek Carr. Such comebacks were a hallmark of his during the 2016 playoff run.In so doing, the Raiders arguably hurt themselves, dropping from first to third in the notional draft order.\u0026nbspThey lost by winning. One headline writer said they were even managing to screw up tanking.But the truth is that\u0026nbsplosing is anathema to professional athletes, particularly those who put their bodies on the line like American football players do. The\u0026nbspraucous celebrations in the visitors’ locker room after the game showed how much victory meant. The members of the Raider nation who made their way out into the desert to watch were similarly delighted. Gruden looked pretty happy too.As the late, great Al Davis said: “Just win, baby.”\u0026nbspBecause winning’s much more fun.Still, the season isn’t over. And the road ahead will be a rocky one. The Raiders proved that by getting blown out by the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday. The remaining schedule sees the team facing the potentially Super Bowl-bound Kansas City Chiefs (twice), the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Denver Broncos in the weeks to come.It isn’t hard to see them losing the lot\u0026nbspand still having a very realistic shot at that first pick in next season’s draft. The tank\u0026nbspis still more or less on track.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang.

But by the time he achieved that year’s stunning double-punch of Jurassic Park and Schindler’s List –\u0026nbspthe latter of which had its world premiere 25 years ago this week – the director was already Hollywood’s undisputed miracle-worker, operating at a level far beyond even his most acclaimed contemporaries.Perhaps that’s why the audacity he demonstrated filming and releasing two wildly different, equally boundary-breaking blockbusters within 12 months of each other passed almost without mention. He had carried off the apparently impossible – and the world considered it more or less banal.\u0026nbspJurassic Park has long been considered both a popcorn classic and towering feat of filmmaking. The dinosaur romp to rule them all ushered in a new era of computer-generated effects. Loud, dazzling, occasionally terrifying, it is arguably second only to Jaws in the countdown of Spielberg’s great thrill rides.\u0026nbspBut as it marks its quarter century, Schindler’s List surely stands as the more impressive achievement. It respectfully honours the victims of the Nazi genocide, yet is also a riveting drama, with Ralph Fiennes, as real-life concentration camp commander Amon Goth, one of the most skin-crawling villains in recent cinematic history.\u0026nbspThe Holocaust movie had been Spielberg’s ultimate grail for decades. It was all the way back in 1982 that he was first alerted to the true life story of Oskar Schindler, the gadabout Moravian industrialist who, during the Second World War, saved the lives of an estimated 1,200 Jews in Nazi-occupied Krakow by putting them to work in his factories.Yet Spielberg fretted for years that he was too flashy – too much a creature of Hollywood – to do justice to a real story about real suffering. Only after turning 40 and enduring relative failures such as The Color Purple and Hook – the lukewarm reviews of which cracked his wunderkind reputation – did he feel at last prepared to tackle the greatest challenge of his professional life.\u0026nbspDern and Sam Neill in ‘Jurassic Park’ (Rex)Jewishness was complicated for Spielberg. He was raised by Orthodox parents in Phoenix, Arizona. But growing up “ethnic” in the American sun belt in the Fifties and Sixties was not straightforward, as he was reminded on a daily basis.\u0026nbsp“People coughed the word ‘Jew’ in their hand as they passed me in the hallway,” he told The New York Times. “Pennies were thrown at me in the study hall in a very quiet room of 100 students ... We couldn’t stop it. So my mom picked me up in her car every day after school and took me home.”He was very familiar with the Holocaust throughout his childhood. “We lost cousins, aunts, uncles ... My life has always come back to images surrounding the Holocaust,” he would recount. “The Holocaust had been part of my life, just based on what my parents would say at the dinner table.”\u0026nbspSchindler’s List’s journey to the screen was long and tortuous. The original Thomas Keneally nonfiction book, Schindler’s Ark, was inspired by a chance conversation the author had in 1980 with the owner of a leather goods shop in Los Angeles.Leopold Page’s real name was Poldek Pfefferberg: he was one of the “Schindler Jews” saved by Oskar Schindler. Upon discovering Keneally was a writer, Page insisted on sharing the entire tale – “the greatest story of humanity man to man”.\u0026nbspKeneally was hooked and, working initially from documents furnished by Page, assembled his eventual bestseller. But when Hollywood sought to option Schindler’s Ark it ran into problems. Page had been attempting to turn a spotlight on his saviour for decades and, in the Sixties, sold the rights to his version of events to MGM producer Marvin Gosch for $50,000.\u0026nbspThat project eventually sputtered out, but not before Gosch had hired Casablanca co-writer Howard Koch to write a script and interview Schindler Jews around LA. Spielberg, for his part, was alerted to Schindler’s Ark as he was toiling on ET. His mentor Sidney J Sheinberg, then president of MCA, gave him a copy of the Keneally tome. “It’ll make a helluva story,” Spielberg supposedly responded. “Is it true?”Neeson in ‘Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Reluctant to bring Schindler to the screen himself, Spielberg instead touted the idea to his old movie-making pals. Roman Polanksi and Brian De Palma said no, but Martin Scorsese expressed an interest and was eventually attached to direct. Then, surrounded by pirates and clockwork crocodiles on the set of Hook, Spielberg had an epiphany.He had, he believed, matured sufficiently as a filmmaker and was ready to adapt Schindler’s Ark. Indeed, it was arguably the undertaking towards which his entire career had been leading. All he had to do was win back the rights from one of the greatest directors of his generation.\u0026nbspAcross town at the Beverly Hills HQ, home to the almighty CAA agency, a Holocaust biopic was the last thing on the agenda. CAA’s co-founder Michael Ovitz, however, had a dilemma he would have regarded as no less pressing than Spielberg’s desire to wrest back ownership of Schindler’s List. How could he persuade Steven Spielberg, Hollywood’s most unassailable hit-maker, to sign with him?\u0026nbspHe had an idea – and it hinged on proposition his old friend Michael Crichton had brought to CAA. Ovitz and Crichton were close, the agent having shielded the author and director from prurient attention when he went through two years of devastating depression. Now Crichton was gung-ho about a new concept for a novel – to be set in a theme park where genetically engineered dinosaurs go on the rampage.\u0026nbspHow Jeff Goldblum stole the first Jurassic ParkSpielberg beat James Cameron to Jurassic Park film rights by hoursIt would, Ovitz immediately appreciated, make for a cracking read – and an even better movie. And who better to direct that the doyen of rip-roaring family entertainment, Steven Spielberg? He wasn’t representing Spielberg – who famously did not have an agent at that time. But with a little persuasion, Ovitz hoped to remedy the situation and have Spielberg both make the movie and sign with CAA. Thus Ovitz would have landed the biggest fish in Hollywood.\u0026nbsp“We offered Jurassic Park exclusively to Steven Spielberg – who still hadn’t signed with CAA,” Ovitz writes in his autobiography, Who is Michael Ovitz?. “Steven was the one director Michael and I knew who possessed both the technique and the sense of wonder to pull the plot off. Playing favourites on this one would alienate a lot of our other filmmakers, but it was worth it.”Spielberg blazed through the (still unpublished) novel in a single evening and, for the first time in his career, attached himself to a picture that was unfinanced and had yet to receive a studio green light. At that moment, the only people in on Jurassic Park were Crichton, Ovitz, Spielberg and his producing partner Kathleen Kennedy (today, dark lord of Disney’s Star Wars franchise).\u0026nbspOvitz next called Sheinberg – the very mogul who had introduced Spielberg to Schindler’s Ark a decade previously. He explained to the producer, now honcho-in-chief at Universal, that he had “good news and bad news”.In any other industry, the scenario would have seemed farcical. In Hollywood, it was business as usual. Spielberg wanted to make Schindler’s List but Scorsese held the rights. Sheinberg, who had turned Spielberg onto Schindler’s List, wanted to make Jurassic Park – but Spielberg and his collaborators had it in their back pocket. Meanwhile, Spielberg was attached to a mooted remake of the 1962 Robert MitchumGregory Peck thriller Cape Fear – a project he was keen to pass on to Scorsese, despite his old pal’s strict “no-remakes” rule.\u0026nbspScorsese\u0026nbspinto swapping ‘Schindler’s List’ for ‘Cape Fear’ (Rex)This being Hollywood, a solution beneficial to all parties was hammered out. Spielberg talked Scorsese into swapping Schindler’s List for Cape Fear – the carrot being that he could cast Robert De Niro as the villain played in the original by Mitchum and thus reunite with his favourite actor. Meanwhile, Universal agreed a complicated profit share with Ovitz, Spielberg and Crichton. They would walk away with nothing if Jurassic Park flopped – but enjoy a lucrative slice of the box office should it do well.\u0026nbspSheinberg also agreed to let Spielberg adapt Schindler’s Ark, even assenting to a three-hour running time, black and white photography and a comparatively hefty £23m\u0026nbspbudget. There was a\u0026nbspcaveat, though – he had to do Jurassic Park first.\u0026nbspAs 1992 began, Spielberg was thus juggling two remarkably different undertakings. He’d decided to forgo a fee for Schindler’s List. Payment for telling the story of the Holocaust would, he felt, be tantamount to “blood money”.\u0026nbspHe also had to find his Schindler, and rejected pressure to cast a star (Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson both auditioned). Warren Beatty talked his way into a script reading – but was ultimately rejected because, according to Spielberg, he would have ended up with Oskar Schindler-as-Warren Beatty rather than the other way around. In the end, he went with the comparatively unknown Liam Neeson, who had impressed Spielberg in a Eugene O’Neill play on Broadway.An even bigger headache was bringing realistic dinosaurs to the screen. Spielberg had assumed early on that Jurassic would utilise “go motion” – an updating of the ancient “stop motion” effects as featured in King Kong and immortalised in the Fifties and Sixties by the “creature features” of Ray Harryhausen.\u0026nbspThe creator of “go-motion” Phil Tippett – celebrated in Hollywood for creating the Imperial Walkers in The Empire Strikes Back – was hired and test sequences of the famous T rex and velociraptors-in-the-kitchen scenes were shot. Spielberg’s children were entranced when he showed them the footage. Yet something nagged at the director. King Kong was 60 years old. Surely technology had moved on?\u0026nbspEnter Industrial Light and Magic, which presented Spielberg with a primitive CGI showreel of a walking T rex. Even in rough form, it was many times more realistic than go-motion. Spielberg turned to Tippett and quipped:\u0026nbsp“You’re out of job.”\u0026nbsp“Don’t you mean extinct?” Tippet shot back – a line Spielberg put in the script (Tippett stayed on as “dinosaur supervisor”).Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Filming on Jurassic Park had wrapped but special effects were still unfinished when Spielberg arrived in Krakow in March 1993 for the 72-day Schindler’s List shoot. He had put himself under time pressure because he wanted to make the Holocaust movie in the bleak Polish spring. He could, it is true, have waited another year. But he feared that if he delayed (and especially if Jurassic Park flopped), the studio would reconsider bankrolling his passion project.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List was intensely personal for the director –\u0026nbsptraumatic simply by dint of the subject matter. Day after day, he would recreate the horrors of the Krakow ghetto and of the nearby Płaszow concentration camp, presided over by monstrous SS second lieutenant Goth (Fiennes’s mere presence in a Nazi uniform is said to have reduced Holocaust survivors to tears on visits to the set).\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspat night\u0026nbspSpielberg would communicate via satellite uplink with Industrial Light and Magic in San Francisco. Here, he was required to make final decisions over how the T rex ought to roar and whether a brachiosaurus should rise on its back legs when eating. It was difficult and depressing – and Spielberg grew to resent Hollywood for putting him through the mill in such a fashion.\u0026nbsp“When I finally started shooting ... in Poland, I had to go home about two or three times a week and get on a very crude satellite feed to northern California ... to be able to approve T rex shots,” he remembered at an anniversary screening of Schindler’s List at Tribeca Film Festival.\u0026nbspOne of his methods of coping was to call Robin Williams, whom he had befriended making Hook. Never one to refuse an audience, Williams took it as his mission to cajole Spielberg out of his blue moods.\u0026nbsp“Robin knew what I was going through, and once a week, Robin would call me on schedule and he would do 15 minutes of standup on the phone,” Spielberg said. “I would laugh hysterically, because I had to release so much.”Neeson (Rex)With laughter and determination, he got through it and achieved one of the remarkable one-twos in film. Released on 11 June 1993, Jurassic Park became the monster that devoured the box office whole, earning nearly $1bn. Of that, Spielberg pocketed an estimated $250m\u0026nbspthanks to the deal Ovitz had thrashed out in pre-production.\u0026nbspAnd then, on 15 December, Schindler’s List opened in US cinemas, revealing a very different side to Hollywood’s great conjurer. (It would open in the UK in early 1994.)\u0026nbspThe movie was powerful, haunting and lacking the trademark sentimentality that Spielberg for so long feared made him temperamentally ill-suited to directing it.\u0026nbspBoth films were universally adored. The New York Times praised Jurassic Park as\u0026nbsp“a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen”. The Independent approved, too: “The best thing about Jurassic Park is the way that fear never drives out wonder, wonder at the special effects that have realised dinosaurs so convincingly, but also at the dinosaurs in their own right,” it said.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List received an even more positive response. “Schindler’s List, with its grave documentary thoroughness and moral complexity, rewrites film history,” said The Independent. “It is one of the cinema’s finest achievements.” “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again,” added The New York Times.\u0026nbspJurassic Park and Schindler’s List went on to clean up at the Oscars the following year. Jurassic Park won for best sound editing, sound mixing and special effects. But this was eclipsed by Schindler’s List, which finally lifted the Academy Awards curse that had hung over Spielberg since ET was trumped by Gandhi a decade previously.\u0026nbspAmong the seven Oscars awarded to it were ones for Best Film and Best Director. Yet far from exulting, James Cameron-style, in his sweep, Spielberg cut a sober figure. The presence beside him on the podium of producer Branko Lustig – who as a child had spent two years at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen – was a reminder there were more important things than accolades and ovations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Claiming that it will hurt families of already meagre living standards, he suggested that the policy could be similarly damaging to Theresa May as Poll Tax was to Margaret ThatcherLiberal Democrat peer Lord Scriven said Home Office officials were in some cases\u0026nbspstating that applicants were\u0026nbspnot LGBT+\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspmerely to justify a refusal in order\u0026nbspto meet the requirements of their ministers – something he said\u0026nbspshould never be allowed to happen.\u0026nbspHe added: The Home Office may have good policy on paper, but it is clear the practice is both humiliating and completely unacceptable. This process sees too many LGBT+ applicants ordered back to countries where they are at risk of persecution or in some cases death.\u0026nbspMany iniduals who I speak to seeking asylum on the grounds of their sexuality or gender identity are in disbelief how they are treated by the Home Office.\u0026nbspI urge the Conservative government to establish a dedicated unit to handle asylum applications, outside the Home Office and free of political interference. These inhumane and degrading practices must come to an end immediately.”Leila\u0026nbspZadeh, executive director of UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration group (UKLGIG), said the decline was “extremely worrying”.\u0026nbspShe added:\u0026nbsp“Our research has shown that the Home Office routinely disbelieves\u0026nbspLGBTQI+ asylum claimants and disregard statements from friends, partners and organisations testifying to a claimant\u0027s sexual orientation or gender identity.\u0026nbspThe Home Office is setting the bar too high for\u0026nbspLGBTQI+ people. They are not applying the correct legal standard of proof that it is \u0027reasonably likely\u0027 that someone will be persecuted. It is imperative that the Home Secretary agrees to an independent public audit into asylum decision-making.”This is what LGBTQI+ people go through to gain asylum in the UKThe latest figures come\u0026nbspafter the government announced in July that it was going to review its guidance for caseworkers on processing asylum claims on the basis of sexual orientation – but ministers\u0026nbspoffered no details as to when and how this would be carried out.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“This government is committed to an immigration system which is fair and humane and this includes being supportive and responsive to those claiming asylum on the basis of their sexual orientation.\u0026nbspAll asylum claims lodged in the UK, including those on the grounds of sexual orientation, are carefully considered on their inidual merits. Decision-makers are given dedicated training and guidance on how to handle such claims.“No one who is found to be at risk of persecution or serious harm in their country of origin because of their sexuality will be returned.”Asylum and ImmigrationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

I’ve worked out that you could plan and hold a referendum in 22 weeks. “My\u0026nbspcalculations show that we could get through the work of passing legislation, we could get through the work of the Electoral Commission working out the right question... we could do that in 22 weeks. “We could actually, after this vote on 11 December, hold a referendum, potentially, on 30 May\u0026nbspnext year.“We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article 50, I’ve suggested, by four months to 29 July.”How an EEAEFTA Brexit model would solve Theresa May’s problemsWhy Nick Boles’ Norway model for Brexit is no plan B at allBBC reveals date for live Theresa May-Jeremy Corbyn Brexit TV debateMark Carney defends Bank of England over ‘Project Hysteria’ claimsNo-deal Brexit will damage security in Britain, minister to sayThe EU has been clear that “if Britain needs a few more months to resolve the route forward, we would be able to have that”, she said.Ms Greening said it was not “heresy” to delay Brexit, adding: “Given this decision is going to shape the coming decades, I think we owe it to ourselves and to future generations to get it right.”Her comments came at a People’s Vote event, where former Tory ministers Jo Johnson and Lord Willetts spoke in favour of the “Conservative case” for a new referendum.Mr Johnson, who\u0026nbspresigned in protest at Ms May’s Brexit plans, warned that the Tories could lose all credibility if they pursue the prime minister’s plan, and clear the way for a Labour victory at the next election.He said: “Brexit is seen as a project driven by the Conservative Party and this half-baked worst of all words Brexit could trigger an electoral defeat on the scale of 1997 or worse, this ‘Tory Brexit’ label will be an albatross around our necks for years to come.”Mr Johnson said he even agreed with Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, and his own brother Boris Johnson, that the prime minister’s plan would leave the UK as a “passive recipient” of EU policy.It comes after EU leaders endorsed the prime minister’s blueprint at the weekend, clearing the way for a Commons showdown on 11 December, where scores of Tory MPs\u0026nbspare expected to vote down the deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchWith Labour and the other opposition parties also opposed, shadow chancellor John McDonnell gave his strongest hint yet that Labour would\u0026nbspback a second referendum, saying it could be “inevitable” unless there is a general election.However Ms May\u0026nbsptold a committee of senior MPs on Thursday that seeking an extension to the\u0026nbspwithdrawal process\u0026nbspwould cause the agreement would fall apart.“Any second referendum that would be held, if that were the case, would not be able to be held by 29 March next year. You would have to extend Article 50,” she told the Commons Liaison Committee.“What is clear is that any extension to Article 50 – anything like that – reopens the negotiations, reopens the deal.

We have been discussing debate formats with both parties and will announce further details soon.”The BBC One schedule on the Sunday carries hits such as Doctor Who, the Strictly Come Dancing results show and Sir David Attenborough’s new series, Dynasties.If the debate aired straight after the Strictly semi-final results show, it could be boosted by the 9.6 million viewers already watching the channel.Verhofstadt predictsAn hour-long 8pm slot would also avoid a clash with the I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! final, which airs at 9pm on ITV.But it was in part the broadcasting of the reality TV show that led Mr Corbyn to say he backed the commercial channel’s proposal.“It reaches a wider audience and the timing looked good to me because it’s not inconveniencing people who want to watch other things later in the evening.“One should always have respect for the viewers and also we want to get the widest possible audience.”Rik Mayall portrayal of politician from the late 1980s foresees Brexit rhetoricThe Labour leader’s team is also said to be more keen on the ITV version because of the format, with BBC apparently suggesting the head-to-head debate could be coupled with a separate panel of interested parties who would get to ask questions of the leaders.The ITV version meanwhile is said to be a cleaner, straight debate between Ms May and Mr Corbyn, with no one else involved.Downing Street and the leader of the opposition’s office are believed to have sat down with the four main broadcasters to hear their pitches before deciding on who to go with.Number 10’s preference is said to have been the BBC, as it was the most “rounded” and focused on the prime minister’s deal, not the wider political situation.The BBC had initially suggested the debate would take place on Thursday 6 December. But after Mr Corbyn’s office expressed a preference to go with ITV’s offer of a Sunday night broadcast, it offered to switch to Sunday as well.Downing Street was reportedly happy to go with that option, and it is now waiting for Labour to say whether it is willing to proceed. ITV said it has not ruled out holding its own debate.A spokeswoman said in a statement: “ITV will confirm its coverage plans for the week of the Commons vote in due course. As part of this, ITV has invited the prime minister and leader of the opposition to appear in an ITV programme. As always, it is up to those invited to decide whether they want to accept the invitation.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The departure of the UK from the European Union is a failure for everybody, for the UK, as for the EU.“Last Sunday was a sad day for both. So let us make the best of it, in the knowledge that once, in the near future there will be a new generation in Britain who will decide to come back into the great European family.”Polls and studies suggest that young people were significantly more likely to vote Remain than the older generation.Other senior MEPs speaking during the debate backed the deal. Elmar Brok, a German MEP from Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, warned Remainers in the UK that they would be taking a risk by rejecting the plan.Consumer confidence slumps to lowest level in a year due to Brexit No-deal Brexit will damage security in Britain, minister to sayGrim GDP forecasts as Corbyn ally says new Brexit vote ‘inevitable’“If there is no treaty then there will be no transitional period and it’s going to be an abrupt break,” he said.“It must be made clear that it is a very risky initiative for the Remainers, rejecting this and hoping something else is going to come, like a referendum – that’s a very risky business.”He added that the EU had “got the best deal possible”, adding: “Brexit is a very bad affair for the European Union and Great Britain – more for Great Britain, given its size, but it’s also a very bad thing for us as well.”Philippe Lamberts, a Green MEP who sits on the parliament’s Brexit steering group, said “no other Brexit is available” and that a no-deal Brexit would “make the UK a rogue state, a country whose signature with any other partner would amount to just nothing”.“The real choice is between Brexit under the terms negotiated and no Brexit at all,” he said, adding that the EU should allow Britain to stay in if it wanted to.Farage said negotiations were ‘game, set, and match’ to Michel Barnier (EbS)Former Ukip\u0026nbspleader Nigel Farage said: “I’m in no doubt that this withdrawal agreement is a good deal … it’s a good deal for the European Union. For the UK I think it’s probably the worst deal in history.“Mr Barnier, I have to say to you: I wish you were on our side, really. Because it’s game set and match to you. You probably can’t even believe your luck that you came up against a British prime minister who met every single demand of yours while at the same time trying to deceive the British public.”Mr Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, echoed his message from Sunday’s European Council summit to MEPs.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The increase in arrears per claimant averaged £586 for the 2016 group and £309 for the 2017 group.“The evidence shows that, even 15\u0026nbspmonths after claiming universal credit, those affected were consistently underpaying rent due,”\u0026nbspthe report says.“For now, the government must acknowledge that the current system is unworkable and broken. We strongly argue that the rollout of UC should be halted until radical steps are taken to fix the ongoing issues outlined in this research,” it states.Councillor Victoria Mills, a cabinet member at Southwark Council, said: “It is a disgrace that the government’s flagship benefit reform is leaving residents waiting for money to pay for the roof over their head and that huge numbers of residents are dependent on charity for food.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves hit the British coast as Storm Diana approaches, in Portreath, CornwallDuke and Duchess of Cambridge stand with Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (left), the son of Leicester City\u0027s chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and his mother Aimon watched by Leicester City players (right) as they pause after laying flowers during their visit to the King Power Stadium in Leicester, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the October 27 helicopter crash at the stadium.

We have to act on this evidence now and look at how we can support our residents and the pressure on our services.

And he weighs roughly 2,800 pounds, which is the approximate equivalent of 14-and-a-half Danny DeVitos.Animal-rights protesters play cow slaughter sound to steakhouse dinersMore animals to be destroyed after mad cow disease found on farmCows fed seaweed in bid to tackle climate changeWhich is to say, Knickers is big. But also that his bigness is relative to what he is being compared to.“This story needs some perspective,” said Aniek Bouwman, an expert in animal breeding and genomics at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.For starters, she said, it’s important to note that Knickers is not a cow but a steer, because males are typically quite a bit larger than females. (Note: Only females who have had at least one calf are referred to in cattle circles as “cows”.) But his breed is also important, Ms\u0026nbspBouwman said.Male Holsteins tend to top out at just under 6 feet in height, while other breeds, like the wagyu cattle that surround Knickers in the now-famous photos of him, usually come in under 4.5 feet.In other words, Knickers is a large specimen, but he looks larger because he’s standing among a herd of Danny DeVitos, not a herd of Arnold Schwarzeneggers.Age is also a factor. Knickers is seven years old, which is actually rather long in the tooth for a steer. The animals he was pictured with are all around one year old, his owner told the New York Times.“Steers are usually destined for slaughter by the age of three,” said Craig Hickman, a dairy farmer in Ashburton, New Zealand, who added that nearly everyone he knows has been sending him reports about Knickers. “So at seven he’s had time to pack on an awful lot of weight.”In fact, Knickers’ extreme proportions may have been something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. After a few years of growth, the animal had become too large to put through a processing facility, according to his owner, Geoff Pearson.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A child waits to receive free bread by a local charity bakery amid a severe shortage of food in Sana\u0027a, Yemen.

A Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph, was the most powerful storm ever to hit the Florida PanhandleAge and breed aside, Knickers does seem to have something a little extra going on. Which is interesting, Mr Pearson said in an interview, because the steer’s parents weren’t particularly large, nor was he noticeably different at birth.“He was just a run-of-the-mill calf that’s turned into a giant,” said Mr Pearson, who owns a third-generation cattle farm in Myalup, a small town in Western Australia.According to Ms\u0026nbspBouwman, both gigantism and dwarfism, or exceptionally large and small iniduals, have been documented in various species. She published a meta-analysis study in Nature this year that suggested that the same genes regulate size across cattle, dogs and humans, which means that it may well be possible for Knickers-like extremes to occur in any mammal under the right conditions.As for whether genes are responsible for Knickers’ size, Ms\u0026nbspBouwman said a DNA test would be required to say for sure.It may also be possible that Knickers’ pituitary gland, which regulates growth, has gone haywire. This has been seen in some tadpole specimens that continue to grow as tadpoles and never undergo metamorphosis to become frogs.Asked about Knickers, Richard Wassersug, an honorary professor and herpetologist at the University of British Columbia who studies giantism in tadpoles, said he wouldn’t want to speculate outside of his realm of expertise. But generally speaking, he said, no growth can go on forever.“There are clear limits on how large any terrestrial organism can be before its organ systems can no longer meet the collective needs of other organ systems and they start to fail,” he said.Danniel, another humongous Holstein in California that was roughly the same size as Knickers, died this year from a calcium deficiency. According to news reports, Danniel consumed 100 pounds of hay, 15 pounds of grain and 100 gallons of water a day. He’d lived to be eight years old.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Waves hit the British coast as Storm Diana approaches, in Portreath, CornwallDuke and Duchess of Cambridge stand with Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (left), the son of Leicester City\u0027s chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and his mother Aimon watched by Leicester City players (right) as they pause after laying flowers during their visit to the King Power Stadium in Leicester, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the October 27 helicopter crash at the stadium.

Despite their huge range, the waves were apparently not felt by anybody. However, one person monitoring the US Geological Survey’s live stream of seismogram displays did notice the unusual waveform and posted it to Twitter, sparking the interest of other geologists and earthquake enthusiasts.Volcano of Fire eruption sends boiling rock flying almost two milesTwitter user @matarikipax posted the waveforms, describing it in the first instance as “a most odd and unusual seismic signal”.It was not only the power of the seismic waves which puzzled scientists when they began to examine the readings, but also the curiously regular shape of the waveform.In a typical earthquake, the rapid crash of a tectonic plate movement sends out what is known as a “wave train”, composed of several types of waves moving at different speeds from the epicentre of the quake.Seismographs measure the fastest waves first (the primary or P waves), which arrive in an abrupt cluster, then the secondary (S waves), and finally, rumbling along later, come slower low-frequency surface waves. In a powerful quake, these can move across the surface of the planet several times.The wave pattern seen on 11 November resembled these slow-moving waveforms usually seen following large earthquakes - only, in this case,\u0026nbspthere had not been a perceptible earthquake.At least 700 people injured after 6.3-magnitude hits western IranUnderwater tremor was most powerful earthquake to strike NorwayFracking earthquake laws could be relaxed to encourage drillingThe bizarre waveform is what scientists call “monochromatic”. Earthquakes normally produce waves of so many different frequencies, the wave readings appear more jumbled.But the mystery waveform from Mayotte was a crisp zigzag, which repeated after steady 17-second intervals.“They\u0027re too nice. They\u0027re too perfect to be nature,” joked the University of Glasgow’s Helen Robinson, who is study for a PhD in applied volcanology.Speaking to the National Geographic, she added the location of the island means industrial sources for the unusual wave - such as oil drilling or from wind farms -\u0026nbspcould be ruled out. Founder of UK Earthquake Bulletin (UKEQ) Jamie Gurney, who was among those who began looking at the waveform, saying\u0026nbspon Twitter he had “no idea if a similar global signal of this nature has ever been observed”.So what could cause these regular slow waves? Could it have been a meteor strike? An illegal weapons test? Previously undiscovered sea monsters? Mayotte lies between Tanzania and Madagascar (Google)Despite the mystery, scientists do have clues as to the cause of the seismic event. Mayotte, an inhabited French island, was formed as a result of volcanic eruptions around 4,000 years ago, but since then, the area has largely remained volcanically inactive.However, since May last year, the island nation has been rocked by hundreds of earthquakes, all of which have emanated offshore and the largest of which measured 5.8 on the Richter scale. The island is believed to be moving about two inches southeast each year.But in recent months, seismic activity has declined, and on the 11 November, no traditional quakes were detected. According to the National Geographic, analysis by the French Geological Survey suggests the new activity may point to huge movements of magma beneath the earth’s crust, miles offshore and under thousands of feet of water.Large movements of liquid rock, or reverberations through the magma chamber can cause waves similar to those measured in this instance.GPS measurements of Mayotte’s slow movements indicate a magma body measuring about a third of a cubic mile is pushing through the subsurface, and this could be the source of the weird waves.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Firefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004441473882.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mps support second eu referendum brexit vote","story":"While some have backed the call in some cases it is not clear whether or not those MPs want another referendum over membership of the EU or want a public say on the deal being offered by May.We take a look at some of the key figures who have supported a second referendum.Jo Johnson resigned as rail minister and demanded a second referendum.Boris Johnsons brother said the deal was substantially worse than staying in the EU, and it was imperative we go back to the people and check they still want to leave.Jo Johnsons resignation came just months after his own brother Boris quit as Foreign Secretary - saying he couldnt back Mrs Mays plans any longer.His decision to resign came after the failure of Brexit negotiations to achieve what had been promised.Justine Greening said she believes there are other Conservative MPs who also support the idea of a second referendum - after she became the most high-profile Tory to endorse it.The former education and transport secretary  said Theresa May’s Chequers plan “in practice suits no one”.She said that a new referendum would provide “a route forwards”.She added:“only solution is to take the final Brexit decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians.“I think what I’m saying is what everyone is seeing in parliament.She told : “The promise was that we would have a deal about our future trading relationship with the European Union. Everything would be settled. But we’re not going to get a deal.We’re going to get a withdrawal agreement and our future trading relationship will not be determined until after we’ve left the European Union.That is not what the British people were promised that is not what they voted for. It is the most terrible betrayal.When the history books are written on this period, it will reflect exceedingly badly on an awful lot of people, who have put their heads in the sand and allowed this terrible mistake to take place.”The Conservative MP said she sees no alternative other than backing a second referendum on leaving the EU.She becomes the latest Tory to support a new vote, saying the right-wing of her party had made Theresa Mays Chequers Brexit plan - dead.She told BBC: They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands.Allen campaigned to Remain in the EU in .She said there was no alternative other than asking – should we come to that, no deal, that looks like thats whats going to happen – then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.Wollaston, the Conservative MP for Totnes, said she has signed up to the Peoples Vote campaign for a vote on the final Brexit deal.The -year-old was previously the only Conservative MP to officially support the campaign.When asked why she is in support of the second referendum, Wollaston said: “If in two years’ time there are serious unintended consequences, I don’t want people writing to me asking ‘what did you do ’ I want to be able to point to the things that I did try to do.Not because I want to block Brexit, but because I want to check we’re prepared.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British people will rightly expect a goodon that money.Yet, when it comes to taking back democratic control over our laws, the final terms are worse than membership of the EU.We would still be bound indefinitely by EU-imposed rules on customs, trade, employment, social policy and tax – with no say over those rules, and no ability to exit the regime.The government rightly resisted pressure to accept Free Movement of people from EU countries, to allow us to regain control over our immigration policy.But, the current deal leaves it open for the EU to refuse a permanent trade deal unless we cave in during the second phase of negotiations, after March.As for the dream of a global Britain trading more energetically from Asia to Latin America, the EU has tied our hands, hobbling those ambitions.Much has been made of the Northern Ireland Protocol. No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

I only want to be with her. I can never wait to see her.”Cue the nation emitting a collective swoon and ’Arry becoming odds-on favourite to take the jungle crown.“Aw, he’s sooooo lovely,” gushed one twentysomething TV commentator, asHarry had just bequeathed all his worldly possessions to help save an endangered species.Given the borderline hysterical response to this “man still loves we after  years” declaration, he might even be considered one himself.But is it really so unusual  To those dating in this Tinder-centric age where people start swiping right the second there’s a minor hiccup, perhaps. But to my generation, less so.Shortly after my Uncle Jack died in his early eighties, my Aunty Mabel announced that she wouldn’t be around for much longer because she couldn’t bear to be without him. Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and had to beg for lts from family and friends to get there.Her husband previously sorted out her finances, but has now moved out of the family home leaving her and their two kids Hannah, , and Zoe, , behind.Joanne, who lives in the West Midlands, is just one of hundreds of Brits who say that going onto Universal Credit has pushed them into debt.In last month’s Budget the Chancellor announced a raft of measures to help ease their struggle - but they won’t come in for months.New DWP Secretary Amber Rudd has vowed to “fix” the problems with the flagship benefits system, which rolls six payments into one.Last week she even hinted she could slash the five-week wait to try and help those who are desperate waiting for their first payment.Joanne’s got letters and phonecalls saying she is almost £ in debt on her rent alone - and could face eviction from her houseshe doesn’t pay soon.She opted for a £ advance to help her while she waited but soon struggled with making ends meet.“I’m struggling to pay for anything including food for my girls,” she added.“I’ve been worried to death, I haven’t had anything to eat some days.“I’ve been going around to my family to get food -

or even had a bank account.”She’s slashed her bills to the minimum amount she feels is possible but still is struggling to pay the bills.“Universal Credit has been a nightmare, the benefits system should have been left how it is,” she added.“It’s caused me so much trouble and stress.”A DWP spokeswoman said: “We offer advances of up to  per cent of the first Universal Credit payment to help people who need extra support, and we’ve announced a £m partnership with Citizens Advice to support vulnerable people with their claims.“Other benefits, such as Personal Independence Payments, are available for people with mental and physical health conditions to help with additional costs.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004516094471-e1543445105186.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain needs brexit leaders steve hilton opinion","story":"It says: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”When you look at the shambles Brexit has become, as far as Britain is concerned it’s not a possibility but a downright certainty.Let’s review the idiocy.It began with David Cameron stomping off in the biggest and most ruinous huff in history, leaving a sleep-deprived and shell-shocked Tory party scrambling to find a new leader overnight.Then Boris Johnson and Michael Gove threw away a golden opportunity as potential PM and deputy to achieve the vision of a positive, outward-looking, go-getting, post-Brexit Britain.Over a bizarre few days they stabbed each other in the back, shot themselves in the foot and indulged in whatever other self-harming metaphor you can think of.Their antics landed us with hapless and hopeless Theresa May, so desperate to prove she could deliver Brexit despite opposing it that she rushed into announcing the end-point without the faintest idea how to get there.More misguided Remainer pandering came from then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with her ludicrous plan to force businesses to list their foreign workers.This offensive announcement alienated Remain voters who might have given Brexit a chance and helped set in stone the horrible isiveness of the past two years.As Foreign Secretary, Boris made one gaffe after another, starting with the most heinous: Sticking to his silly remark about having your cake and eating it — guaranteed to wind up the EU bigwigs and make them even more determined to give Britain a rotten deal.On and on the idiocy has gone — from Philip Hammond trying to prove his discredited Project Fear predictions were right all along by being the most anti-businessConservative Chancellor anyone can remember, to Matt Hancock’s hysterical claims about people dying from a lack of medicineswe leave the EU without a deal. He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative. Unite to get rid of TheresaMay, then make the case with passion and conviction for a clean break and a radical pro-enterprise programme.Right now, Britain needs leaders.

Calornia up to Reno, Nevada, and all the way out west to Arizona.Inside the triangle are Las Vegas, Yosemite national park, and the top secret US base Area  and Death Valley.It takes up an area of almost , square miles and is half the size of England.The most famous case of a pilot going missing in over the arid plains of the Sierra Nevada happened  years ago.Billionaire adventurer Steve Fossett had set more than  records during his le time and was an incredibly experienced pilot.So when the airman’s single engine play vanished on the Calornia Nevada border in  rescuers were baffled.The largest search since the Second World War was launched to find Fosset who vanished on September  of that year.He was piloting as a single-engine Bellanca Super Decathlon over Nevada’s Great Basin Desert.Fossett had taken off from a private airstrip near Smith Valley, Nevada on the short journey to meet his fellow billionaire friend Barry Hilton.But when he failed to arrive six hours later a search was launched to find the missing adventurer.The search would expand into a nearly , square mile area of some of the most rugged terrain in North America.As they scoured the treacherous terrain for the remains of Fossett’s plane rescuers came across eight previously unidentied crash sites that had fallen victim to the triangle.Eventually, more than a year later, a hiker came across three crumpled ID cards that belonged to the billionaire.Then on October ,  they finally traced the wreckage to a spot  miles south of his take off site.Two bones discovered amongst the wreckage were later identied by DNA as belonging to Fossett.But the question remained, how did such an experienced pilot just plunge into the earth Conspiracy theories of aliens and government interference abounded online and in the media but it turns out the answer is much simpler, the weather.John Kelly has been flying in Nevada since  and heard about the Nevada Triangle from a TV show.He told news.au: Theres potentially more crashes because of the atmosphere in the mountains, but I dont think theres a phenomena.Its people flying over the mountains and misjudging the air pressure.The region is particularly susceptible to something called the Mountain Wave.When fast-moving winds from the Pacic hit the steep mountainsides, it creates a dangerous effect which can be pick up a small plane by the updraft like a surfer on a wave.But, just like many wave riders,it only to be dumped hard on the other side.At sea that is water, but in the desert that means the rock solid earth.Climatologist Kelly Redmond from the Desert Research Institute said the Sierra Nevada winds could be like getting caught in Niagara Falls.So, when the winds are coming up, they come up kind of smoothly on the west side and then they have this very rapid decent and there is a tremendous amount of turbulence that can be caused by such situations, he told KNPR in .Its quite easy for a small plane to get caught in the down draft on the downwind side and not have the power or just the capability to get out of the way of

He need only have explained to fellow passengers that he was finding the flight uncomfortable, rather than knowingly subject himself to an injurious event.In my view, his statements were his statements were intended to increase the size of the claimed encroachment and to create an exaggerated picture, rather than a genuine account.I accept that the passenger in seat J was a large man, both in the sense that he was very tall, broad, and carried signicant body weight. It is likely that there were occasions when, as a result of his size or his movements within his chair, that he did cause an inconvenience to Mr Prosser.But I do not accept the suggestion that his size was such that Mr Prosser was compelled to sit in an awkward way for the duration of the flight by virtue of him encroaching upon his seating area.The judge added that Mr Prosser had unrealistic expectations of how much room he should have had given the class of cabin he chose.The self-employed civil engineer had told the court earlier this month that he chose not to leave his seat because doing so would hassle the other passenger getting up, and did not take issue with him because he seemed self-conscious.Mr Prosser described the man as being ft in and weighing approximately  stone, and claimed he reminded him of late New Zealand rugby union player Jonah Lomu.He said: He was that large that he had to force his buttocks between the arm rests of the seats.He sat with his knees wedged against the seat in front and the rest of his body was overspilling into my seat by some inches.Mr Prosser, from Penygraig in Tonypandy, South Wales, said the incident in January  left him with a continual back spasm and an injury causing the sacroiliac joint at the bottom of his spine to dys.He said he had been unable to work overtime for three months as a result of his back pain, and it had left him lacking energy which had affected his relationship with his partner and forced him to give up mountain biking.Jack Harding, representing Mr Prosser, said a figure of £, had been submitted for the loss of earnings claim.Chris McLindon, the customer service manager on board the flight, said in a witness statement that Mr Prosser did not seem to be in any discomfort and at times he was asleep.Following the verdict a spokesman for British Airways said: We are pleased that the court agreed that Mr Prosser had room to fly comfortably.Our cabin crew will always do their best to make sure all our customers have a smooth journey, and in this case provided extra pillows and blankets to help Mr Prosser sleep."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452655712.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather forecast temperatures rocket 15c weekend","story":"The powerful system brought travel chaos across the UK and Ireland today as extreme weather closed bridges and mph gales left at least , homes without power.Threat-to-le warnings have finally lted after the powerful weather system - born of two high-speed Atlantic cyclones - grounded flights and left coastal roads swamped by huge sea swells.And from Friday, an area of low pressure moving eastwards across the UK is set to bring warmer weather to the south after a few blustery spells.Temperatures are expected to be cooler in the North, with parts of Scotland reaching C - three times cooler than the C predictions for this Sunday in the south.But over the next few days, blustery showers will be accompanied by dry, sunny spells, with warmer weather expected to set in by Saturday.Blustery showers will feature tonight in the west, particularly in north-west Scotland, with gales in the north and the west.Tomorrow, sunny spells will peep through, with the sunniest, driest weather in the southeast - though it will feel cooler.These rainy spells - calm in comparison to Dianas efforts - could clear for comparatively warm conditions in the South, which again will be notably warmer than the north throughout the weekend.The departure of Diana will come as a relief to Brits across the country after the storm wreaked widespread havoc across the UK.Today engineers were working desperately to restore power as entire towns in Ireland and South West England were left shrouded in darkness by downed electricity lines.Two people were injured when a tree uprooted by intense winds fell on their car in Compton Chamerlyne near Salisbury, Wilts.And the roof of an Asda supermarket was ripped off by winds in Oadby, Leics this morning, with a witness telling the Mercury: Half the roof above the entrance and exit was hanging down and swinging around.A dramatic rescue effort was mounted for workers on a North Sea oil rig left stranded without power, it emerged today.They were rescued yesterday from Shell’s Brent Charlie  -  miles northeast of Shetland - as it was lashed by torrential rain and high winds.Coastguard chiefs and Shell decided to declare an emergency and  non-essential members of the -strong workforce were evacuated to two neighbouring s.Power was restored last night, and  employees remain on board the  to repair the fault.Duty controller for the Coastguard service Angus MacIver said: “The safety of the crew has to be the main priority and due to the lack of power with severe incoming weather the decision was made to evacuate the .“The evacuation took about two hours, with our helicopter completing four trips to the  along with the Norwegian rescue helicopter.“Thankfully all crew remain safe and well.”Among the worst hit areas this morning were Kilkenny, Kildare and Cork in Ireland and Truro, Cornwall.Airports including Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh cancelled dozens flights due to high winds — with travel firms warning customers to check their provider today.Passengers were trapped on a train at Plymouth, Devon, after it was battered by waves — causing the doors to break.Commuters on the .am Exeter to Penzance service could not get off for ten minutes while the driver was forced to reset the doors.Meanwhile dramatic footage emerged today showing surfers risking their lives tackling huge waves off Orkney.The video, recorded by islander Bruce Flett, , from Kirkwall, led to a flood of comments from concerned viewers on social media.Christine Reid responded: “Wind is bad. The surfer is an idiot!”And Bill Bennett added: Quite irresponsible of the surfer. Not only is he putting his le in danger. Any rescuer would also be in danger.”Travel chaos is expected throughout Thursday as flooding and debris affects main roads — with the Met Office warning of nasty driving conditions.Up to mmof rain could fall in parts of Scotland in six hours, while a vast swathe of the UK could be hit by widespread strong winds.Switchcraft finds the best deal for you - and continues to switch you on to cheaper deals, so you never have to do it yourself.£ cashback is paid into your bank account within  months of completing the switch.

The wind is the major thing to look out for.Across the UK will get heavy and persistent rain but not as much as Scotland.We can expect mm to mm to fall where across the country.People will need to be careful on coastal roads, which will be affected by spray and large waves.People will need to exercise care around those areas.Winds will die down on Friday night before a barrage of Atlantic weather systems brings further torrential rain through the weekend, experts warn.A new cyclonic low, which will span , miles from the north of France to southern Greenland could be strong enough to warrant another named storm – Deirdre – before the weekend.WeatherAction’s Piers Corbyn said: There is certainly a chance of seeing mph gusts associated with Storm Diana and with a powerful jet stream in place across the country there is going to be a risk of further powerful systems bringing volatile weather to the UK over the coming days.”And AccuWeather meteorologist Eric Leister said: “The Thursday morning commute could feature signicant delays across Wales, the Midlands and southern England.“Daily rain and gusty winds are forecast for this weekend across the British Isles however, the risk for damaging winds and flash flooding will subside.”Meanwhile, bookies have slashed the odds on a White Christmas blowing in.Bookmakers Ladbrokes slashed odds to just   on any part of the UK seeing snow on December .A spokesman said: Punters dreaming of a White Christmas look as though theyre going to get their wish."},{"url":null,"title":"facebook messenger down uk europe","story":"Thousands of users say they have been unable to launch the messaging app.Many of the app users say that the issue has been going on since this morning, with many others being angry at the app.Some technical issues on the app appear to have stopped displaying when users are online, others are experiencing dficulties receiving notications.Many frustrated app users took to Twitter to express their annoyance at the apps performance.One user tweeted: I cannot see active friends on messenger.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leader insisted EU chiefs WILL allow the UK to renegotiate a pact - even after they said the current plan is the only one possible. EU leaders from  nations signed off Mrs Mays -page plan on Sunday. Now Theresa May is urging more than  Tory and DUP sceptics to change their minds and back it in a crucial vote in the House of Commons. She has warned MPs - including Mr Corbyn - have a duty to back the deal on December  because otherwise the UK could crash out without an agreement. But speaking to ITVs This Morning today, the Labour leader said there was no chance of it going through and predicted the EU would be open to negotiations.  They would understand wed be coming in with a dferent mandate, he said. He called for a general electionthe deal is voted down in  days time. At that point the new government, hopefully us, would negotiate the best we can with the EU, he said. Mr Corbyn predicted there could be a second House of Commons vote. But he would not be drawn on whether Labour would back a second referendum after December . He said only that a fresh referendum is one of the options that is on the table and his priority is the vote on December  - after that we decide what to do. The Mirror and other papers are saying there’s serious problems about this deal, Labours leader told host Phillip Schofield. Told a No Deal Brexit would be more expensive, he replied: Well, the alternative isn’t no deal. Nobody’s going to allow no deal. How could we  Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces one more hurdle - a vote in Parliament on December . MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to about , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, threatening to vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. Not all are expected to live up to their threats. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They say they will vote down the deal. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. Theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit. OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. Unknown LABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. Told he only had until March, the optimistic leader responded: Well…it’s December this weekend! He added: We have the vote on the th, Parliament makes its decision. I suspect it’s going to be no. The Prime Minister then has a limited number of days in order to go back to the EU and try to negotiate something . That comes back to parliament. All options are open then. He added: I think the government has conducted these negotiations so badly, starting particularly the atmosphere they started them off, the ludicrous comments made by Boris Johnson and others didn’t help the atmosphere.I think we could do a lot better. And also the insults being thrown at European Citizens were disgraceful.

Even those Labour MPs who were wavering, such as Gareth Snell who represents Stoke Central and Lisa Nandy in Wigan, have now said they cant support the PM.  May has tried to reach out over the heads of MPs by touring the country this week to drum up support for her plan. But a survey by Deltapoll shows that a majority of voters disbelieve her main claims. Askedthe Prime Minister was accurate to say “it was a good deal”, % say the claim is  and % say it is true. This list of Tory MPs, originally compiled by Buzzfeeds Alex Wickham, includes those on the Remain and Leave sides of the party. And it includes those who say they have written a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister. Mrs May is running out of time to convince wavering MPs ahead of the meaningful vote on  December. On the Sunday before, she and the leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn are set to go head-to-head in a live debate. But negotiations as to where and how this will happen are currently ongoing.Brexit TV debate row erupts as Theresa May and Corbyn back dferent channelsIf her deal fails to clear the Commons - as many predict - there are competing views as to what will happen next.Labour think she mayto the EU and try and get a better deal.But the EU Commission chair Jean-Claude Juncker said this was the only deal.The Prime Minister yesterday insisted the withdrawal agreement was the “best deal” on offer when grilled by senior MPs from the Commons’ Liaison committee. Mrs May refused to sayshe would allow the country to crash out without a dealher plan was voted down by Parliament despite warnings from the Treasury and Bank of England that would be economically disastrous. She suggested it would be in the hands of MPs as to what happened next. “The timetable is such that actually some people would need to take some practical steps in relation to no deal,” she said. Askedshe had drawn up a Plan B in the event she lost the vote, she replied: “The deal is the deal at this point of time.” The Prime Minister told the committee that a second referendum would lead to the collapse of any Brexit deal. “Any second referendum that would be held,that were the case, would not be able to be held by March  next year. You would have to extend Article ,” she said. She added: “To extend Article , actually you are then in the business of renegotiating the deal. “What is clear is that any extension to Article  - anything like that - reopens the negotiations, reopens the deal. At that point, frankly, the deal can go in any direction. “We would simply find ourselves in a period of more uncertainty, more ision in this country.” Today the chair of the Brexit committee Hilary Benn revealed he had tabled an amendment to the meaningful vote.The amendment, which has the backing of five committee chairs, opposes the deal, rejects a no deal Brexit and would enable the House to express its view about what should happen nextthe Prime Minister’s deal is defeated.

Next year I’ll be marking an anniversary..  years since I became HIV positive, he told those MPs gathered in the House of Commons for an adjournment debate on HIV and World AIDS day this afternoon.It is the first time a serving MP has ever spoken in the chamber of the House about such a diagnosis. It is a scary thing to do, he said in an exclusive interview before todays debate. But I am a paid politician and one of my jobs is to show how the personal becomes political, and vice versa.That doesnt meant the public need to know the ins and outs of every politicians personal le, but it does mean where there are links and you can help others, you need to speak out. MPs listened in silence as the young politician spoke about one of the most intimate aspects of his le.  He told the Commons: It’s been a long journey – from the fear to acceptance and from today advocacy, knowing my treatment keeps me healthy and that it protects any partner I have. The majesty of parliament is a far cry from the room where a decade ago Lloyd, then a -year-old student, found himself as he received his le-changing diagnosis. They took me into a consulting room about the size of a disabled toilet and decorated in pretty much the same kind of way plasticated seating,  ceilings, bright neon light and those beige walls they all have. The person whod done my blood test came in with a woman counsellor. I remember them saying, we have got some bad news and is there anyone you will be able to talk to afterwards and I just said Yeh, yeh just tell me what it is. And when they do, ithits you like a wall. My first feeling was this is some joke, this is some candid camera and someone is going to pop around the corner and say Surprise. It would be a horrible kind of joke but you still hope that might be it.Or its some kind of stringent sex education lesson to scare the shit out of you. But unfortunately it is not that. Your mouth goes dry and there is that sick but not sick feeling inside that feels like you want to get rid of everything inside you – but there is nothing inside you because its aseverything has been taken away. And your brain is working at a million miles away so youre not really listening to what theyre saying – thats just mumbling in the background.   I remember having a reallystrong thought that it would mean Illnever be able to have childrenwhich is a strange thought because as a gay man there is always the possibility you may not have children. But it is that loss of opportunity. At the time Lloyd was working for the Student Union at university in Bradford. Having known he was gay from as soon as I knew what the word meant he became sexually active during his late teens and ensured he had regular health checks. It was after one of these he received a call from the clinic asking him toimmediately to that fateful consulting room. Looking back there were signs, but I had no idea at the time. About a week or two after I must have contracted the infection I had the most awful fever which lasted about three days. Every night I woke and my sheets were sodden and every bone and muscle in my body hurt. But weve all had flu like that and so I didnt ever think of it in an HIV context. And then I had a cough for about six months. I was on the board of the university and I remember the Vice Chancellor saying: I can always tell youre coming down the corridor because I hear your cough first. I went to the doctors who tested for a chest infection and asthma but I still never thought it might be HIV. And so the diagnosis that afternoon came as an enormous shock. Lloyd, , who is MP for Kemptown in Brighton where he was born, was too young to remember the HIV and AIDS awareness advertising campaign which terried a generation in the early s. But I do remember a hangover from that time and growing up with the idea that HIV was something you die from, he says.   I think I remember being at the beach with my mum one day when I was little and going into the public loos and there was blood all over a sink and Mum saying: Dont go near there, you dont know what you will catch,there are very dangerous diseases in blood. So there has always been that spectre. But I wasnt some uneducated naiumlve person. I knew HIV wasnt a death sentence any more but my knowledge was probably ten years out of date – and that was ten years ago. In my imagination I knew Id survivethe odds were with me but Id be wedded to a regime of drugs with nasty side effects. The reality, Lloyd soon discovered, was very dferent. He was put on a one a day anti-viral drug with minimal side effects. And six months ago he was put onto a new drug with no side effects at all. HIV is officially undetectable in his body and he is unable to pass it on to anyone. Le expectancy for people with HIV is now just three years less than for anyone .   After diagnosis Lloyds first concern was to inform former partners so they could be checked out. The dficult thing is you have to trace back your former partners and then it is how you tell them, he recalls. I went round trying to tell them in person.I remember one person, it must have been about a week or two later,was quite angry. He said why on earth didnt you ring me straight away  but I hadnt wanted him to be on his own when he found out, even though I didnt think wed done anything unsafe together. But I had to tell him. Lloyd has never seen the man again who he believes unwittingly infected him during sex. But he refuses to harbour resentment – either to the former partner or himself - for having unsafe sex. You have to lead your le andyou go around feeling angry or distressed thats not going to help me.   Of course Ive felt frustrated with myself and thought what an idiot I was. Butyou keep feeling that you eat yourself up.You have to live your le and thats not going to be helped by second guessing what I should have done.But you can help aid other lives by making people aware. Which brings us of course to why Lloyd has now chosen to speak out so publicly about his condition. Until today just two of his closest colleagues in parliament knew he was HIV positive. I did consider whether I should have talked about it when I was standing as MP for the first time in , but it was a short election campaign and I wanted to talk about how we were going to transform Britain. Now Ive been an MP for two years and its good to get things off my chest and be open. On December it is the World Aids Day and its almost  years since I became HIV so it felt the right time. A turning point came at a local awards ceremony where Id nominated the organiser of an HIV lunch club. He went up and they showed a video of the people he helped and afterwards I was on stage saying how brave those people were for speaking out. And I had these feelings of Am I not a bit of a hypocrite here because Im saying how it is important for people to speak out but havent said, oh by the way – thats me too. But is he not worried about how some people might react – particularly in the bearpit of modern politics  There will always be people who say nasty things but you cant live your le worrying about what the haters will think, he says. There is concern though that people will think about me dferently. Already some people who know can act dferently, even when they are trying to be nice, saying How are you feeling  all the time.And thats great every now and again but not all the time - because I am absolutely fine. In an ideal world this announcement woudlnt mean anything but until you get to that point you have to have outriders who put their heads above the parapet.  Just one MP has previously spoken about having HIV – Labours Chris Smith who revealed his condition shortly before leaving politics in . During Mr Russell-Moyles speech Jeremy Corbyn was allowed to intervene in a break with convention to praise his colleagues bravery and to pay tribute to Mr Smith who was a personal friend and fellow MP.  I do think it is important we have new voices talking about the new realities of HIV otherwise well end up with people not realising how things have changed. Certainly his diagnosis appears to have galvanised Lloyds dedication to public service. Of course the diagnosis changes you and how you see le and you become much more concerned about things like the health service. I know there is a cost just to survive on the pill I take every day and so you are immensely thankful to the NHS for keeping you alive. But there becomes this horrible creeping feeling when you see the NHS being destroyed - which I think it is being.  The drug treatment regime in the developing world is  a day. In Britain, with all the extra tests we provide, it is  a month. But in the US, under their medical system, the same treatment is , a month. So suddenly you seewe are creeping towards an American health system that cost burden – and getting the insurance for it – are not just political discussions they are discussions where I think, I could be deadthings go the wrong way. Lloyd is particularly angry at a decision for a daily pill to prevent people ever contracting HIV not being rolled out across England – despite it being available in Wales and Scotland.   It was approved for use then at ministerial level it was stopped because they said they wanted to do a trial on behaviour changes of people taking it – which was basically the argument used when the contraceptive pill was first around, he says. We know there are young people who have asked for it but been denied it and ended up contracting HIV. This pill could wipe HIV out. We know what was achieved with polio. And while we are far off from abolishing HIV globally, we could in Britain start that push back. But instead the government is doing poundmillion cuts in sexual health. What happens for Lloyd after his announcement in the Commons remains to be seen.At present he is single but dating occasionally – each time having to explain to prospective new partners that he is HIV positive. Politically he seems more determined than ever to use the le he is being given - by our NHS - for good. Its not just about being alive, he says. Its about using that le to make things better. And thats what I feel I must do.

The push for another EU poll was backed by ex-minister Jo Johnson who said it could have a healing effect. Ms Greening said thatPrime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit deal is voted down by the Commons on December , organising a new referendum could begin immediately. She said: Ive worked out that you could plan and hold a referendum in  weeks. We could actually, after this vote on December , hold a referendum, potentially, on May  next year. We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article , Ive suggested, by four months to July . Ms Greening insisted the necessary legislation could be passed during the time frame and the referendum question could include three options remaining in the EU, leaving on the terms of Mrs Mays agreement, or leaving without a deal. The ex-Cabinet minister said voters could list their choice in order of preference, as in mayoral elections. Ms Greening said voters had to decide on the issue because they were tired of a Game of Thrones-style approach to Brexit in Parliament. Speaking at the same event in London, Mr Johnson - who quit as transport minister earlier this month in protest at Mrs Mays Brexit agenda - said a new referendum could have a positive impact on the country. Mr Johnson said that a new referendum would allow the Government to concentrate on domestic issues.  He said: Some say giving the public the final say will tear the country apart. In fact, I believe an honest debate in light of the experience we have all had as a country over the last two-and-a-half years could be part of a necessary healing process that will allow us toto the agenda the PM herself so eloquently outlined on the housing crisis, our poor social mobility, our poor productivity. Mr Johnson, whose brother is arch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, urged MPs to vote against Mrs Mays deal as it was a worst of all worlds Brexit and bad for the country and the Tory partys election chances. The ex-transport minister said the Conservatives risk an election disaster on the scale of they back Mrs Mays plans. He said: Both the deal and no deal would be disastrous for our economy. The Conservative Partys reputation for economic competence would be undermined by implementing a botched Brexit, especially one that the Governments own analysis suggests will cause economic harm. Brexit is seen as a project driven by the Conservative Party and this half-baked, worst of all worlds Brexit could trigger an electoral defeat on the scale of , or worse, with this Tory Brexit label an albatross around our necks for years to come.

The Prime Minister ramped up her threat of a No Deal by warning planning will start in earnesther deal is defeated. That was despite her admitting shed backed down to the EU over her demand for frictionless trade. And she slagged off her own government, suggesting its much-feted Brexit analysis wasnt actually that good. Awkward scenes ensued as the Liaison Committee - made up of Parliaments committee chairs - askedshell make the EU friends with benefits after March . And she gave more than her share of classic Prime Ministerial death stares. Here are the  highlights of this mornings hearing. . When she got asked about friends with benefits   Theresa May appeared not to know what friends with benefits are, in an exchange that was exactly as awkward as you think it was. Tory MP Tom Tugendhat described leaving the EU as the most complex orce talks ever, followed by the most complex marriage negotiations as the UK tries to get a trade deal. Im not sure a remarriage is perhaps the correct analogy, Theresa May replied. Were going to be very good friends and working closely together. He interjected: Friend with benefits, Prime Minister  As laughter erupted in the Commons committee room, the PM stalled. Uhh, sorry  she said, leaning forward. I missed your quip, Im sorry. Friends with benefits, Prime Minister  the Foreign Affairs Committee chief asked again, firmly. Mrs May sat back up, almost asshe hadnt heard the question. Either she didnt hear him, or she didnt know what he meant, or she just tried to pretend she didnt know.  Theresa May came under fire after government economic analysis said every form of Brexit will be worse than staying in the EU. So of course she distanced herself from it - a day after it was released. The PM said: The Government analysis does not identy - does not deal with - all the issues that I have spoken about. Because it doesn’t deal with decisions that the Government might take, and it can’t. . When she pretty much admitted shed backed down to the EU  One of the main reasons Tory MPs are angry is the deal stops short of promising frictionless trade. This was a key promise by the Prime Minister. But today she admitted itd been blocked by EU states. She said: The detail of that is being negotiated it is still open to frictionless trade.I have said in the House of Commons - I have been honest with people - that we have not persuaded everybody in Europe yet about absolutely frictionless trade. The ambition is there in the political declaration to be as near to frictionless as possible.   Jeremy Corbyn today insisted nobodys going to allow no deal. But the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to rule out crashing out of the EU without agreement on March . She was asked to rule it out given her own economic forecastshave warned it could plunge Britain into an economic crisis. However, she said: If the House votes down that deal at that point, then there will be some steps that will be necessary.Obviously we have been doing no deal planning as a Government. But at a point at which the House,it were to do so, voted down the deal that has been agreed, given that the European Union has been clear that this is the deal that has been agreed and this is the deal that is on the table, then obviously decisions would have to be taken in relation to the action that would need to be taken to prepare. She also refused to rule out a hard border with Northern Ireland and the Republic. You cant avoid a hard border just through goodwill, political statements and wishful thinking, she said. ... But MPs said they just dont believe her   In a brutal exchange, Labours Yvette Cooper said: Knowing you for  years, I just do not believe thatyour deal goes down, you are the kind of person who would contemplate taking this country into a no deal situation. Am I wrong  She later told the PM: You are just not being straight with people.Isn’t your real problem here that because you haven’t got agreement to any of this, because it is still a spectrum, as your own documents say, actually you are really saying to people, “Trust me I will sort it out in the second phase. But because you are not being straight with people on any of these things... you are not able to build up that trust   To a rather confusing point by Tory Julian Lewis. . ... And this one....  When Tory Sarah Wollaston said her deal simply wont pass. . ... And this one   She was asked to stay late - but said she had a plane to catch. And when it was suggested she could come more often, the PM said coldly: I think we have arrangements for the number of times I come to the committee in any year. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK.

Andrew Murrison - chairman of the Commons Northern Ireland committee - gave a masterclass in pivoting from greasy compliments to a devastating takedown. He said: Can I start by saying that I have huge respect for the energy that you have applied in trying to get the best deal possible for our country Nobody could have worked harder than you. He then immediately added: Can I ask you first what plans you have to govern in the event that you win the vote, given that you will be doing so without the DUP  The DUP - who prop up the Tory government - have vowed to review their poundbn confidence and supply dealthe Brexit deal passes. . When she admitted a vital security database isnt yet part of her deal Mrs Mays security minister Ben Wallace has been touring TV studios today warning No Deal would put people at greater risk. During that he heaped praise on the EUs SIS II database, which keeps records of wanted people.But, er, her draft dealdoesnt actually guarantee access to that database anyway. Yvette Cooper asked: Can you confirm that we do not have access agreed to the SIS II database or the ECRIS database in the political declaration The Prime Minister admitted: We do not have the SIS II database and the ECRIS database specically identied in the political declaration.What we do have is reference to exchange of information on wanted or missing persons and objects and of criminal records, which of course are what SIS II and ECRIS cover.  . When she refused to rule out a secret Plan B The PM was asked repeatedly to rule out considering a dramatic Plan B to follow the model of Norway and stay in the customs union and EEA. This would be a much softer Brexit than the UK is agreeing now. She did not rule it out. Instead she said: What I am focused on and what the Government is focused on is the vote that will take place on  December. You want to look at all sorts of options and ideas, and so on and so forth.I think it is important that Members of Parliament focus on the nature of this vote. This is an important point in our history.

Thousands of families like hers are facing a Christmas shycancelled by Universal Credit. But for the past year, her severely disabled dad Alan Oakman has been paying to buy a hamper for her young family so they don’t have to spend the festive season at the food bank. “My dad’s amazing,” Lucy says. “It means unlike so many others we’ll have something in the cupboards.” This week the Mirror received a moving letter from Alan, who lives in Swansea. “I am writing to you on my daughter’s behalf,” it said.“She was put on Universal Credit. This month she got a payment of pound, half last month’s amount.Her rent is pound a month. That leaves pound for her to pay bills and buy food for her and her baby.” Alan added: “I am severely disabled, in a wheelchair, unable to walk and nearly blind.It is very upsetting what this Government is doing to people. The way things are going, I really worry for her safety.” When I call Lucy, she is fighting back tears. “I’ve never been in this situation in my le, it’s degrading,” she says. “We waited seven weeks for Universal Credit.   What were we supposed to live on  Now, since I’ve been moved over, they’ve been taking more money off me and wanting more back. “You hear all these stories in the news of people taking their own lives. You can totally believe it.And you can see how people end up at the food bank. My son is two.I need to buy nappies, pay the household bills, pay the rent first to make sure we aren’t evicted. Where does the money come from for food ” While the political classes agonise over Brexit, the misery machine of Universal Credit rolls on into another festive season.The built-in five-week waiting period means anyone transferred to the hated new benefit after November  faces Christmas Day with empty cupboards.This week the Mirror revealed food banks are braced for their busiest Christmas ever because of the five-week wait and UC’s other deep problems. The Trussell Trust alone – which runs about half of the UK’s food banks – says it is expecting to feed . million meals to starving families, including a shocking , children. It’s not just the five-week wait. “My husband works as a barber,” says Lucy, .“I’ve always worked. But at the moment I’ve got a young child and I’m trying to get an Open University degree to better myself.” Her husband is Turkish and not classed as resident in the UK so he doesn’t qualy for UC.His earnings as a self-employed barber are taken into account, though, in Lucy’s payments. So, he is invisible for help, and visible when it comes to taking money away.The result has been a signicant loss in help since transferring from child tax credits and housing benefit. The DWP says that “Universal Credit payments reflect the earnings and circumstances of the entire household. No one needs to wait for their first payment as up to % advance payments are available from day one”.   But, of course, fear of debt prevents many people from borrowing what must be then paid back every month. Meanwhile, this week a group of single mums on Universal Credit shychallenged the scheme in the High Court for being “irrational”. Under UC, working parents are shyentitled to keep the first pound they earn within a one-month assessment period. But a problem happens when people get paid twice within the same calendar month – for example when there’s a bank holiday or over Christmas when wages may be paid early.When this happens, they look as though they are on double pay in the first month, so get little or no help, often due to the Benefit Cap. And in the second month it will look asthey earned nothing.So there’s no protected amount. Families also find the fluctuating payments impossible to budget for. In three cases brought by the Child Poverty Action Group, care assistant Erin Barrett has had to use food banks and twice tried to take her own le. Katie Stewart had to leave her job to find one with a pay date which suits the new system, and Claire Woods was left to rely on a food bank and forced to turn down a promotion at work. Meanwhile, Danielle Johnson’s lawyer, Tessa Gregory from Leigh Day, said the system left Danielle pound a year poorer. Danielle told the court: “I have never been this financially unstable before.” In interviews to mark her new job, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd claims that Universal Credit “really has transformed lives” in her constituency in Hastings and Rye. This is true.

He also claimed that he suffered a loss of earnings.But today, his civil claim against the airline at Pontypridd County Court in Wales was dismissed by District Judge Andrew Barcello, who said Mr Prosser had exaggerated the description of the other passenger.The judge said that while Mr Prosser may have exacerbated a degenerative spinal condition during the flight from Bangkok, Thailand, to London Heathrow, he could have just asked to swap seats with another passenger.   Judge Barcello said: He is articulate, intelligent and forthright.He need only have explained to fellow passengers that he was finding the flight uncomfortable, rather than knowingly subject himself to an injurious event.In my view, his statements were his statements were intended to increase the size of the claimed encroachment and to create an exaggerated picture, rather than a genuine account.I accept that the passenger in seat J was a large man, both in the sense that he was very tall, broad, and carried signicant body weight.It is likely that there were occasions when, as a result of his size or his movements within his chair, that he did cause an inconvenience to Mr Prosser.  But I do not accept the suggestion that his size was such that Mr Prosser was compelled to sit in an awkward way for the duration of the flight by virtue of him encroaching upon his seating area.The judge added that Mr Prosser had unrealistic expectations of how much room he should have had given the class of cabin he chose.Mr Prosser had told the court earlier this month that he chose not to leave his seat because doing so would hassle the other passenger getting up. The self-employed civil engineer also said he chose not to take issue with the passenger on the -hour flight because he seemed self conscious. Mr Prosser described the man as being ft in and around st, claiming he reminded him of late New Zealand rugby union player Lomu. He claimed: He was that large that he had to force his buttocks between the arm rests of the seats. He sat with his knees wedged against the seat in front and the rest of his body was overspilling into my seat by some inches. Mr Prosser, from Penygraig in Tonypandy, said the incident in January  left him with a continual back spasm and an injury causing the sacroiliac joint at the bottom of his spine to dys. He said he had been unable to work overtime for three months as a result of his back pain, and it had left him lacking energy. He claimed this had affected his relationship with his partner and forced him to give up mountain biking.   Jack Harding, representing Mr Prosser, said a figure of pound, had been submitted for the loss of earnings claim. Chris McLindon, the customer service manager on board the flight, said in a witness statement that Mr Prosser did not seem to be in any discomfort and at times he was asleep. Following the verdict, a spokesman for British Airways said: We are pleased that the court agreed that Mr Prosser had room to fly comfortably. Our cabin crew will always do their best to make sure all our customers have a smooth journey, and in this case provided extra pillows and blankets to help Mr Prosser sleep.

Daughter Beth, who works at the Royal Bank of Scotland, explained how deep the festive spirit runs in the Gibbs family. She said: My dad has always been a big fan of Christmas. Hes a big kid really. It started when we were little with just two little snowmen and a Father Christmas. He started buying Christmas decorations during the sales, and over the years, the collection has just got bigger and bigger. We ended up having to buy another shed just to store it all.   The family have spent months preparing the arrangement at their semi-detached home in Benfleet, Essex, with Daniel even taking time off work to get everything ready. Beth said: My mum actually tries to stop him going to the sales to buy more things. Its become a bit of an obsession. I asked my dad how much the electricity bill goes up, and he didnt say.

The -year-old said thanks to everyone outside Almondbury school today as around  protesters voiced concern about the viral video. The teenager, who was head butted and water boarded in the shocking footage, smiled as he was brought to the scene by his father who also thanked the public. The teen, called Jamal, only spent a few minutes at the scene before leaving in a green car. It is the first time Jamal has been seen in public after his family lawyer and father said they had no problem with his picture being published. An online appeal set up to help the family topped pound, in  hours. Mohammed Akunjee, the teenagers lawyer, said he is considering taking legal action against Tommy Robinson on the familys behalf after the water-boarding victim was wrongly linked by the former EDL leader to an attack on a schoolgirl. This is something that has just added to the terrible situation Jamal is in.  The organiser of the protest, Mirban Aslam, , said the system had failed the Syrian refugee and his family. He said he was shocked it has taken West Yorkshire Police so long to summon the boy to court to face a charge of assault. He believed this only happened due to the viral coverage the video has received. Mirban, from Bradford, West Yorkshire said the police are trying to wash the hands of the incident by charging the boy.  He added: From information we got yesterday the sister seems to have been bullied and it is still going on. It happened in October, [the police] decided to charge the bully yesterday morning because of this public outcry. They are trying to wash their hands of it in case anything comes back on them why has anyone been charged  Charging him yesterday morning, they think nobody is going to say anything but we want it to be investigated. What are the issues  Why has it taken so long   What other issues have this family and others faced, is there others across the country  Mirban, a bricklayer, said it is not only the police who are to blame for the reaction. He said: It is not just the police, it is the school themselves.  If it happened at any other school there are protocols there that they follow and call parents in and have a chat. The victim has had his arm broken on more than one occasion and that is unbelievable. [The bully] has stayed in school. Why have the police kept quiet about it  I would love to speak to the family.  The protest is all about that family and safeguarding them and others out there who might be in a similar situation. Something needs to be set up for them, the system is failing them. Not just the school system, there is something not right.  Something needs to be created to help those that are being bullied, what  is going on out there  You have got prevent measures in schools which target Muslims, but has this boy been sanctioned under these measures .

Peter Thorold, who supplies sprouts to Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl, said the driest summer in his -year career has created a “crisis”. He said: “There’s going to be huge shortages. There will be a quarter less sprouts than last year. They’ve not been growing. “Other vegetables are also in trouble. There’s half as many potatoes as last year. Carrots and parsnips are the same, leeks are down.” Mr Thorold said his Lincolnshire business was pound, down on last year, adding: “There was one period when we had  days without rain. I knew then the Christmas supply would be dented.”   Rob Clayton from AHDB Potatoes said spuds had also been nobbled by the earlier cold snap.

In an interview with the programme, Ms Lovell said she wanted to believe Hawthorn did not pose a threat. But he had portrayed himself as a strong man who had previously raped women and was obsessive about Ms Lovell. These werent a couple of cards that came out of the blue, there were four years of cards before that, that were just filthy, she said. Then suddenly there were these two years of the threats, that just got progressively worse.  He would talk about how he was going to do it and it was very physical and so in my mind he was sexually aggressive, misogynistic, strong and frightening. Ms Lovell and BBC security teams contacted Avon and Somerset Police in January , after the rape threats began. Images of the greetings cards Ms Lovell had been sent were circulated, as well as examples of the handwriting inside them. They were usually signed Gordon with five crosses and often had an animal pictured on the front, which was regularly a cat.  When askedshe ever believed officers would track down the author of the cards, Ms Lovell replied: We all knew it was a real long shot. It was kind of frightening as well because Ive got this image of a big bloke who could see this when its being shared and he could suddenly act out on all these threats, all these things he was going to do - that hed been close, he knew where I was - so there was a real threat for me. Im thinking whats going to be his reaction .  It was a long shot but it was shared so much on social media and actually Ive got to thank everyone that shared it because thats how he ended up being arrested. It was just amazing that it came to that finally, to that conclusion.  Ms Lovell appealed to other victims of stalking to talk to somebody, as well as to write about their experiences in detail. Lovell, who has been presenting on BBC Points West since , also worked on Brainteaser on Channel Five and a live shopping channel. She urged anyone in a similar situation to act.

Alan Williams, , had radical prostatectomy to remove a large mass on his prostate and save his le earlier this year. But, after his catheters were removed, the father-of-two, from Telford, Shropshire, found hed lost control of his bladder. He described the crushing moment as bad as receiving the cancer diagnosis itself. Speaking exclusively to , the engineering manager said: Being an active person before, being housebound and restricted from the quality of le I was used to was extremely dficult. I completely lost my confidence, I was wetting myself like a baby.   At home you were safe because you always had a toilet to visit but going out the house was out of your control, it was frightening. The times when I did leave the house were humiliating. Alan, who lived an active le and enjoyed the outdoors before his diagnosis, had to wear incontinence pads. He went through around four every day. This destroyed Alan so much he wouldnt leave his home to take his we of  years out for dinner or even walk his dogs. He struggled to talk to his friends, particularly men. The dad, originally of north Wales, added: The feeling of having a lack of control of your bladder is indescribable. Once you start, you can’t stop. I was unable to do basic things such as taking my dogs for a walk or go out for dinner. Often, I would only last a few minutes before wanting tohome. I felt horrible and filled with worryI couldn’t access a toilet.  I was a slave to the loo. The embarrassment to have to wear pads was terrible. You take self-control for granted. I found it very dficult. It destroys your le.   Alan became incontinent in August days after the operation, which doctors stressed was the only optionhe wanted to survive. He described the warnings of incontinence as brief and underplayed. But when Alans humiliating ordeal became unbearable, he scoured the web for ways to speed up his recovery. Last month, the car enthusiastic by chance came across a pair of shorts with electro muscle stimulation technology, said to help aid bladder weakness.   Hes been wearing the INNOVO shorts for four weeks and has found himself to become like a dferent person. While doctors in Telford, Shropshire, havent said his incontinence has been cured, Alan first stopped showing symptoms this week. His said his months of torture are finally over. He continued: I now have my le back. I am no longer a slave to being stuck in the home. I am walking my dogs again and enjoying an active le with my family. I’ve been able to go back to work now too. There is not enough awareness of how horric bladder weakness can be. To me, suffering with Incontinence and prostate cancer were as bad as each other - the latter is le threatening, but the former impacts your quality of le beyond anything imaginable. I want to share my story to awaken those suffering with incontinence that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that there is a solution and you do not need to put up with a le living in incontinence pads.

There were long-whispered claims Wallis was a he, that she engaged in sado-masochistic sexual practices, that she had used her wiles to entice Edward VIII from his duty. So it cant be long before somebody - probably another Markle, considering their back catalogue - claims that Meghan once owned a pair of furry handcuffs and has Harry under her thumb. It all feeds into the narrative of there being a right sort of woman, and a wrong sort.

But Sarah is seen as a harmless clown whos a bit of an embarrassment. Meghan is regarded more like Diana in her final years - so unprincess-like that shes a threat to the monarchy itself.

The ivory silk gown was worn by the Princess of Wales on a state visit to Bahrain which formed part of her  tour of the Gulf States. It was later donated to a used dressed shop in Hereford by the housekeeper of the nearby Mynde Park estate, which was home to Dianas close friend Caroline Twiston-Davies. The unnamed buyer bought the David Emanuel frock in  after she spotted it while working part-time in the shop. The shop assistant, not knowing its signicance, paid around pound for the full- dress and had intended to wear it to a hunt ball. But she never attended the event and the dress remained in her wardrobe.   She only recently realised its importance when she saw a documentary of Diana wearing it in the Gulf. She has now decided to part with it and it is due to go under the hammer with Kerry Taylor Auctions of Bermondsey, South London. They have given it a pre-sale estimate of between pound, and pound,. Auctioneer Kerry Taylor said there remains a huge market for anything relating to Diana. She said: The owner paid pound for the dress. She knew it belonged to Diana but didnt realise its importance until several years later.  She watched a documentary on the Princess that showed her wearing the dress and she realised it was the one sitting in a box in her wardrobe, unworn, in all that time. Although there are millions of Princess Diana fans, there are relatively few people with the funds to afford a gown like this. However, it is a very important dress and we expect fierce bidding on the day. It is in perfect condition and is a unique one off piece.   Designed by David Emanuel, who was also behind Dianas wedding dress, the gown has long sleeves and floats down to the ground. It was specically designed to cover as much of her body as possible in a bid to conform with local customs in the Gulf States. There is a large bow behind the left shoulder and glistening jewels encrusted along the sleeves and top half of the dress. The princess famously wore the gown when she and Prince Charles attended a banquet hosted by the Emir of Bahrain. She matched it with a glittering tiara and diamond and pearl droplet earrings. The Emir later re-counted a conversation with the Princess, who had asked him what he would think  his son were to marry a tall, blonde English woman  He replied that he would be very jealous. Also in the same sale is one of Dianas blazers which was also donated to the same shop.   The s Cha Design Company jacket has lightly padded shoulders with low-set gilt buttons.

Natasha Whitehead, , used to get into debt by splurging up to a staggering pound, on festive presents for her two young daughters. She would spend the season feeling stressed about money, anxious to provide the perfect day for Bailey-Grace, , and Isabelle, nine. But this year, she has saved a fortune on gts for the youngsters - thanks to coupons, competitions, freebies and cashback apps. The mum decided to tackle s celebrations a little dferently after reading an online article about couponing - where someone collects discount vouchers to score as big a saving as possible. Scroll down for Natasha’s top  tips  Beginning in January, she stockpiled freebies or items she managed to blag for a fraction of their original price throughout the year. And now, she has successfully amassed presents worth hundreds of pounds for her family - saving herself both money and stress. Natasha, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said: “Christmas is dficult, as you want to be able to give your children everything. Add a magical touch of sparkle to your home this year with a dazzling light display only from wilko. With selected lights half price, there’s a great range of festive fun to transform your home into a winter wonderland. What are you waiting for  Find your nearest store at wilko  “It’s easy to panic buy and spend far too much. In the past few years, I’ve ended up getting myself into debt, easily spending pound, on gts that the kids get bored of opening half way through. “This year, I wanted to take things back to an old school family Christmas, and focus on appreciating the magic of the season, rather than stressing about money.” The mum dabbled a little in money-saving tactics - using discount codes and entering online competitions - when the girls were tiny.   But she grew serious about couponing at the beginning of the year. Vowing in January to be as organised as possible, so her festivities would be close to free, she said: “When I first found out about the couponing world, it was by stumbling across a freebie that was being offered by a skincare company on Facebook. “At the time, I didn’t understand why brands were just handing stuff out – but now I see that the savings are out thereyou know where to look. “It gets almost addictive, seeing what  you can win or what other discount coupons you can find. It doesn’t just help me, either. I’ve managed to win food that I’ve donated to food banks.” Through entering online competitions, Natasha has been able to buy some books using a pound WH Smith voucher prize, and food using a pound Co-op voucher she scooped. She also swears by cashback apps. Soaring in popularity over the past couple of years, the apps work by inviting users to upload pictures of their receipts, which are then scanned, before money is given back on certain items.  “If you’re smart and combine coupons with cashback apps, you can even make a profit,” said the mum, who works at a junior school. “You literally get paid to buy things you’d need to get anyway. Sometimes, they also offer freebies. I’ve managed to get some bottles of nice alcohol, which ordinarily would cost at least pound each, and chocolates. “I’ve then put together little hampers as Christmas presents for people, made up of things I’ve been stashing throughout the year. I think it helps me to be more thoughtful in my gts, as I’m not just grabbing something straight off the shelf in a panic. It’s more personalised.” Natasha also has a number of store loyalty cards, which she has managed to build up enough points on to buy presents such as beauty products and candle gt sets. She has purchased these gts in shops that she would have needed to use anyway. And she regularly signs up to online mailing lists, to take advantage of the introductory discount codes they frequently offer.  “The best is when there’s no minimum spend, said the mum. I got a pound Boux Avenue one the other day, which I got some really nice socks with. I also got a Jack Wills one, again for pound, which enabled me to get some lovely accessories for just p each. “I always opt to pick things up in store, too, to save on delivery. I’ll put aside one day when I go and collect everything, so I dont have to go back and forth.” Explaining that when it comes to money saving, organisation is key, Natasha told how she sets aside time every morning to sit down with a cup of tea and scroll the web for new deals. She then checks again on her phone throughout the day, scouring social media just in case anything new has sprung up. She also regularly fills out online surveys in exchange for cash or high street vouchers. “I know lots of people can’t be bothered with sting through emails, especially when you’re signed up to a lot of mailing lists, but it’s worth doing in case you miss a discount code,” she said.   “The same goes for surveys, too. You can sit and fill them out in front of the TV in the evenings. It doesn’t need to take long, but it pays off. “I’ve even managed to get ahead with next Christmas and already have pound worth of LoveShop vouchers, which can be used in loads of dferent high street stores, to go towards it.” Now more or less finished with her Christmas shopping before December has even begun, Natasha is looking forward to being able to properly relax and enjoy the season of goodwill with her daughters. She continued: “If you can afford to splurge at Christmas then that’s fantastic, but that wasn’t me, and it was getting silly - the amount of stress I’d cause myself. “For the first time ever, I can actually sit back and enjoy it. “Christmas doesn’t need to break the bank – there are ways of saving money. You’ve just got to think outside the box. She added: “This has also been a great learning curve for the girls. I like to get them involved, too. The cost of living is going up, but wages aren’t. I dread to think what it’ll be like by the time they’re adults, so it’s important to learn now about being savvy.” Natasha’s top  tipsDon’t buy for the sake of it. Just because something is in the sale, does not mean it is a bargain – especiallyit is something you do not need. If you see a freebie, apply quickly. There are often a limited amount on offer, and they soon get snapped up. Be organised. If you put aside little bits here and there throughout the year, you will be totally sorted for Christmas by November. Be patient. Dedicate a little time every day to scrolling for coupons, and slightly longer for entering competitions. Don’t ignore your emails! Companies often send discount codes or vouchers for birthdays, oryou are newly registered to a mailing list."},{"url":null,"title":"storm diana stomach churning moment","story":"NewsStorm Diana: Stomach-churning moment plane is blown violently in mph windsPlanes from EasyJet and Ryanair were battered by strong winds above Newcastle AirportShareCommentsByMirror:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video terrying-footage-shows-planes-trying-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStomach churning footage shows planes swept sideways during high winds as the pilots battle to get the aircraft down on the runway. The hair-raising air travel happened at Newcastle Airport and saw planes from EasyJet, Ryanair, Emirates and BMI blown to the side by the high winds. In one particularly frightening shot, a plane is moved metres to one side as it is blasted by a gust towards the end of the runway. The footage was taken by aviation enthusiast Jonathan Winton, , who watched as mph winds hit the aiport.   Mr Winton, a gardener from Alnwick, Northumberland, said: The winds didnt feel particularly strong at first but as we got a bit higher up they suddenly hit. Im a huge aviation fan so for me it was incredible to watch, but for those with a fear of flying it must have been pretty hair-raising. Storm Diana hit the UK this morning and is scheduled to bring torrential downpours, gales that could touch hurricane force and giant waves that threaten travel chaos and damage to homes until tomorrow.A so-called double-vortex super-tempest has most of the country under yellow weather warnings as strong winds and heavy rain threaten floods. Met Office forecasters have warned Scotland could be hit with up to mm of rain in just six hours, while a vast swathe of the UK will be hit by widespread strong winds of about mph.   While wind speed is the main factor air traffic controllers take into account when deciding whether a plane should take off, direction is also important. Headwind is preferred by pilots when taking off because it increases lt, which means less runway is required for the plane to become airborne. It also eases touchdown by slowing ground speed. Tailwinds can also be advantageous as they give aircraft a boost, cutting travel time and saving fuel.

They face the prospect of empty cupboards and a struggle to provide meals for themselves or their loved ones. Tesco wants to help people in need this Christmas so thats why its working with The Trussell Trust and FareShare to make this happen. Today the supermarket is launching its Food Collection campaign - the UKs largest food drive - and inviting customers to donate long-le food for those less fortunate. Its taking place in all Tesco stores across the country from today until Saturday December . And doing your bit is as simple as popping a few extra items to your shopping basket. All you need to do is take the shopping list below into your local Tesco store, pick the items you want to donate, and leave them at the in-store food collection point.  Tesco has also pledged to top up all customer donations by  per cent, so charities get even more help to pass on to those who can really benefit from it. Some stores collect for their local Trussell Trust foodbank, who deliver emergency food parcels to local people. Others collect for their regional FareShare depot, who redistribute to community groups and local charities. Donations to The Trussell Trust’s foodbank network go towards emergency food parcels for people who can’t feed themselves and their families. Items collected for FareShare are distributed to charities and community groups who provide meals for vulnerable groups like isolated older people or those in homeless shelters.  No matter where you donate, every can and every packet helps, and all the food you give will help people in need. Last year’s Food Collection campaign contributed over m meals to people in need, and Tesco is hoping this year will provide even more. Your trip to the checkout this weekend could be the dference between someone in your community being happy, not hungry this Christmas There are many reasons why people find themselves in this situation, from receiving an unexpected bill when on a low income to being alone and struggling to fight an addiction.

An ad for the property, which appears on Realestate.au, reads: Perfectly situated on the bend of the Brisbane river, this is a unique opportunity to purchase into a tightly held community. Boasting uninterrupted views across to the CBD and beyond, this is ideally placed for buyers looking to downsize without compromise. But people on Reddit have noticed a glaring error in the photos, where locals are saying that the reality of the property is very dferent to the snap.  The brown snake [Brisbane River] hasnt been this colour for a long time, one user said. It appears that someone has edited the rivers murky waters into a stunning crystalline blue - which people think is hilarious as apparently the river never looks like that. An article by ABC last year even says that that experts agree on the reasons behind its murky colour - the fact its an estuary river has earned it the nickname the brown snake. Unfortunately for the photo editor, this fact hasnt escaped people on social media. Theyve also made some awkward mistakes - the blue colour that appears to have been used on the water has also been smudged onto a post on the jetty. Its overall not a brilliant Photoshop job.

The low-frequency seismic waves were detected by monitoring stations across the globe on November  and reverberated for  minutes before falling silent. Researchers have narrowed its origin to Mayotte, a small island of the coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The slow waves were similar to those typically seen after large earthquakes - but scientists have ruled that out as an explanation as no corresponding tremors were identied nearby. Other theories suggest that the noise could have been the result of an undetected meteor strike   While one researcher told MailOnline that the trembling was almost certainly caused by a low-level underwater volcanic eruption. But there is little evidence thus far to back up either claim as experts search for clues.I dont think Ive seen anything like it, Goumlran Ekstroumlm, a seismologist at Columbia University who specialises in unusual earthquakes, told National Geographic .The monotone ring was discovered by chance after after a New Zealand-based Earthquake enthusiast noticed unusual readings from the US Geological Survey.  The expert, who goes by the Twitter name @matarikipax, wrote: This is a most odd and unusual seismic signal. Recorded at Kilima Mbogo, Kenya. The signal can be seen all around the world.The post sparked a heated debate amongst the community as waves were detected in Chile, New Zealand, Canada and Hawaii. The unusual signal was immediately discounted as an earthquake because it lasted for too long and because of its global spread. Earthquakes usually release a quick flash of pressure as the built-up tension is released in seconds. The founder of founder of UK Earthquake Bulletin Jamie Gurney stressed that the vent was unique and said he had no ideaa similar global signal of this nature has ever been observed.  Others pointed out the region has seen a number of small quakes since a small . magnitude earthquake hit the region on May . There has been ongoing low-level seismic activity there since May, seismic expert Anthony Lomax told the Mail. Inflation deflation and collapse of volcano calderas, and movement of magma under a volcano can produce a wide iety of seismic signals, including long period and repetitive waves like those observed November . Scientist are now planning to study the areas complex geology for more information about the noise but have not yet been able to pinpoint its cause.

We made a wee tinker to the shape not long after the game started because we knewthey went a certain way we had to.“We still looked threatening and that was the most important thing – he was part of that.“We got Paul McGowan playing his first game for a number of weeks, we’ve got Martin Woods who has not trained in a team environment for five months before he came here.“These boys are still getting up to speed, so the effort they put in was superb.”Dundee are idle this weekend because of the Betfred Cup Final and that means the gap to one of the two teams immediately above them will have increased by the time Hamilton Accies come to Dens tomorrow week.Saturday sees third-bottom Accies head for Paisley and a six-pointer against second-bottom St Mirren.If the Buddies can make it two wins in a row, it would see Dundee going into next week’s clash five points adrt in last place.Fans can get tickets for that and Sunday week’s Rangers clash for a cut-price £."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bfe72d0e4d99.jpg ","title":"dundees jesse curran puts scotland philippines and australia talk to one side","story":"Just four-and-a-bit months after breaking into the first team on a regular basis, and at ,  didn’t think he’d be deciding his international future.Already, though, the opening skirmishes have taken place in what’s become a two-way fight to secure his services.Andthe level of performance he put in at Hibs at the weekend that saw him praised by both managers on duty continues, a third country could soon be battling to tie him down.As was reported recently, the Philippines are making overtures to get Curran to commit to themand the midfielder has revealed representatives from the land of his birth, Australia, have also watched him.Last, but certainly not least, the fact he’s doing so well in the Premiership here might just see Alex McLeish want to persuade him to pledge allegiance to Scotland.At such an early stage of his career, and with no actual call-ups to any squads so far, he is taking nothing for granted.But while, for him, it’s just hugely flattering to be linked with a step up to international level, he admitsthat situation arises, it’s only after careful consideration that he’ll decide which country to pledge allegiance to.“I am just going to see how things unfold,” is the sensible answer he gives when quizzed about the matter.“I was asked to go to the Philippines training camp, not to commit to anything, just to see the facilities, meet the people and the staff and stuff like that.“It is a good opportunity, they’ve got the Asian Cup coming up in a couple of months so it’s something to look towards.“But I have the Socceroosto look to as well and Scotland too, so it’s a big decision. It’s a career decision so I am not going to rush into anything.“When I first started getting in the Dundee first team this season, the Socceroos came to one of my games and that was a big positive for me because I hadn’t been playing that long.“I will see how it plays out but it’s not something I expected to be thinking about right now. It’s great for me and, hopefully, I can just keep progressing.”Lightning quick on the pitch, when asked which of the countries would be his first choice, he shows he’s not slow either when it comes to coming up with a diplomatic answer.“I don’t really want to say. I’m from Australia and was brought up there so it would, obviously, be good to play from them.“But my dad is Scottish and my mum’s from the Philippines so they matter to me as well.“I just have to see who,anyone, comes for me and then take things from there.”The good news for Dark Blues fans is he’s fully focused on their team right now and helping with the fight to climb off the bottom of the top flight.And he’s convinced that draw at Hibs was the strongest evidence yet, in terms of both commitment and quality, Dundee have what it takes to do that.“To come back from - down to - is a great positive for us.“It was good, especially at a place like Easter Road because when Hibs get ahead they can control the game.“We had the chances to go and win the game, to be fair both teams did, so it was quite an entertaining game and it was a good game to play in.“Just a couple of balls in the final third let us down but we’ll work on that.“Obviously, St Mirren won at the weekend and the gap is three points but we are going to look at our performance and will keep working hard to make sure that’s how we play. We have to concentrate on ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b62caca727d8.jpg ","title":"dundee united to offer christmas day meal at tannadice to 120 lonely city folk","story":"Dundee United are offering a free Christmas Day meal to  lonely city residents.The Dundee United Community Trust is this year opening up the doors of Tannadice to local residents who may otherwise be on their own.The trust is working with The Ambassador pub in Clepington Road to extend the festivities, with more food and activities planned into the afternoon with the event running from am to pm on December .A club statement said: #We are also working on transport to assist with getting our guests to and from the event.#There are still places left and we would really encourage you to get in touchyou know of anyone who would benefit from coming along. Perhaps a neighbour or family friend who doesn’t get out much.#The community trust would also welcome donations from businesses or iniduals of gts that we can give to our guests to give them a fantastic Christmas Day.#Festive Friends is the result of cash raised from the Team DUCT Kiltwalkers earlier in the year and funding from the SPFL Trust.Should you wish to donate a gt, email the community trust at michael.malone@dundeeunitedct."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bfd1a57df2be.jpg ","title":"forgotten men mcmullan and edjenguele are making their mark under new dundee united boss","story":"It was ever thus in football, a new manager arrives at a club that’s been struggling and there’s an immediate revival.Often the turnaround in fortunes is, in part, down to the performances of players who were not involved under the previous boss.That’s certainly been the case at Dundee United, where a run of five wins and a draw under new gaffer Robbie Neilson has propelled them right back into the thick of the Championship promotion race.And that success has seen major roles for two men who, as recently as three months ago, who were not so much out of the first-team picture as the door at Tannadice.They are winger Paul McMullan and centre-half William Edjenguele and it’s fair to say, had conditions been right at the end of the summer transfer window, neither would even have been at the club when Neilson arrived last month.Former Scotland U  McMullan was particularly close to moving on at the end of August.Told he could move onhe could find another club, the final week of August did see talks held with interested parties and Partick Thistle were believed to be among those.Without revealing exactly who the clubs he spoke to were, McMullan has confirmed those offers from where and that he was close to going.In the end he decided, despite a lack of game time in the league, United remained a more attractive option.It’s a decision his new boss must be happy he made because under Neilson, he’s started every game and made a major contribution.He was Man of the Match in the win at Partick Thistle and his other starts have seen him heavily involved in the action as well.At Dunfermline he scored one, set up the other and found time to miss a penalty he’d won himself.The win over Queen of the South earlier this month saw him play a leading role again and have a hand in the move that led to Michael Doyle’s own goal that put United two up.At County he played his part in the rearguard action that secured three points, though the one black mark under the new boss came when he was booked for ing.There was no question of a e as he was brought down in last week’s win over Alloa for another penalty – having missed at Dunfermline – Fraser Aird took over the kicking duties from him.And such has been the -year-old’s contribution, it can be taken as read come the next transfer window in just over a month’s time, the only talks he’s likely to be having over his future are with the Tangerines. He’s out of contract in the summer but it looks a safe bet a new one will be on the table for him.Edjenguele is also a free agent next year and, at , it’s dficult to say where he will be playing his football come the   campaign.However,it’s where, it looks likely he will have moved on after playing a part in any success that’s about to come United’s way.Out of the league team since the opening-day defeat against the Pars, he’s had to wait for his chance.It came when Frederic Frans got injured in the warm-up prior to the Queen of the South win. A clean sheet in that one and another, part in thanks to a huge performance at the heart of the defence from the Frenchman, up at Ross County saw him retain his place for Alloa even when Frans was back fit.It could still be that over the course of the season he reverts to squad player status.Several times since his arrival the manager has stressed the contribution of those coming in when others are out through injury and suspension will be vital. Evenit’s just on that level, Edjenguele has shown he can have a part to play."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-council-could-ban-silent-discos-because-theyre-too-noisy","story":"A council could become the first in Britain to ban silent discos - after complaints they are too noisy."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds-of-jobs-to-be-created-in-30m-ayrshire-port-redevelopment","story":"Hundreds of jobs are to be created with the multi-million redevelopment of a Scots port and marine yard into a decommissioning and renewables hub."},{"url":null,"title":"world-famous-benihana-gears-up-for-city","story":"BENIHANA bosses have given Glasgow diners a first look inside the teppanyaki restaurant as it prepares to open in the City Centre."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-community-champions-2018-our-wonderful-winners","story":"Demi Mitchell, winner of the Sports Award: ldquoNo-one here tonight, no-one working in the third sector, does what they do because they want to win awards.

The same percentage is only repayablethe owner comes to sell the property.The buyer will typically contribute a % deposit when purchasing through the scheme – although some lenders may be able to offer % deposit mortgages – making home ownership more accessible to those who may have thought it out of reach.The groups which can benefit from the scheme include: first-time buyers social renters people with disabilities members of the Armed Forces recent Armed Forces veterans and widows and widowers of Armed Forces personnel who have been killed whilst serving in the past two years.Over s can also benefit from the scheme, but unlike other applicants there is no requirement for them to take out a mortgage to fund their contribution.Many people on low or moderate incomes do not believe that home ownership is a realistic option for them and continue to pay the high living costs associated with renting.However, with LIFT, buyers can secure mortgages which are often far more affordable than the monthly rent they are paying.Aimee Powell was a single, low-income earner who was renting privately due to her inability to obtain a large enough mortgage to buy a suitable home.Aimee found that home ownership was a viable option for her and ultimately took her first step onto the property ladder with the assistance of the LIFT scheme.She said of the scheme, “LIFT gave me the opportunity to become a home owner and create an investment in myself rather than throwing money away on rent.Without LIFT, I would not be a homeowner now.”Armed Forces personnel can also benefit from the LIFT, which has proven invaluable in securing suitable accommodation to help with transitions into civilian le.Shadrech Chipwatali was a serving Armed Forces member who was making plans for the future in advance of his departure from The Forces.A key part of his plans was to ensure that he and his family had a home suitable in terms of size and location.Shadrech’s vision became a reality when he applied to the LIFT scheme.He said, “This scheme gave us an option to get a house of our own when we least expected.As a member of Armed Forces, it is especially ideal as LIFT gave me an option to buy a house from an area of my choice. This means my transitioning from Army le to civilian is already sorted.”Countless others have benefitted from LIFT across Scotland, fulfilling their dreams of home ownership and building brighter futures for their families.From helping first-time buyers onto the property ladder, to helping people with disabilities into more suitable homes, LIFT can assist many of those who least expect to be able to buy a home.Link Housing Association administers the LIFT scheme throughout all  local authority areas in Scotland.For more information about the scheme or to apply today, please click here"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds of aberdeen residents sign up to save cash with new scheme","story":"Almost  Aberdeen residents have signed up to a scheme which allows them to boost their savings.The UK Government’s Help to Save scheme gives people an extra p for every £ they save up to £, – meaning they could get £, free.The account is available to people receiving Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit or Universal Credit and the latest figures show  Aberdeen residents have so far signed up.They have made a total of  payments and saved a total of £,.John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: “Savings shouldn’t be a luxury, they are an essential part of planning.“Whether you’re saving for Christmas or a much-needed family holiday, Help to Save is designed to make saving possible for everyone.”Help to Save is available by visiting gov.uk helptosave"},{"url":null,"title":"talks with bidders to conclude","story":"Discussions with firms vying to undertake the long-awaited revamp of Aberdeen’s Union Terrace Gardens are due to conclude next month.Aberdeen City Council is still searching for a firm to transform the sunken city centre park, with concerns the completion date of  may be missed.Councillors on the city growth and resources committee heard yesterday that discussions with a third bidder are due to conclude in December.Steve Whyte, the council’s director of resources, said: “We are currently in negotiations with the third bidder and they are due to conclude in December and we will report back in due course then.”A report to members of the committee told the tender period for bids has been extended “to allow the bidders to finalise their responses”.The project – initially priced at £ million – was planned to be completed by next July, but that was put back to summer ."},{"url":null,"title":"kenny pots title after long rest","story":"Aberdeen snooker player Kenny MacPherson has picked up his first singles title in over a decade.The -year old, who has been a fan of the sport since the age of eight, triumphed against top local players to leave with the  Moray Open.And despite having a relaxed approach towards competitive events, MacPherson admitted he was apprehensive ahead of the tournament.The victory was his first since picking up a handicap singles title in the Granite City a decade ago.Kenny said: “Two stand-out performers from Aberdeen were playing, who have dferent future ambitions with the sport compared to me.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13662436.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS168584632.jpg","title":"ayrshire sands mark 30 years","story":"NewsAyrshire SANDS mark  years of support and prepare for Christmas bauble serviceThe voluntary group has been offering an invaluable support network to bereaved parents across the county for three decades.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsSANDS team Marion Boyd, Jenner Stamp, Sarah Spiers and Alison McNeil \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThat they are needed at all is a matter of huge regret. But to those within Ayrshire SANDS, a common bond and desire to unite burns bright. Behind this voluntary group for bereaved parents lies many a heartbreaking story. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death organisation is there, in the first instance, to reach out to those in desperate pain. As a support network, mums and dads who have been in the darkest of places are often the very people best placed to act as rocks for those perishing behind them. But back in , when the Ayrshire branch of this inspiring group formed, few could have imagined the size of their task  years on. Local chair, Marion Boyd, explains: “Our first meeting had only a handful of parents and the whole topic of losing a baby was very taboo. “Thankfully the world has changed a lot since then, and people have become far more open about their loss. “But there’s no doubt that back then, you were not encouraged to speak about it.” For newly grieving mums like Marion, having a place to turn was not in the script of the s. And her experience – along with those of many others – has helped drive the st century changes to hospital support.  Marion, , said: “I had to share a room with another mum who had just given birth. “Watching her push her baby around and hear the cries of a newborn was heartbreaking. “But that was the reality back in those days. “It was almost like you had to dust yourself down and get back to normal as soon as possible. “Then there were the people who wouldn’t know what to say to you...so they’d maybe say nothing at all.” Marion and fellow committee members in the Ayrshire branch of the SANDS group are among Britain’s longest serving. Along with fellow parents, they have raised thousands during the intervening three decades and made friends through their grief. New facilities, latterly built at the Ayrshire maternity unit in Crosshouse, now give newly grieving parents their own space – with SANDS instrumental in their set-up. Treasurer Alison McNeil, , said: “Each of us has our own personal story which brought us together, and obviously they are very sad. “But through the years a special bond has grown between so many of the parents here. “Some of us have become friends for le and we’re just glad we can be here to offer support to others now. “But one stillbirth or neonatal death is one too many and it’s a sad reality that our group continues to grow like it does.” From the handful that began the journey in , so many more have passed through the hands of Ayrshire SANDS since then. And on Sunday, hundreds will attend the group’s annual bauble service at Prestwick’s St Nicholas Church. And such is the growing need for the team, they even have their own social media officer. Mum Sarah Speirs, , added: “The best thing is that nobody will judge you. “Ultimately, the only person who can truly understand what it’s like to lose a child is another parent who’s experienced the same thing.” And Marion said: “We were very keen from the outset that we had NHS involvement in the group. “We have an office on site at Crosshouse and work closely with midwives. “Perhaps they could have been wary of us at first, thinking that some parents would want to criticise them. “But they quickly realised that we are all here for the same thing and it’s a relationship that has worked very well. “Ideally the need for our group wouldn’t be there at all, but we’re just glad it can do some good.” •Parents wishing to attend Sunday’s service can bring their own bauble to hang on the Christmas tree.

Whilst providing a first-class service to her clients and the long hours spent in the office, Margo manages to achieve the perfect work-le balance for her family. This is one of the many reasons that she is one of just three finalists for Solicitor of the Year at the Law Awards of Scotland . The ceremony is this Thursdayat the Hilton in Glasgow. Growing up on the family farm in Maybole, Margo has been involved in agriculture since a young age and knew that her career path would lead her into the agricultural industry. Starting her legal career in the city, Margo worked at MacLay, Murray and Spens in Glasgow before moving closer to home at Howat’s Associates in Mauchline, to spend more time with her husband and two sons. Margo then moved to become a Partner at Lockharts in Ayr, and now heads up their Agricultural and Estates Team.

It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring.

A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas. Poppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them. The Mauchline Primary pupil created an informative poster to share with others about the commitment involved in keeping the four footed pals as pets.

Copper, Iggy, Skyler and Jasper are just a handful of the furry friends who make up the Wyllie’s colony.  Poppy decided to make her educational poster after she heard a horror story about a poor rescue bunny. She said: “It lived in a drawer for four years and that’s not fair.” Mum-of-two Elaine said: “I had read a story about a rescue rabbit and told the girls. “And Poppy saidshe could look after her rabbits then an adult shouldn’t be treating their rabbit that way. “She made a poster to raise awareness coming up to Christmas as she wants people to know how much care they need- so they are sure they are a suitable pet for their family. “She wants people to share so all bunnies have a good le and not just a good Christmas.” MBM Vets Mauchline have now shared Poppy’s poster online, urging others to spread the news of what rabbits “need to be healthy and happy”.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of

It was utterly disgraceful and incomprehensible.\"Defence lawyer Sophie Russell said that in the light cold light of day when her client was sober that he was \"very remorseful\".She added: \"When he has a drink in him he can become quite loud and inappropriate.\"The lawyer said the female would have been quite shaken at what had happened.Sherf Peter Paterson imposed a night time home curfew at Howdenburn Court, Jedburgh, between the hours of pm and .am as well as ordering Field to pay the female shop assistant pound, in compensation.He said:\"If you are back in court for an offence of this nature, the attempt to humiliate a female while under the influence of alcohol, you will go to jail.\"If you dont address your dficulties with alcohol then that is what is going to happen.\""},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-to-be-next-town-in-borders-to-get-new-school","story":"Galashiels is to be the next town to geta new high school.Officers are recommending the council spend pound.m on a cross-generational campus for Gala, which would be due to open in .Plans for campuses in Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles willthen follow in that order.However, the plans weremet with fury by opposition councillors from other areas, who claim their areas have been overlooked.Councillors also raised concerns over the cost of building four campuses, at a cost of poundm, over a -year period.At a meeting of Scottish Borders Council today, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer spoke out against Hawick being passed over in favour of Galashiels: ldquoWas there ever the slightest chance that Hawick or indeed any of the others would be next on the list ldquoThis is not about pitching Hawick versus Gala or Peebles or anywhere  itrsquos about fairness, itrsquos about need, itrsquos about a future for a community that is quite simply feeding from the bottom of the tank.ldquoHawick High School is not only not fit for purpose, but its current condition is an embarrassment to modern education and the youngsters and teachers who are required to attend this utter shambles are being let down by all in here who will not support them.ldquoAnd letrsquos be absolutely clear, with new high schools in Duns, Eyemouth, Earlston, and Kelso, and with work about to start in Jedburgh, when you agree this prioritisation for Galashiels today to you slam the door shut on any prospect of Hawick attracting teachers when they have a choice of modern versus old and dilapidated.ldquoThis action today is a further step in annexing the southern Borders and is not acceptable to those who deserve more from this council.Councillor McAteer then introduced an amendment, supported by fellow Hawick councillors David Paterson, Stuart Marshall and Clair Ramage, which asked for the council to delay its decision until a complete report had been submitted by education officers.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson and Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol also spoke out against the plans and highlighted the need for new schools in Peebles and Selkirk respectively.Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, who serves as leader of the opposition, cast doubt on the claim the council could afford to build four schools: ldquoThere is something financially unviable and deeply unfair in this paper,the costings and timings are added up for four campuses, then over  years you get an incredible poundm.ldquoWersquoll probably receive around half, and will have to find the other half.ldquoThere is no way that can be paid for, even in the unacceptable timetable of -plus years. Thatrsquos unfair to the Borders and unfair to Peebles, because so much would be spent on replacing primaries in other towns, that the high schools in Peebles and quite possible in Selkirk, would be kicked down the road.ldquoThe finance team are holding up a big warning sign, saying that to do even one campus, we would need to be up to our borrowing limit and wersquod need reschedule the current capital plan.ldquoItrsquos unfair to delude councillors and the public into thinking that four campus options, and community facilities are all financially realistic options.In response, council leader Shona Haslam rebuked claims the report unfairly favoured Galashiels: ldquoThis has been a robust process and deliberation, which has been undertaken with an open mind as to which town has the greatest need for a new learning facility, and recommendations have been made on that basis.ldquoItrsquos  to say that the consultation is incomplete, it has been completed, but further consultation is required.ldquoNo-one is pitching anyone against anyone. Only the councillors who have spoken in this debate are saying that.ldquoCouncillor McAteer, the door is not slammed on Hawick, and it is mischievous of you to suggest that.ldquoHawick is getting a new high school as quickly as humanly possible as this council is able to deliver it.ldquoIt seems strange that a councillor from Tweeddale is having to stand up in this chamber and say that Hawick is still a proud seat of learning.ldquoIt has a fantastic staff, and some fantastic people doing some incredible things. The Hawick High News is inspirational, and the only school in the Borders to do this, the debate team is a force to be reckoned with, and they do fantastic things.,params: .pushldquoIt is a proud, proud seat of learning and I canrsquot believe that a Hawick member would stand up in this chamber and say that itrsquos not.ldquoThere are three main reasons that Hawick High School kept hitting the national headlines, about a small number of unruly pupils, and those three reasons are councillor Ramage, councillor McAteer, and councillor Marshall.ldquoItrsquos a proud seat of learning and it will get a new high school as quickly as humanly possible.Councillor McAteerrsquos motion failed by  votes to , with Hawick and Hermitage councillor George Turnbull, who is a member of the Conservative Independent ruling coalition, voting against his own administration.The plans for Gala will see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate."},{"url":null,"title":"nasa-turns-to-private-sector-for-next-moon-mission","story":"Americarsquos next moon landing will be made by private companies, not Nasa.Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine announced on Thursday that nine US companies will compete in delivering experiments to the lunar surface.Mr Bridenstine said Nasa will buy the service and let private industry work out the details on getting there.Were ing to the Moon, to stay, and nine American companies will work on developing technologies to get there.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

Back in January, a Scottish Chamber of Commerce survey revealed that % of businesses were anxious about the rising costs of raw materials and their impact on prices.Responding to these pressures requires big ideas and new ways of doing business. And new ways of thinking are at the heart of the circular economy that Zero Waste Scotland is working with businesses across Scotland to deliver.We want to help build an economy where resources are valued. Itrsquos a message with an environmental heart but also a hard-headed business sense. As materials become more scarce and costs more prohibitive, the need to make sure we keep them in circulation for as long as possible and extract their full potential economic and social value becomes more urgent.But this challenge has also inspired some great creative thinking. Zero Waste Scotlandrsquos business support service is designed to help companies with big ideas explore more circular ways of doing business which can result in resource efficiencies, improved profitability, higher quality products, increased customer base and alternative supply chains for your business. This support has already helped more than  SMEs in Scotland.One business to benefit from this support has been EGG Lighting, who are working to reduce the waste in LED lighting. LED lighting is much more energy efficient than the old fluorescent-style lights that used to be common place in most commercial and industrial buildings. However, with the technology advancing at a rapid rate, regular upgrades are leading to high levels of material waste. What makes this all the more frustrating is that while entire units were being disposed of, the technological changes only affected a small part of the physical infrastructure.EGG Lighting had a smart solution to this problem. They designed a modular system that allowed businesses to keep using the same fittings and replace only the parts that were essential for accessing the new technology.For six months, EGG has been working with the Scottish logistics, construction and distribution specialists W H Malcolm to put their modular approach to the test. The trial has been supported by Zero Waste Scotland, with support from European Regional Development Funds and the Scottish Government.EGG is pioneering a service model that would see businesses continue to receive regular upgrades to the technology, but without having to replace the entire unit. That way, they get the benefits of the latest LED technology, without constantly forking out for new lights and without having to dispose of the entire unit.Zero Waste Scotland also offers support through the Circular Economy Investment Fund, which has delivered more than poundm in support to businesses across Scotland, again with support from the Scottish Government and the European Regional Development Fund. This funding has helped bring the latest D printing technology to Scotland, turn used coffee grounds into valuable bio-oils and kick start the creation of a transformational plastics recovery plant in Perth.From reducing costs to unlocking new markets, there are clear economic benefits in adopting a more circular approach to resources, products and services.

Multi award winning, including six Great Taste Awards from the Guild of Fine Foods, our Stornoway Black Pudding is made with Scottish oatmeal to give a unique texture and the moist deep flavour is a result of high quality ingredients and fine balance of seasoning.Essential in a traditional breakfast or perfect accompaniment to a range of savoury ingredients such as scallops, chicken, beef and pork.Black puddings arrived in Britain with the ious wave of invaders, which perhaps accounts for the iation between regions. Stornoway Black Pudding is unique in that it uses only the following ingredients in order of quantity beef suet, oatmeal, onion, blood, salt and pepper with the addition of water.

It was through stocking the deli with tempting speciality foods that Dawn realised that there was a gap in the market for tempting organic biscuits. Keen to make something that could travel beyond Mull, the Reades thought that biscuits seemed to be an excellent product to introduce to places beyond the islandrsquos shores.In  Island Bakery Organics was born. Initially the range had just  ieties. Quality not quantity! The first biscuit customers included Harvey Nichols andSelfridges. Within the first year the company picked up several Great Taste awards and scooped an Organic Food award.By , the biscuit side of business had overtaken the deli. Soon afterwards, plans were made to build a new bakery. The new premises were completed in June . Subsequently growth in the bakery has seen growth in product with  ieties now available including the acclaimed Island Bakery Chocolate Gingers where the biscuit cognoscenti are attracted to the generous chunk of moist stem ginger peeking out from beneath dark chocolate drapery, nestling on a subtly spiced ginger biscuit.For more information visit www.islandbakeryor follow them on Facebook or Twitter.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Isle of Mull CheeseLocated near Tobermory, Isle of Mull Cheese take great pride when it comes to producing a rich iety of finely crafted cheeses.Isle of Mull Cheese has the added benefit of being run on a small family farm on the island of Mull.

One way to indulge yourself is by picking up a treat from a re-use store. Zero Waste Scotland operates the Revolve standard for second-hand shopping.The Revolve standard is a quality kitemark that lets shoppers know they are buying high-quality goods from a reputable retailer and can expect an excellent customer experience. There are more than  certied Revolve stores and hubs that sell unique, pre-loved items such as childrenrsquos gts, bikes, white goods and furniture.But while the choice is growing, some people are yet to be convinced. A couple of years ago, we polled people to find out their views on second-hand gts.

But not all of its citizens are connected to the opportunities the city provides - which is placing a barrier on its growth potential.\"And its streets, particularly in the city centre, do not offer an experience worthy of a great European city, the consequence of decades of planning decisions which have prioritised car use over pedestrians and denuded its public spaces.\"The recommendations included in this report offer an opportunity to radically transform Glasgows city centre - ensuring it becomes an attractive place to live, work, visit and invest - while better connecting all its citizens so as to deliver inclusive growth.\"We have built on the very positive work already being undertaken by Glasgow City Council, such as the Avenues project, Low Emission Zone, cycling schemes and recently formed bus partnership.

Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, joins Marlene Shiels, chief executive Capital Credit Union, and Jessica Graham, member of Capital Credit Union, to promote the new campaign.\"  Our credit unions put people before profitsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rabbits in Bass Cemetery are to be gassed in an attempt to control the population.\"  Fury over gassing of rabbits at Bass viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school.

Dark skies have a le of their own. To gaze up at a clear night sky free of light pollution continues to leave me spellbound, unsuccessfully grasping for words to describe the unfathomable wonder of it all.“It is an absolute delight to celebrate the Dark Skies of Tomintoul and Glenlivet.” Prof Brown added: “Town-dwelling visitors who visit here will find their blood race when they find the sky to be black and flooded with thousands of brilliant stars rather than yellow grey and dotted with a few bright smudges.“Amateur astronomers will love what wonders the site offers through their telescopes and keen astro-photographers will be able to use extremely long exposure times to get fabulous images of faint cosmic objects. “On top of all this are the general wellbeing benefits associated with dark skies.“Suppression of unnecessary light improves human sleep patterns, saves money and can actually increase security.“It also retains the habitats of erse nocturnal wildle such as moths, birds, bats and even some mammals.”The four-year project is part of the Tomintoul and Glenlivet Landscape Partnership of land owners, community groups, local businesses and schools. ©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4836852.1543508965!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon travesty if voices shut out of brexit tv debate","story":"It would be a #travesty of democracy#a range of political voices are frozen out of a televised Brexit debate, Nicola Sturgeon has said.The BBC announced today that Prime Minister Theresa May had agreed to debate Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Sunday,  December.Mrs May has previously rejected calls for other political parties to take part in the debate.: Theresa May tells Nicola Sturgeon: Stop exploiting Brexit for Scottish independenceMr Corbyn is yet to agree to the debate taking place on BBC, indicating a preference for ITV’s Brexit debate proposal.The SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have all said they should be included.Ms Sturgeon tweeted: “If this or any Brexit TV debate goes ahead without all options, including that of remaining in the EU, being included and given a voice, it will be an absolute travesty of democracy.”Channel  presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy suggested the broadcaster would host a debate on Brexit that included “the actual options”.Mr Guru-Murthy wrote on Twitter: “Whatever happens Channel  will want to do the Real Brexit Debate - with the likes of Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon, Chuka Umunna debating the actual options.“I’m sorry to say this about esteemed colleagues, but the BBC ‘debate’ idea sounds like gimmicky crap.“The ITV ‘keep it simple’ thing is much more sensible.”: FMQs: Tories ‘exploiting’ independence to avoid Brexit questions©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4836834.1543507447!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit may s 3 hours in scotland show how hard she s trying to sell deal","story":"Theresa May#s stage-managed trip to Bridge of Weir was typical of a Prime Minister who makes meaningless gestures but ignores Scotland#s interests entirely, writes Tom Arthur MSP.The Prime Minister spent a grand total of three hours in Scotland yesterday.She’s not even trying to sell her Brexit deal hard. That’s because she knows it’s such a hard sell. In fact, nobody is under any illusion that Theresa May will get her Brexit deal through the Commons on  December. It is a bad deal and – for very good reasons – it lacks support in parliament.Her flying visit was stage-managed to the nth degree – a closed factory visit, no risk of encountering the general public and a handpicked media presence, with several journalists barred from the event for fear of tough questions being asked. The Bridge of Weir locals didn’t even know she was in town.So why bother Well, it is so typical of this Prime Minister to make meaningless gestures to Scotland while ignoring our interests entirely. In fact, ignoring Scotland has become the hallmark of her approach to this country over the past two years.Scotland, of course, voted overwhelmingly to Remain within the EU. We voted to maintain close ties with our European neighbours, the ability to trade freely, the freedom to live and work across the continent and to attract the talent we need to work in our communities, our universities and our health service.There has been no attempt whatsoever to respect that outcome. We have been ignored at every turn.But the SNP has been willing to compromise. We have been clear that we could accept remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union as the least worst option to protect Scotland’s interests – jobs, living standards and our economy.Again, this perfectly sensible compromise has been ignored at every turn.The Tories are now offering a completely  choice. Either we take the Prime Minister’s Bad Deal, which will make Scotland poorer, slice £ billion off GDP equalling £, per head of population, or we crash out of the EU with No Deal, which will similarly plunge the entire UK into chaos.: FMQs: Tories ‘exploiting’ independence to avoid Brexit questionsWhen neither of these options commands the support of parliament, when neither will leave the country better off, when both will damage the economy, impact jobs and harm our NHS, then surely it is high time to think again That is why the SNP will support any opportunity arising which allows us to respect the choice that Scotland made in  and protects our people from the damage of Brexit. We will support whatever option can garner enough support to defeat this Tory Government – whether that is a renewed opportunity to Remain in the EU through a second referendum or a Norway-style deal which keeps us in the Single Market.While the SNP is showing leadership amid the Brexit chaos, no wonder the Prime Minister is running feart and so keen to dodge questions. She’s the one responsible. Her party created the mess. It’s their mess to clean up.: Joyce McMillan: SNP faces huge decisions over Brexit and Scottish independenceTo each and every question over the turmoil she’s overseeing, and the grave consequences for Scotland, she pivots to the matter of Scottish independence.It is a puzzling tactic.In , Scotland was told that the only way to protect our future in Europe was to vote no to independence. That has now been exposed for the lie it always was.The only way Scotland can be sure that we are never again subjected to the democratic travesty that is Brexit is to become an independent country.We relish making that argument and gently suggest to the Prime Minister it ain’t her strong suit.The more day-tripping Tory politicians ignore Scotland’s interests, ignore our right to make decisions for ourselves and fail to respect those decisions we make, the more support for the SNP and independence will continue to grow.Tom Arthur is SNP MSP for Renfrewshire South and a member of the Scottish Parliament’s Constitution Committee©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835453.1543402440!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith we don t need an eu deal why are we bothering","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...I#m currently lying down in a dark room with a cool damp flannel over my forehead. I am suddenly all overcome with dizziness and sweats. Without time to see my doctor I have self-diagnosed using Google and Wikipedia that I am suffering a complete loss of nerve after agreeing with Prime #Minister Theresa May.She is right. It might be the only time and the only thing she is right about, but in a certain sense I am Bored of Brexit. Apparently this new phenomenon called BoB is neither a virus or congenital defect – I am simply pig-sick of the never-ending drawn-out EU negotiations that have lasted twice as long as Mao’s Long March.What’s more, no sooner have the EU  nations signed the orce settlementand have said we can’t change a single word, when – surprise, surprise – France’s President Macron is saying how he’ll bully and blackmail us so his fishermen get as much access to our fishing waters as they want.Bored of Brexit  You bet I am. I am bored with how we always cough-up our nation’s hard-earned taxes to keep the EU juggernaut hurtling between its two lavish parliaments.I’m bored with how we’re expected to sign up to new rules and regulations ­without a say in them. I’m bored with how EU politicians say there is a problem with the UK-Irish border are the same people who say that under no circumstances will they impose a hard border or any infrastructure – so what’s the problem I’m bored with being told we can have new trade deals – only to read QCs’ opinions that say it won’t be ­possible under May’s orce ­settlement and then hear President Trump agree, saying the US won’t do a deal now.It is this parade of our ­Premier May’s prize porkies that is the most boring aspect of it all. Every time she makes a claim about leaving behind the single market, its customs union, or those European judges, or ending unlimited immigration – I then find when I read the detail in the official documents that it is simply not true. These institutions are replicated and given new names, or there are caveats that keep us locked in –the EU leaders decide by themselves!One can only conclude the Prime Minister is trying to fool us by repeatedly parroting black is white or has talked herself into believing her own publicity without using her critical faculties – what is normally considered self-delusion. Neither of these behaviours are a good look.The prize example is the PM says that because we’re Bored of Brexit we must agree her orce settlement so we can move on to our new lives. This is the biggest lie of all. It is May’s withdrawal agreement that guarantees another two years of further negotiations until the end of  – with the threat of being kept in beyond that. French and Spanish leaders have made that very plain and the rest will be queuing up to give us another doing every other month. What we need is a clean break. To end the boredom we need to simply leave. The referendum question didn’t askwe wanted a new deal, it askedwe wanted to remain or leave – with or without a deal. We don’t actually need a deal – it’s how normal countries work. We can keep our £ billion for our own problems, trade with no ­tarfs to bring prices down and decide our fisheries’ future.

Reducing the supply of workers, while demand remained the same, would surely boost everyone’s pay packet – or so the argument went.But two reports yesterday – by the Bank of England and the UK Government itself – spelt out the folly of that apparently simple economic theory and, indeed, the folly of Brexit itself, which is shaping up to be one of the greatest deliberate mistakes by any nation at any time in history. The UK is one of the world’s wealthiest countries and, as a member of the European Union, had transformed its economy over the last five decades, until it was hit by the devastating blow of the  financial crash.That unwelcome bolt from the blue stemmed from overly complicated financial schemes that too few people genuinely understood but which were making banks too much money to prompt sufficient scrutiny of the potential dangers. A decade of austerity ensued. But now the UK risks deliberately plunging itself into an even worse recession. : No-deal Brexit warning from Bank of England: ‘Pound will crash and inflation will soar’If, as seems likely, MPs reject Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal with the EU, then Britain will be heading towards a chaotic no-deal Brexit.According to the Government’s new report, that could mean a fall in the UK’s gross domestic productof . to nine per cent –our departure from the EU has no effect on immigration.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all.

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

This coincided with much publicity given to a meeting with manufacturers and business leaders with the PM.“I took the opportunity to meet with some of these business leaders before attending the PM statement where I asked her a question on the political agreement. “Earlier I attended a debate about Bombardier redundancies and questioned the minister about the supply chain. “I got back home late on Thursday night and on Friday met with the chancellor and business leaders about the economy.“Yes it’s good to be back in Parliament doing the job I was elected by the people to do.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1271172.jpg--.jpg?1543325019000\n","title":"phenomenal response from public helps locate debbie","story":"PEOPLE in Ballymena came out in their droves recently to help locate a vulnerable dog who had been rescued from a puppy farm.  Debbie, a Cavachon, was rescued from a puppy farm in the south of Ireland and was bound for Ballymena to her foster home.However when the car she was travelling in stopped she got spooked and escaped.Volunteer for Cavaliers in Need, Lynn Kyle, said Debbie ran from Ballee to the Seven Towers roundabout before disappearing into the surrounding fields.This all happened on Friday eveningso we immediately put a call out on Facebook for people to keep an eye out for her, Lynn explained.The response was absolutely phenomenal. People went out to look for Debbie who had no knowledge of her.Debbie was missing all day Saturday and Sunday and as time wore on Lynn said she feared the worst.I knew because of my experience with dogs from puppy farms that they wont eat and will be terried of humans because they have been treated so badly in the past.We kept looking for her across the fields but there was no sign of her.On Sunday evening one of our volunteers came and put two animal traps down in the location where she was last seen.These traps dont hurt the dog they simply have a door which shuts behind them once they step inside.Thankfully Debbie came back to the area and was found in the trap in the early hours of Monday morning .Lynn told thethat she and other members of the Cavaliers in Need charity were so overwhelmed with the response from people in Ballymena.It was so heartwarming. “People didnt know anything about this dog but they gave up their weekend to go looking for her.The charity Lynn volunteers for are appealing for people to sign up and help in any way they can.If you have a passion for animals, a safe home and secure back garden then you could become a foster home.All the dogs we rescue have been treated in the most horrendous way.

It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings!

I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newly published childrens book aims to teach important message for a worthy cause","story":"A new children’s book, designed to introduce small children to the world’s big issues and aid vital charity work, is the latest work of West Belfast woman Arlene Gormley.Co-founder of the Feeding Dreams Cambodia charity, Arlene has penned, designed and illustrated ‘ Not A Fairytale’ describing how even from a young age we can work to make the planet better for now and future generations.Feeding Dreams Cambodia was founded in  and offers free education and nutrition for  children in Cambodia’s tourist capital of Siem Reap. The charity receives no government funding and relies solely on donations, most of which comes from support and fundraising drives in Belfast. Arlene explained how the book is based on the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goalsthat recognise ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education.“Our approach at Feeding Dreams is holistic,” explained Arlene. “ Our programmes in education, medical care, community support, vocational training, they are all interlinked, so when the UN announced the  Goals, it helped give us the framework and language for our strategy. Since each of our programmes can be tied to one of the  SDGs and the Cambodian government ratied the SDGs, it gave us legitimacy and credibility.”“I decided to create a handmade book introducing the SDGs to young children through colourful pictures with simplistic explanations. The book was originally intended as a keepsake for my four-year-old niece Zara but the message has struck a chord with parents and teachers. I’m holding a book launch on Saturday in the city centre’s Learning Space store and all sales from the book will go towards the work of the charity. “During the Christmas period people are very generous with their donations but it’s when all the rush calms down and we go into what we call our ‘leaner’ months of January, February that we need that extra push make sure all the children receive a proper, balanced meal.”Arlene became a mother herself in August and is now more determined than ever to ensure her daughter Julia has a keen understanding of the world around her.“Children are born into an uncertain and unequal world and parents worry about the kind of environment their children grow up in. It’s important to me that my daughter understands from a early age about important issues that will affect her future, like climate change, access to health and education, and the importance of equality.” The Queen’s University graduate spoke of how the visually striking picture book was “something a little dferent” for the bedtime hour. “It’s a great way to sit with a child and read each chapter, look at the illustrations, it’s a great tool to show what is going on in the world and at the same time contribute to the work of Feeding Dreams.”Arlene will be signing copies of her book at Fountain Centre’s Learning Space store on Saturday, December  from am until noon. Not A Fairytale is priced at £.

a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.The renewed challenge to the amended report focused only on issues around the extent of the legal powers to publish the findings.Counsel for the retired officers stressed it was not an attack on the institution of the Ombudsmans office.He argued, however, that damning determinations had been reached without his clients having the opportunity to respond.The Ombudsmans legal team countered that the PoliceAct gave him the required statutory power to make the determinations contained in his public statement.Backing that position, Mrs Justice Keegan stressed it must be histo investigate complaints. \"He also has power to refer complaints for criminal or disciplinary disposal and he can take other defined actions,\" she said.\"But it would be perverse to say that he cannot report on his investigation.\"Dismissing the legal challenge, she noted that the Ombudsmans statement does not constitute a criminal or disciplinary finding against any inidual.The judge added: \"In the unique situation presented by the Troubles it is appropriate that bereaved families should have the benefit of an independent investigative report such as this, particularly where no prosecutions have been brought.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed almost half of irish speakers only know basic terms","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It came after the Chief Constable raised concerns there was no mechanism to make temporary appointments to his senior command team permanent and he risked losing valuable staff to other forces amidst the continuing political deadlock. The Policing Board is the main oversight body for the PSNI and is made up of members including  political representatives.On Thursday, Karen Bradley confirmed the political appointments of Keith Buchanan, Joanne Bunting, Gary Middleton, Mervyn Storey from the DUP. Gerry Kelly, Linda Dillon, Philip McGuigan for Sinn Fein. John Blair for Alliance, Dolores Kelly for the SDLP and Alan Chambers for the UUP. Mrs Bradley said she would be engaging with local parties urgently in order to work on the restoration of power sharing. \"I am pleased to make these appointments to the Northern Ireland Policing Board to ensure that this important body can get back to work,\" she said.\"The Policing Board has a unique role in that it has primacy for policing accountability, but it also has an important advocacy role to play on issues that contribute to police service effectiveness, efficiency, partnership working and overall good policing. I am confident these new appointments will enhance the Board’s ability to fulfil this role.\"She added: \"In October , I introduced the Northern IrelandAct . The legislation enabled me to make key public appointments to a number of bodies including the Northern Ireland Policing Board.\"Whilst I am pleased to announce these appointment and we will continue to make the necessary interventions to ensure good governance and the delivery of public services, this can never be a substitute for local decision making. It would be much better for devolved ministers to be in place to make these decisions - including on key public appointments.!That is why I will be engaging the parties urgently, along with the Tanaiste in line with the well-established three stranded approach, to work to find a solution that gets the Executive restored and delivering for the people of NI.\""},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster tells prime minister to stop wasting time on brexit deal says dup open to norwaystyle deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, under a Norway agreement, the UK would have to accept the four freedoms of the single market - the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons - unless it could prove that be maintaining the principles it would face serious economic, societal or environmental strain and therefore opt out.The Norway premier, however, has said there could be dficulties in allowing a new member that would essentially be seeking to leave and it could take up to  months for talks on allowing it to become a member.Ms Foster says the DUPs \"one red line\" is to make sure Northern Ireland is not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and is \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.Asked why she supported a ergence from the UK in terms of same-sex marriage and not on Brexit changes, the DUP leader said that was because social matters were devolved to Stormont whereas customs and trade matters were for Westminster to handle."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland would not be stuck in brexit backstop permanently says theresa may","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -.

A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme. People in Saintfield are looking for answers to questions they have on the future development of the town.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

On average,  months after rollout, foodbanks see a % increase in demand, compared to % in areas with Universal Credit for  months or less.“All the evidence available suggests that the introduction of Universal Credit in new communities is swtly followed by hardship for struggling families. The introduction of welfare cuts has led to foodbanks being overrun and all politicians locally need to recognise the impact of welfare cuts it has on the people they represent. “The new welfare system is increasingly driving referrals to food banks due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.“The generosity of people who donate to the foodbanks and the volunteers who manage and distribute the food are an inspiration.“Unfortunately, the winter months are more dficult were foodbanks typically receive more referrals for emergency support and we need to redouble our efforts. “To express our gratitude, the SDLP will be doing our bit this Christmas to assist local foodbanks and doing all we can to help families under pressure.”Council staff visit aerosol paint sellers after spike in graffiti Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today.

Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.
