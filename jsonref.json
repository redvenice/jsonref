It was impossible to know who was in the photos.\u0027While she and her husband gently questioned their son, trying to find out if anyone had harmed him, he was too young to understand what was going on.\u0027He was a happy child and you just had to hope nothing had happened to him.\u0027Today, she says, her teenage son knows who George is, that \u0027the horrible lady\u0027 was in prison for abusing children and that he once attended the nursery where she worked, but he has never asked his parents directly whether he was one of those she targeted.\u0027He always moaned about going to nursery,\u0027 says the mother, \u0027and of course now I feel terribly guilty about that. Once, when were on the way there, he kept saying his leg hurt and I thought he was just making it up. Now we will never know if there was a more sinister reason.\u0027One incident in particular is still painfully etched on her mind.         George, who had been married for more than 20 years at the time she was arrested, took 124 obscene images of children on her mobile during a six-month period       \u0027I\u0027d arrived to pick him up and he\u0027d wet himself. Vanessa George asked if I wanted her to change him into his spare clothes before I took him home. I said yes.\u0027She finds it torturous now to think of her son lying on the changing mat where George abused many of her tiny young victims, sexually assaulting them with toothbrushes, crayons and even a plastic golf club.It is this poisonous legacy of uncertainty, says the mother, that makes her and other parents certain George is not fit to be released from prison.George, who had been married for more than 20 years at the time she was arrested, took 124 obscene images of children on her mobile during a six-month period. She shared them with two other paedophiles she met on the internet — Colin Blanchard, who was the lynchpin of the group, and Angela Allen.The trio, who had never met in person until they appeared in the dock together, egged each other on to abuse children and were only caught when one of Blanchard\u0027s business colleagues came across the explicit images on his computer.In court, where George pleaded guilty to seven sexual assaults on young children and six counts of making and distributing indecent images of children, her barrister claimed Blanchard had encouraged her to commit the abuse.That claim was rejected by Mr Justice Royce, who said: \u0027She is not a child. This is a married woman who can make up her own mind whether she indulges in this sort of activity or not.\u0027 He appealed directly to George, who described herself online as a \u0027paedo whore mumma\u0027, to reveal the names of the children she harmed.\u0027I would like your help,\u0027 he said, adding that she \u0027must know\u0027 who was in the photos. Speaking to her lawyer, he added: \u0027If I were a parent, I would want to know if my child was abused or not. Would it not be decent for her to indicate who she has abused?\u0027Plymouth MP Luke Pollard told the Mail this week that George\u0027s release was \u0027a dark day\u0027 for the parents whose children were once placed in her care, and one that \u0027reopened all the wounds of ten years ago\u0027.\u0027She\u0027s not just any criminal,\u0027 he said. \u0027She is Britain\u0027s most prolific female sex offender and she is still wielding power over these families by not naming their victims.\u0027Having been quietly released under licence from Bronzefield women\u0027s prison in Ashford, Middlesex, on Wednesday, George is believed to be staying in a probation hostel, at a cost to taxpayers of about £30,000 a year.Such hostels, managed by National Probation Service staff, each have between 15 and 20 bedrooms. Bathrooms are shared and the women are provided with three meals a day. George will also attend weekly meetings with a dedicated probation officer, at which she will be expected to talk about how she has spent her time and discuss her feelings, as well as the risks she faces on the outside.She is subject to strict conditions including a night-time curfew and a ban on using social media or owning any device with access to the internet. She is not allowed to return to Devon and Cornwall or to travel to a third county where one of her victims is believed to have moved, as well as 20 other exclusion zones connected to those affected by her crimes.She will never again be allowed to work with children or have unsupervised contact with them, and will be on the sex offenders\u0027 register for the rest of her life.Despite all these conditions, Luke Pollard said there were real concerns among families about how George\u0027s parole conditions will be enforced.\u0027The idea that in today\u0027s society they can keep her away from the internet for ever is ludicrous,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ve got to be certain that adequate resources are being made available to ensure there are no lapses.\u0027These parents have been through hell and now they have a whole new set of worries.\u0027The criminal justice system is not listening to victims. I want to see the rules around parole changed, particularly for those who refuse to name their victims.\u0027Such was the strength of feeling about George\u0027s impending release from prison that Mr Pollard had a meeting with Devon and Cornwall police, who subsequently re-examined their files to see whether further charges could be put to George so she could be kept behind bars.But officers were only able to find \u0027corresponding charges\u0027 — lesser charges relating to crimes of which she had already been found guilty. As these would not increase her sentence, no further action was taken.The contradictory message sent out at the time of her sentencing — when parents were told she could be out in seven years but would probably be in prison for life — goes back to a policy brought in by the last Labour government.Sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPPs) were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett. The Home Office originally estimated they would imprison only 900 \u0027dangerous\u0027 criminals under such sentences.Those convicted would be given a fixed tariff like any other prisoner but could be kept in prison for as long as the Parole Board deemed them a threat to society.The maximum sentence George could receive for her crimes was seven years — but by giving her an indeterminate sentence, Mr Justice Joyce may well have believed she would be kept inside for much longer than that.Sentences of IPP were scrapped in 2012, amid claims they were violating human rights and causing prison overcrowding. As the numbers of IPP prisoners grew, more and more convicts demanded access to the rehabilitation and resettlement programmes they had to undertake to show they were no longer a risk to society.There were claims, too, that such sentences were affecting prisoners\u0027 mental health, with a report by the Prison Reform Trust stating that IPP prisoners suffered the highest rates of self-harm in prison.Last year, Sam Gyimah, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Prisons and Probation, said the Government was focused on increasing the number of IPP prisoners released by processing their cases \u0027as quickly as possible\u0027.In March this year, 2,400 such prisoners remained. Of those, 43 —including George — were women.The decision to release her was taken after a Parole Board hearing in July this year which determined that she was safe to be freed from jail, after she convinced them that she had undergone treatment for her low self-esteem.The board noted how \u0027all the professional witnesses recommended that Ms George be released\u0027.But is it possible that George — who now goes by her maiden name, Vanessa Marks — is no longer a threat to the public? The families of the children she once cared for don\u0027t think so.Victims\u0027 rights campaigner Harry Fletcher says George\u0027s apparent lack of remorse means her release is \u0027worrying\u0027.\u0027Scores of parents in the areas where she worked don\u0027t know whether their child was a victim,\u0027 he says. \u0027The prison system should have taken that into account. Given the enormity of what she did, her sentence was grossly inadequate.\u0027Mr Fletcher said he understood ministers were urgently looking at George\u0027s case with a view to changing guidelines on sentence length.Given the level of hatred directed at her, it is hard to imagine how George will be able to revert to anything resembling a normal life.She is unable to return to the South West of England, the only place she ever lived before going to jail, and was orced by her husband Andrew shortly after being sent to prison. She is estranged from their two daughters, who are now adults, and her parents are dead.For those affected by her crimes, George\u0027s wellbeing is of no concern. \u0027I hope her life is torture because that\u0027s what she\u0027s done to us,\u0027 says the father who spoke to the Mail this week.Families with connections to Little Ted\u0027s Nursery have spent the past decade trying to put the horror of her crimes behind them. That the monster who preyed on their children is back out on the streets again is, for them, the greatest injustice of all.Additional reporting: Izzy Ferris"},{"url":null,"title":"Family quiet hero refuses charge elderly says nice good","story":"Share this article Mother to Annalise, 13 and Thomas, 11, from her first marriage, Barbara was left with severe disabilities, after breaking her back when she was mowed down by a car aged 18. Together they formed a contented and close \u0027patchwork family\u0027, but their happiness was almost destroyed when the couple\u0027s son William died in 2013 at 16 weeks old following a bowel operation. Born prematurely, weighing just 1lb 13oz and with a heart defect, his loss devastated the Andersons. Pictures of their boy decorate their home, and they have created a memorial in their front garden.However, far from retreating from the world, consumed with grief, this tragedy — and Barbara\u0027s own experience of disability — inspired them to help others instead.Mr Anderson was earning about £30,000 a year when two years ago he decided to launch a non-profit Community Initiative Company called Depher — Disabled and Elderly Plumbing and Heating Emergency Response.As far as he is aware, it is the only plumbing business of its kind in the world, reliant on donations and grants to offer free or discounted services to needy customers.The idea was sparked after Mr Anderson saw an elderly disabled man poorly treated by another engineer, who\u0027d landed him with a hefty repair bill and a £5,500 quote for a new boiler which wasn\u0027t necessary.\u0027The next day I couldn\u0027t get this gentleman out of my head,\u0027 he says. \u0027I was furious with the way he\u0027d been treated. I thought: \u0027If this has happened to him, it\u0027s probably happening all over the UK.\u0027 That\u0027s when I decided I had to do something.\u0027Mr Anderson spoke to his accountant, who registered his new non-profit company, and he used the money from his regular plumbing jobs to finance the free ones.But with elderly vulnerable customers making up 90 per cent of his workload in the winter, compared with 25 per cent in the summer, there was a shortfall in funding so he raised £77,000 through crowd-funding and received other donations, including a £2,000 grant from the Duchy of Lancaster.\u0027Since then, we have done 2,389 jobs for elderly and disabled — mostly it\u0027s free, but if we don\u0027t have the funds then it\u0027s discounted by 25 or 50 per cent,\u0027 he says proudly.\u0027When I started out as a plumber, I just went for the best paid jobs, but now I take home £100 a week, which I give straight to Barbara. Everything else goes into the company or paying off the £8,000 debt.\u0027Though they live in a mortgage-free home paid for by Barbara\u0027s compensation from her accident and mostly exist on her disability benefits, it\u0027s been a tough two years, financially and emotionally.Daughter Paige, 24, says: \u0027I am really proud of my Dad, but it\u0027s also been hard to sit and watch my parents struggle through all the sacrifices they\u0027ve had to make.\u0027Barbara adds: \u0027James was very down when he started to receive death threats and told me \u0027Perhaps I should give it up\u0027. But it\u0027s something he has to do and I never tried to stop him, even though it was frightening.\u0027Of his decision to carry on, despite the threats, James says: \u0027There were always going to be some people who thought I was too good to be true or out to take away their livelihoods. But it\u0027s not about me.\u0027Since James was dubbed \u0027Britain\u0027s kindest plumber\u0027 he has been overwhelmed by the response. One company has offered him free business insurance, worth £2,000 a year, Reliance Bank has offered free lifetime banking for his business and others have offered free holidays.He says hundreds of tradespeople have been in touch offering their services for free, too, and a London firm wants to discuss joining forces to expand his idea nationwide.Abroad too, James\u0027 selflessness is inspiring others, with people in the U.S., France and Australia wanting to exchange ideas and set up similar companies. His vision is for free plumbing for every single vulnerable, elderly or disabled person in the UK.He says: \u0027I spoke to a woman from North Wales just yesterday who had an engineer quote her £2,500 to take out a toilet, put in three pieces of floorboard and then put the same toilet back. I was disgusted, so I told her: \u0027Give me 14 days and ring me back and if I\u0027ve got enough funds, I will do it.\u0027On call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Barbara laughs when she says the downside of being married to the nation\u0027s most caring tradesman is that he\u0027s too busy to fix their own dripping taps.\u0027It takes him a long time to do anything at home,\u0027 she says, adding: \u0027And when he does, he cuts corners so he can get back to the customers who need him.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Nancy Pelosi demands new law make possible INDICT sitting president","story":"Share this article          President Donald Trump was insulated by DOJ guidelines that state a sitting president can\u0027t be prosecuted.

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

Here, it is the enclosure of the commons, a fulcrum of English history, that drives his story of dispossession and displacement. Set in a village without a name, the narrative dramatises what it’s like to see the world you know come to an end, in a severance of the connection between people and land that has deep relevance for our time of climate crisis and forced migration.Read the reviewMelancholic and transcendent, Chiang’s eight, high-concept sci-fi stories exploring the nature of language, maths, religion and physics racked up numerous awards and a wider audience when ‘Story of Your Life’ was adapted into the 2016 film Arrival. Read the reviewAn eye-opening study, based on overwhelming evidence, which revealedthat among rich countries, the “more equal societies almost always dobetter” for all. Growth matters less than inequality, the authorsargued: whether the issue is life expectancy, infant mortality, crimerates, obesity, literacy or recycling, the Scandinavian countries,say, will always win out over, say, the UK. Read the reviewJemisin became the first African American author to win the best novel category at the Hugo awards for her first book in the Broken Earth trilogy. In her intricate and richly imagined far future universe, the world is ending, ripped apart by relentless earthquakes and volcanoes. Against this apocalyptic backdrop she explores urgent questions of power and enslavement through the eyes of three women. “As this genre finally acknowledges that the dreams of the marginalised matter and that all of us have a future,” she said in her acceptance speech, “so will go the world. (Soon, I hope.)”Makina sets off from her village in Mexico with a package from a local gangster and a message for her brother, who has been gone for three years. The story of her crossing to the US examines the blurring of boundaries, the commingling of languages and the blending of identities that complicate the idea of an eventual return. Read the reviewThe Nobel laureate’s unexpected bestseller, on the minutiae of decision-making, ides the brain into two. System One makes judgments quickly, intuitively and automatically, as when a batsman decides whether to cut or pull. System Two is slow, calculated and deliberate, like long ision. But psychologist Kahneman argues that, although System Two thinks it is in control, many of our decisions are really made by System One. Read the reviewIn this existential eco-thriller, a William Blake-obsessed eccentric investigates the murders of men and animals in a remote Polish village. More accessible and focused than Flights, the novel that won Tokarczuk the Man International Booker prize, it is no less profound in its examination of how atavistic male impulses, emboldened by the new rightwing politics of Europe, are endangering people, communities and nature itself. Read the reviewIn this savagely beautiful novel set during the Indian wars and American civil war, a young Irish boy flees famine-struck Sligo for Missouri. There he finds lifelong companionship with another emigrant, and they join the army on its brutal journey west, laying waste to Indian settlements. Viscerally focused and intense, yet imbued with the grandeur of the landscape, the book explores love, gender and survival with a rare, luminous power.Read the reviewLos Angeles Times journalist Barbara Demick interviewed around 100 North Korean defectors for this propulsive work of narrative non-fiction, but she focuses on just six, all from the north-eastern city of Chongjin – closed to foreigners and less media-ready than Pyongyang. North Korea is revealed to be rife with poverty, corruption and violence but populated by resilient people with a remarkable ability to see past the propaganda all around them. Read the reviewAn agenda-setting book that is devastating about the extent to which big tech sets out to manipulate us for profit. Not simply another expression of the “techlash”, Zuboff’s ambitious study identifies a new form of capitalism, one involving the monitoring and shaping of our behaviour, often without our knowledge, with profound implications for democracy. “Once we searched Google, but now Google searches us.” Read the reviewAt the time when Ware won the  first book award, no graphic novel had previously won a generalist literary prize. Emotional and artistic complexity are perfectly poised in this account of a listless 36-year-old office dogsbody who is thrown into an existential crisis by an encounter with his estranged dad. Read the reviewSheba, a middle-aged teacher at a London comprehensive, begins an affair with her 15-year-old student - but we hear about it from a fellow teacher, the needy Barbara, whose obsessive nature drives the narrative. With shades of Patricia Highsmith, this teasing investigation into sex, class and loneliness is a dark marvel.Read the reviewThe Spanish master examines chance, love and death in the story of an apparently random killing that gradually reveals hidden depths. Marías constructs an elegant murder mystery from his trademark labyrinthine sentences, but this investigation is in pursuit of much meatier questions than whodunnit. Read the reviewThe master of the cold war thriller turned his attention to the new world order in this chilling investigation into the corruption powering big pharma in Africa. Based on the case of a rogue antibiotics trial that killed and maimed children in Nigeria in the 1990s, it has all the dash and authority of his earlier novels while precisely and presciently anatomising the dangers of a rampant neo-imperialist capitalism. Read the reviewIf the western literary canon is founded on Homer, then it is founded on women’s silence. Barker’s extraordinary intervention, in which she replays the events of the Iliad from the point of view of the enslaved Trojan women, chimed with both the #MeToo movement and a wider drive to foreground suppressed voices. In a world still at war, it has chilling contemporary resonance.Read the reviewA theoretical physicist opens a window on to the great questions of the universe with this 96-page overview of modern physics. Rovelli’s keen insight and striking metaphors make this the best introduction to subjects including relativity, quantum mechanics, cosmology, elementary particles and entropy outside of a course in advanced physics. Read the reviewThe deliciously dark US crime thriller that launched a thousand imitators and took the concept of the unreliable narrator to new heights. A woman disappears: we think we know whodunit, but we’re wrong. Flynn’s stylishly written portrait of a toxic marriage set against a backdrop of social and economic insecurity combines psychological depth with sheer unputdownable flair.Read the reviewWritten after a near-fatal accident, this combination of memoir and masterclass by fiction’s most successful modern storyteller showcases the blunt, casual brilliance of King at his best. As well as being genuinely useful, it’s a fascinating chronicle of literary persistence, and of a lifelong love affair with language and narrative.Read the reviewHenrietta Lacks was a black American who died in agony of cancer in a “coloured” hospital ward in 1951. Her cells, taken without her knowledge during a biopsy, went on to change medical history, being used around the world to develop countless drugs. Skloot skilfully tells the extraordinary scientific story, but in this book the voices of the Lacks children are crucial – they have struggled desperately even as billions have been made from their mother’s “HeLa” cells. Read the reviewThe fourth of the autobiographical Patrick Melrose novels finds the wealthy protagonist – whose flight from atrocious memories of child abuse into drug abuse was the focus of the first books – beginning to grope after redemption. Elegant wit and subtle psychology lift grim subject matter into seductive brilliance.Read the reviewA man drives his three sons into a deep pond and swims out, leaving them to drown. But was it an accident? This 2005 tragedy caught the attention of one of Australia’s greatest living writers. Garner puts herself centre stage in an account of Robert Farquharson’s trial that combines forensic detail and rich humanity.Read the reviewThis book-length poem is a mesmerising tapestry of “the river’s mutterings”, based on three years of recording conversations with people who live and work on the River Dart in Devon. From swimmers to sewage workers, boatbuilders to bailiffs, salmon fishers to ferryman, the voices are varied and vividly brought to life.Read the reviewOne of Canada’s most celebrated poets examines love and desire in a collection that describes itself as “a fictional essay in 39 tangos”. Carson charts the course of a doomed marriage in loose-limbed lines that follow the switchbacks of thought and feeling from first meeting through multiple infidelities to arrive at eventual orce.This grand survey of Europe since 1945 begins with the devastation left behind by the second world war and offers a panoramic narrative of the cold war from its beginnings to the collapse of the Soviet bloc – a part of which Judt witnessed firsthand in Czechoslovakia’s velvet revolution. A very complex story is told with page-turning urgency and what may now be read as nostalgic faith in “the European idea”. Read the reviewA love story to the golden age of comics in New York, Chabon’s Pulitzer-winner features two Jewish cousins, one smuggled out of occupied Prague, who create an anti-fascist comic book superhero called The Escapist. Their own adventures are as exciting and highly coloured as the ones they write and draw in this generous, open-hearted, deeply lovable rollercoaster of a book.Read the reviewA beautifully written and profound book, which takes the form of aseries of (often hair-raising and claustrophobic) voyages underground– from the fjords of the Arctic to the Parisian catacombs. Trips belowthe surface inspire reflections on “deep” geological time and raiseurgent questions about the human impact on planet Earth. Read the reviewAn entertaining and highly influential book from the writer best known for his advice: “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.” The author follows four meals on their journey from field to plate – including one from McDonald’s and a locally sourced organic feast. Pollan is a skilled, amusing storyteller and The Omnivore’s Dilemma changed both food writing and the way we see food. Read the reviewBased on Beard’s lectures on women’s voices and how they have been silenced, Women and Power was an enormous publishing success in the “#MeToo”’ year 2017. An exploration of misogyny, the origins of “gendered speech” in the classical era and the problems the male world has with strong women, this slim manifesto became an instant feminist classic. Read the reviewCarey’s second Booker winner is an irresistible tour de force of literary ventriloquism: the supposed autobiography of 19th-century Australian outlaw and “wild colonial boy” Ned Kelly, inspired by a fragment of Kelly’s own prose and written as a glorious rush of semi-punctuated vernacular storytelling. Mythic and tender by turns, these are tall tales from a lost frontier.Read the reviewPitted against a backdrop of prejudice, this London-set novel is told by four protagonists – Hortense and Gilbert, Jamaican migrants, and a stereotypically English couple, Queenie and Bernard. These varied perspectives, illuminated by love and loyalty, combine to create a thoughtful mosaic depicting the complex beginnings of Britain’s multicultural society. Read the reviewTóibín’s sixth novel is set in the 1950s, when more than 400,000 people left Ireland, and considers the emotional and existential impact of emigration on one young woman. Eilis makes a life for herself in New York, but is drawn back by the possibilities of the life she has lost at home. A universal story of love, endurance and missed chances, made radiant through Tóibín’s measured prose and tender understatement.Read the reviewIn the first book in her dystopian MaddAddam trilogy, the Booker winner speculates about the havoc science can wreak on the world. The big warning here – don’t trust corporations to run the planet – is blaring louder and louder as the century progresses. Read the reviewThe title is the question Winterson’s adoptive mother asked as she threw her daughter out, aged 16, for having a girlfriend. The autobiographical story behind Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, and the trials of Winterson’s later life, is urgent, wise and moving. Read the reviewPratchett’s mighty Discworld series is a high point in modern fiction: a parody of fantasy literature that deepened and darkened over the decades to create incisive satires of our own world. The 29th book, focusing on unlikely heroes, displays all his fierce intelligence, anger and wild humour, in a story that’s moral, humane – and hilarious. Read the reviewSatrapi’s autobiographical graphic novel follows her coming-of-age in the lead up to and during the Iranian revolution. In this riotous memoir, Satrapi focuses on one young life to reveal a hidden history.The Nobel laureate tends to the fragments of memory and loss with moving precision in his final poetry collection. A book of elegies and echoes, these poems are infused with a haunting sense of pathos, with a line often left hanging to suspend the reader in longing and regret. Read the reviewThe British novelist combines fiction and non-fiction to form a searing essay on grief and love for his late wife, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh. Barnes ides the book into three parts with disparate themes – 19th-century ballooning, photography and marriage. Their convergence is wonderfully achieved. Read the reviewWriting against “the tremendous despair at the height of the Bush administration’s powers and the outset of the war in Iraq”, the US thinker finds optimism in political activism and its ability to change the world. The book ranges widely from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Zapatista uprising in Mexico, to the invention of Viagra. Read the reviewFrom the slow emergency response in the black suburbs destroyed by hurricane Katrina to a mother trying to move her daughter away from a black passenger on a plane, the poet’s award-winning prose work confronts the history of racism in the US and asks: regardless of their actual status, who truly gets to be a citizen? Read the reviewThe author of The Big Short has made a career out of rendering the most opaque subject matter entertaining and comprehensible: Moneyball tells the story of how geeks outsmarted jocks to revolutionise baseball using maths. But you do not need to know or care about the sport, because – as with all Lewis’s best writing – it’s all about how the story is told. Read the reviewThere are echoes of DH Lawrence and EM Forster in McEwan’s finely tuned dissection of memory and guilt. The fates of three young people are altered by a young girl’s lie at the close of a sweltering day on a country estate in 1935. Lifelong remorse, the horror of war and devastating twists are to follow in an elegant, deeply felt meditation on the power of love and art. Read the reviewWith cold, clear, precise prose, Didion gives an account of the year her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, collapsed from a fatal heart attack in their home. Her devastating examination of grief and widowhood changed the nature of writing about bereavement. Read the reviewSet around the unlikely bond between two wartime friends, Smith’s debut brilliantly captures Britain’s multicultural spirit, and offers a compelling insight into immigrant family life.Oxford graduate Nick Guest has the questionable good fortune of moving into the grand west London home of a rising Tory MP. Thatcher-era degeneracy is lavishly displayed as Nick falls in love with the son of a supermarket magnate, and the novel records how Aids began to poison gay life in London. In peerless prose, Hollinghurst captures something close to the spirit of an age. Read the reviewA reunion dominates the Irish novelist’s family drama, but the inidual stories of the five members of the Madigan clan – the matriarch, Rosaleen, and her children, Dan, Emmet, Constance and Hanna, who escape and are bound to return – are beautifully held in balance. When the Madigans do finally come together halfway through the book, Enright masterfully reminds us of the weight of history and family. Read the reviewKnown for the firecracker phrases and broad satires of his fiction, Amis presented a much warmer face in his memoir. His life is haunted by the disappearance of his cousin Lucy, who is revealed 20 years later to have been murdered by Fred West. But Amis also has much fun recollecting his “velvet-suited, snakeskin-booted” youth, and paints a moving portrait of his father’s comic gusto as old age reduces him to a kind of “anti-Kingsley”. Read the reviewIn this exquisite family memoir, the ceramicist explains how he came to inherit a collection of 264 netsuke – small Japanese ornaments – from his great-uncle. The unlikely survival of the netsuke entails De Waal telling a story that moves from Paris to Austria under the Nazis to Japan, and he beautifully conjures a sense of place. The book doubles as a set of profound reflections on objects and what they mean to us. Read the reviewThis startling work of autofiction, which signalled a new direction for Cusk, follows an author teaching a creative writing course over one hot summer in Athens. She leads storytelling exercises. She meets other writers for dinner. She hears from other people about relationships, ambition, solitude, intimacy and “the disgust that exists indelibly between men and women”. The end result is sublime. Read the reviewThe American cartoonist’s darkly humorous memoir tells the story of how her closeted gay father killed himself a few months after she came out as a lesbian. This pioneering work, which later became a musical, helped shape the modern genre of “graphic memoir”, combining detailed and beautiful panels with remarkable emotional depth. Read the review“Normal cells are identically normal malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.” In adapting the opening lines of Anna Karenina, Mukherjee sets out the breathtaking ambition of his study of cancer: not only to share the knowledge of a practising oncologist but to take his readers on a literary and historical journey. Read the reviewAn electrifying memoir that captured a moment in thinking about gender, and also changed the world of books. The story, told in fragments, is of Nelson’s pregnancy, which unfolds at the same time as her partner, the artist Harry Dodge, is beginning testosterone injections: “the summer of our changing bodies”. Strikingly honest, originally written, with a galaxy of intellectual reference points, it is essentially a love story one that seems to make a new way of living possible. Read the reviewA thrilling, genre-bending tale of escape from slavery in the American deep south, this Pulitzer prize-winner combines extraordinary prose and uncomfortable truths. Two slaves flee their masters using the underground railroad, the network of abolitionists who helped slaves out of the south, wonderfully reimagined by Whitehead as a steampunk vision of a literal train. Read the reviewThe first instalment of Knausgaard’s relentlessly self-examining six-volume series My Struggle revolves around the life and death of his alcoholic father. Whether or not you regard him as the Proust of memoir, his compulsive honesty created a new benchmark for autofiction. Read the reviewA moving, book-length poem from the UK’s first female poet laureate, Rapture won the TS Eliot prize in 2005. From falling in love to betrayal and separation, Duffy reimagines romance with refreshing originality. Read the reviewCanada’s observant and humane short story writer, who won the Nobel in 2013, is at her best in this collection. A housekeeper’s fate is changed by the pranks of her employer’s teenager daughter an incorrigible flirt gracefully accepts his wife’s new romance in her care home. No character acts as at first expected in Munro’s stories, which are attuned to the tiniest shifts in perception. Read the reviewThe beautifully written product of 15 years of research, Capital made its author an intellectual star – the modern Marx – and opened readers’ eyes to how neoliberalism produces vastly increased inequalities. Full of data, theories and historical analysis, its message is clear, and prophetic: unless governments increase tax, the new and grotesque wealth levels of the rich will encourage political instability. Read the reviewRooney’s second novel, a love story between two clever and damaged young people coming of age in contemporary Ireland, confirmed her status as a literary superstar. Her focus is on the dislocation and uncertainty of millennial life, but her elegant prose has universal appeal. Read the reviewInspired by both Proust and The Sopranos, Egan’s Pulitzer-winning comedy follows several characters in and around the US music industry, but is really a book about memory and kinship, time and narrative, continuity and disconnection. Read the reviewEmerging from Solomon’s own painful experience, this “anatomy” of depression examines its many faces – plus its science, sociology and treatment. The book’s combination of honesty, scholarly rigour and poetry made it a benchmark in literary memoir and understanding of mental health. Read the reviewThis warm yet biting collection of short stories by the Booker-winning American author will restore your faith in humanity. No matter how weird the setting – a futuristic prison lab, a middle-class home where human lawn ornaments are employed as a status symbol – in these surreal satires of post-crash life Saunders reminds us of the meaning we find in small moments. Read the reviewIn his Olympian history of humanity, Harari documents the numerous revolutions Homo sapiens has undergone over the last 70,000 years: from new leaps in cognitive reasoning to agriculture, science and industry, the era of information and the possibilities of biotechnology. Harari’s scope may be too wide for some, but this engaging work topped the charts and made millions marvel. Read the reviewAtkinson examines family, history and the power of fiction as she tells the story of a woman born in 1910 – and then tells it again, and again, and again. Ursula Todd’s multiple lives see her strangled at birth, drowned on a Cornish beach, trapped in an awful marriage and visiting Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden. But this dizzying fictional construction is grounded by such emotional intelligence that her heroine’s struggles always feel painfully, joyously real. Read the reviewFifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone becomes absorbed in the mystery of a dog’s demise, meticulously investigating through diagrams, timetables, maps and maths problems. Haddon’s fascinating portrayal of an unconventional mind was a crossover hit with both adults and children and was adapted into a very successful stage play. Read the reviewIn this urgent examination of free-market fundamentalism, Klein argues – with accompanying reportage – that the social breakdowns witnessed during decades of neoliberal economic policies are not accidental, but in fact integral to the functioning of the free market, which relies on disaster and human suffering to function. Read the reviewA father and his young son, “each the other’s world entire”, trawl across the ruins of post-apocalyptic America in this terrifying but tender story told with biblical conviction. The slide into savagery as civilisation collapses is harrowing material, but McCarthy’s metaphysical efforts to imagine a cold dark universe where the light of humanity is winking out are what make the novel such a powerful ecological warning. Read the reviewThe members of one ordinarily unhappy American family struggle to adjust to the shifting axes of their worlds over the final decades of the 20th century. Franzen’s move into realism reaped huge literary rewards: exploring both domestic and national conflict, this family saga is clever, funny and outrageously readable. Read the reviewThe science journalist examines with clarity and memorable detail the current crisis of plant and animal loss caused by human civilisation (over the past half billion years, there have been five mass extinctions on Earth we are causing another). Kolbert considers both ecosystems – the Great Barrier Reef, the Amazon rainforest – and the lives of some extinct and soon-to-be extinct creatures including the Sumatran rhino and “the most beautiful bird in the world”, the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui. Read the reviewMoving from the underworld dens of Victorian London to the boudoirs of country house gothic, and hingeing on the seduction of an heiress, Waters’s third novel is a drippingly atmospheric thriller, a smart study of innocence and experience, and a sensuous lesbian love story – with a plot twist to make the reader gasp. Read the reviewIn this modern classic of reportage, Ehrenreich chronicled her attempts to live on the minimum wage in three American states. Working first as a waitress, then a cleaner and a nursing home aide, she still struggled to survive, and the stories of her co-workers are shocking. The US economy as she experienced it is full of routine humiliation, with demands as high as the rewards are low. Two decades on, this still reads like urgent news. Read the reviewWhat if aviator Charles Lindbergh, who once called Hitler “a great man”, had won the US presidency in a landslide victory and signed a treaty with Nazi Germany? Paranoid yet plausible, Roth’s alternative-world novel is only more relevant in the age of Trump. Read the reviewPowerfully intimate and unashamedly domestic, the first in Ferrante’s Neapolitan series established her as a literary sensation. This and the three novels that followed documented the ways misogyny and violence could determine lives, as well as the history of Italy in the late 20th century.When Nigerian author Adichie was growing up, the Biafran war “hovered over everything”. Her sweeping, evocative novel, which won the Orange prize, charts the political and personal struggles of those caught up in the conflict and explores the brutal legacy of colonialism in Africa. Read the reviewThe epic that made Mitchell’s name is a Russian doll of a book, nesting stories within stories and ning centuries and genres with aplomb. From a 19th-century seafarer to a tale from beyond the end of civilisation, via 1970s nuclear intrigue and the testimony of a future clone, these dizzying narratives are delicately interlinked, highlighting the echoes and recurrences of the vast human symphony.Read the reviewSmith began writing her Seasonal Quartet, a still-ongoing experiment in quickfire publishing, against the background of the EU referendum. The resulting “first Brexit novel” isn’t just a snapshot of a newly ided Britain, but a dazzling exploration into love and art, time and dreams, life and death, all done with her customary invention and wit. Read the reviewCoates’s impassioned meditation on what it means to be a black American today made him one of the country’s most important intellectuals and writers. Having grown up the son of a former Black Panther on the violent streets of Baltimore, he has a voice that is challenging but also poetic. Between the World and Me takes the form of a letter to his teenage son, and ranges from the daily reality of racial injustice and police violence to the history of slavery and the civil war: white people, he writes, will never remember “the scale of theft that enriched them”. Read the reviewChildren’s fiction came of age when the final part of Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy became the first book for younger readers to win the Whitbread book of the year award. Pullman has brought imaginative fire and storytelling bravado to the weightiest of subjects: religion, free will, totalitarian structures and the human drive to learn, rebel and grow. Here Asriel’s struggle against the Authority reaches its climax, Lyra and Will journey to the Land of the Dead, and Mary investigates the mysterious elementary particles that lend their name to his current trilogy: The Book of Dust. The Hollywood-fuelled commercial success achieved by JK Rowling may have eluded Pullman so far, but his sophisticated reworking of Paradise Lost helped adult readers throw off any embarrassment at enjoying fiction written for children – and publishing has never looked back. Read the reviewSebald died in a car crash in 2001, but his genre-defying mix of fact and fiction, keen sense of the moral weight of history and interleaving of inner and outer journeys have had a huge influence on the contemporary literary landscape. His final work, the typically allusive life story of one man, charts the Jewish disapora and lost 20th century with heartbreaking power. Read the reviewFrom his 1989 Booker winner The Remains of the Day to 2015’s The Buried Giant, Nobel laureate Ishiguro writes profound, puzzling allegories about history, nationalism and the inidual’s place in a world that is always beyond our understanding. His sixth novel, a love triangle set among human clones in an alternative 1990s England, brings exquisite understatement to its exploration of mortality, loss and what it means to be human. Read the reviewThe Belarusian Nobel laureate recorded thousands of hours of testimony from ordinary people to create this oral history of the Soviet Union and its end. Writers, waiters, doctors, soldiers, former Kremlin apparatchiks, gulag survivors: all are given space to tell their stories, share their anger and betrayal, and voice their worries about the transition to capitalism. An unforgettable book, which is both an act of catharsis and a profound demonstration of empathy.Robinson’s meditative, deeply philosophical novel is told through letters written by elderly preacher John Ames in the 1950s to his young son who, when he finally reaches an adulthood his father won’t see, will at least have this posthumous one-sided conversation: “While you read this, I am imperishable, somehow more alive than I have ever been.” This is a book about legacy, a record of a pocket of America that will never return, a reminder of the heartbreaking, ephemeral beauty that can be found in everyday life. As Ames concludes, to his son and himself: “There are a thousand thousand reasons to live this life, every one of them sufficient.” Read the reviewMantel had been publishing for a quarter century before the project that made her a phenomenon, set to be concluded with the third part of the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, next March. To read her story of the rise of Thomas Cromwell at the Tudor court, detailing the making of a new England and the self-creation of a new kind of man, is to step into the stream of her irresistibly authoritative present tense and find oneself looking out from behind her hero’s eyes. The surface details are sensuously, vividly immediate, the language as fresh as new paint but her exploration of power, fate and fortune is also deeply considered and constantly in dialogue with our own era, as we are shaped and created by the past. In this book we have, as she intended, “a sense of history listening and talking to itself”.Read the review• To order any of these titles go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Constance Holden is a reclusive novelist with a formidable reputation who has published nothing for more than 30 years. Now in her 70s and crippled with osteoarthritis, she employs a young woman called Laura Brown as a housekeeper and secretary. Laura assures her that she’s the patient type. “Then I’ll call you the patient typist,” Constance replies.Readers of Burton’s fiction may notice the continuation of a theme, as The Muse similarly began with a young woman being employed as a typist by an inscrutable female art historian. It’s perhaps also worth noting that Burton herself worked as a PA in the City before the publication in 2014 of her million-selling debut, The Miniaturist, so has first-hand experience of supporting herself in a menial role while quietly composing a piece of art.The Confession also follows The Muse in establishing a dual time-frame. Episodes set in the present day illustrate Constance’s increasing dependency on Laura as she struggles to break her silence with a new book. These passages are interleaved with scenes from the early 1980s when Constance was at the height of her fame, the author of two influential novels and a much-cited essay on female empowerment. Throughout this halcyon period of large advances and Hollywood film offers, Constance’s closest companion was her lover Elise Morceau a young, waif-like woman she met while walking on Hampstead Heath in north London.Elise is the novel’s most enigmatic character: a neurotic drifter who both feeds off and resents Constance’s growing celebrity. She becomes increasingly depressed and detached when Constance moves to the US to pursue her ambitions of becoming a player in the movie industry. Then Elise simply disappears, absconding from a filthy Brooklyn apartment leaving a newborn baby behind. The only certain fact is that, immediately prior to her disappearance, Elise received a final visit from Constance.While The Muse was a novel about the creative drive of painters, The Confession is a meditation on fiction and the compulsion to invent alternative realities. Not only does Constance spend much time theorising on the mechanics of her craft, her helpmeet “Laura Brown” is also an act of pure self-invention. From the outset the reader is made aware that “Laura” is really Rose Simmons, the baby abandoned by Elise, who has worked her way into Constance’s confidence in the hope of extracting information from the last person to have seen her mother alive.RoseLaura seems to have inherited most of her mother’s insecurities she works shifts in a coffee shop and is tethered to a hopeless partner whose burrito van business has stalled. Helping Constance not only brings her closer to her mother, it enables the elaborate fabrication of a more fascinating, less flawed version of herselfThough The Confession does not extend as far into the past as her previous books, Burton deploys her characteristically piquant sense of period detail. The Miniaturist was dominated by the image of sugar fermenting in a damp warehouse, creating a cloying sense of 17th-century Amsterdam’s fortunes on the turn. Burton is equally adept at evoking London and Los Angeles on the crest of yuppie decadence: “Women with heavy eyeliner wearing velvet dresses with warrior shoulders, rubbing against tired City boys and men whose long hair flowed from fashionable hats. Denim, leather, nicotine, money – Elise could almost taste them on her tongue like elementals.”What one notices here, however, is a more free-flowing aspect to her prose, which is plainer and less obstructed by overworked passages than her earlier work. Perhaps this new sense of liberation has been prompted by having produced her first book for children, The Restless Girls a retelling of the Brothers Grimm fairytale “The Twelve Dancing Princesses” with a racy new slant. Like RoseLaura, the princesses are mourning the loss of a mother, who has been killed in a bizarre racing car accident. Kept under lock and key by an overprotective father, they are ultimately redeemed by the restorative power of storytellingThe Confession perhaps lacks the dramatic thrust of The Muse and The Miniaturist it is quite a slow build to the revelation promised by the title.

Dutch media has called it “organised crime in pinstripe suits” and one of the original German whistleblowers saying he now welcomes Britain’s exit from the EU in the hope it could weaken the influence of London investment banking on European financial institutions.This week, a British former investment banker involved in developing the scheme for the first time gave the public an insight into how the scheme worked and what spurred on its architects.Speaking at a regional court in Bonn, Martin Shields, one of two former bankers on trial for 34 instances of serious tax fraud between 2006 and 2011, painted a picture of a London banking scene which lured in the brightest scientists from the country’s top universities and used them to boost their profit margins – without teaching them about the moral and legal consequences of their actions in return.A cum-ex deal, from the Latin meaning with-without, is a complex set of share transactions with the purpose of getting the state to reimburse a tax that was never paid in the first place.Cum-ex transactions work by trading shares at high speed on or just before the idend record date – the day the company checks its records to identify shareholders – and then claiming two or more refunds for capital gains tax which had in fact only been paid to the state once. Because the payout is automated, the trade can be repeated again and again.Some financial experts have likened the practice to the banking equivalent of parents claiming child benefit for multiple children when they only have one.“This was the environment at that time: a financial industry that – at least as far as I could see – was geared towards maximum profit optimisation,” the 41-year-old told a packed courtroom on Wednesday.“One tool to achieve this goal was tax optimisation: avoiding taxation as far as possible – and taking advantage of any opportunities that could be found or created. This was not the clandestine approach of a few. Rather, I saw it as the clear and openly communicated expectation of most major banks and their customers.”Hailed as a maths prodigy at school, Shields accepted a junior position at Merrill Lynch after studying engineering, economics and management at Oxford University because the trading room floor offered him a thrilling, dynamic environment. He was not alone: of 120 engineers in his year group at university, Shields added, only five went into engineering.Wearing a navy blue suit and the latest Apple Watch 5 with a white strap, Shields on Wednesday used a Powerpoint presentation to talk the court through the “cum-ex ecosystem” of labyrinthine trade chains he helped conceive and control, which prosecutors say cost the German state €450m. A translator tasked with rendering City trader jargon into German legalese was struggling to keep up.The financial rewards were breathtaking: for the five years in which Shields practised cum-ex trades through Gibraltar-based investment vehicle Ballance Capital, his personal income amounted to €12m. In 2010 Shields and his wife managed to purchase a £9.7m mansion on Chelsea’s Egerton Crescent, followed by a €6m Edwardian terrace on Shrewsbury Road, Dublin’s most expensive residential street.While Shields did not respond directly to the charges of serious tax fraud this week, he said in hindsight he had started to feel regret about devising the schemes, which hoovered up money that could have otherwise been spent on building roads, hospitals or nurseries.He told the court: “I often ask myself whether if I had my time again I would do things differently. Knowing what I now know, the answer is obvious. I would not have involved myself in the cum-ex industry.”He had made the “difficult decision” to cooperate with the investigation, which increases his chance of reducing a potential 10-year jail service. Co-accused Nick Diable (39), who worked with Shields for Germany’s fourth largest bank HypoVereinsbank (HVB), will also give a testimony in the trial, which is expected to last until next year.Shields said cum-ex trades were practised on an “industrial scale” in the first decade of the 21st century, and involved a vast network of banks, companies, brokers, lawyers and financial advisers. Even the most basic cum-ex deal involves at least 12 transactions.A spokesman for Deutsche Börse, which was raided in connection with the wider investigation in August, said it was cooperating with the authorities.During Shields’s appearance this week, the back benches of the court were packed with numerous lawyers representing high-profile banks and financial institutions that could be dragged into the scandal if the judge in Bonn rules that cum-ex trades did not merely exploit a legal loophole but violated the law at the time.Three characters mentioned in the testimony were notable by their absence from the court proceedings: Shields’s long-time boss and later business partner Paul Mora, and the renowned German tax lawyer Hanno Berger, who allegedly introduced him to cum-ex methods at HVB. A third man, Dubai-based British citizen Sanjay Shah, is alleged to have copied their methods to defraud the Danish treasury on a vast scale.Until 2015, Mora was a director of the Cinnamon Club, an opulent ​Indian restaurant located in a grade II-listed Victorian building next to the Department for Education and popular with politicians and business people. According to Die Zeit, the restaurant was where cum-ex deals were contrived and later celebrated, and one insider referred to it as the “cum-ex lounge”. Mora has denied wrongdoing, telling New Zealand media that all his trades were “approved by legal experts and undertaken in accordance with advice”.In separate investigations into the same scheme, the justice minister of North-Rhine Westphalia said that Cologne prosecutors are now conducting 56 probes with a total of about 400 suspects related to cum-ex. More than 400 iniduals and companies have been charged in connection with the scheme in Denmark.Estimated losses include an estimated €31.8 bn Germany, at least €17bn for France, €4.5bn in Italy, €1.7bn in Denmark and €201m for Belgium“The Cologne investigations have now reached a point that prosecutors say that cum-ex wasn’t a legal tax-driven trading strategy, but organised white-collar crime of unimaginable magnitude,” the minister said.A prominent German tax official turned tax lawyer whose past clients include the owners of BMW and companies like Adidas, Berger has been described as the mastermind behind the cum-ex scheme and was charged with tax fraud at a court in Wiesbaden last year. Based in Switzerland, he insists all of his dealings were within the law and has not appeared in court so far.A 51-year-old Kiwi with a penchant for rugby and Hawaiian shirts, Mora had a background in tax law before moving into investment banking in the City of London. At HypoVereinsbank and his own investment vehicles Ballance Capital and Arunvill, Mora is alleged to have worked with Berger to construct a vast number of cum-ex trades. Believed to have returned to New Zealand, where he has property investments in Christchurch, Mora has also not appeared in the German courts to far.A British-born son of Indian immigrants from Kenya is the key figure for investigations in Denmark, where prosecutors say he defrauded the treasury to the tune of €1.3bn, mainly through his hedge fund Solo Capital LLP, by copying the system used by Berger. Shah has denied any wrongdoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e264a18547854f49ba3e86fa91b4cc7fe7c691b8/0_13_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdc15cde68253af4002246e4312bbfa4","title":"bankers corbyn tories no deal capitalism radical government","story":"Faced with the Tories’ no-deal extremism and a glaring crisis in capitalism, the financial establishment is losing its fear of a radical Labour governmentBeneath all the noise of Brexit, an unexpected question is being quietly asked in British politics as an election nears. Is a Jeremy Corbyn government actually the safe option? If you’ve been persuaded by the years of warnings from most of the media and countless politicians that such a government would be extreme, chaotic, authoritarian and doomed to failure, you may find this question ridiculous. If you’re still a Corbynista, then the notion of him as a stabilising premier for today’s turbulent Britain may be equally absurd. For many believers, the whole point of Corbynism has been the possibility that it might lead to “the most radical government in British history”, as the leftwing theorist and activist Jeremy Gilbert yearningly put it in 2017.Off the record, other senior people in the City tell me they find the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has been circulating among them busily in recent months, a serious and intriguing figure: a supposed Marxist who looks, and sometimes talks, a bit like a bank manager.A similar thaw is under way in the more thoughtful parts of the business press. With western capitalism having a crisis of confidence, at the very least – this week the Financial Times announced “Capitalism: time for a reset” – Labour’s radical economic alternatives have begun to look more reasonable to some business journalists. The Economist, despite its longstanding support for the Thatcherite free-market reforms that McDonnell would like to reverse, has been covering the development of Labour’s new economic thinking with intense curiosity since 2017. This month, the more cautious, centrist FT has published a succession of long articles about “Labour’s new establishment” and its ambitions for Britain. While the pieces were still spiked with criticisms, the scale of the coverage has suggested a degree of respect – and that corporate Britain needs to understand Corbynism, and be prepared to make some accommodations with it. Why are sections of the establishment being drawn to Corbyn and McDonnell now, having ignored or dismissed them for so long? On the face of it, the shift is all about stopping or moderating Brexit, at any cost. A little less obviously, it’s about the condition of the Conservative government: its snowballing incompetence, its increasingly manic and fantastical policies, its disregard for democracy and the law, its readiness to break up the UK, and its shallow pool of talent after almost a decade in power. (Priti Patel doesn’t seem likely to become one of the great home secretaries.) As Westminster participants and observers used to say, in more consensual times, it’s time for a swing of the pendulum.Since Corbyn became Labour leader, he and McDonnell have worked hard to seem more respectable. During Corbyn’s decades on the backbenches he was a bit of a scruffy ranter but in the Commons these days, with his neat white beard and stern glasses, he often acts more like a veteran school inspector, casting a disapproving eye over the government’s shoddy work. Both he and McDonnell now wear trim suits and ties to most public occasions the contrast with Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings’ careless dishevelment might make a good election poster.This air of solidity is not a complete illusion. Since Corbyn took over Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats have each had three leaders. Meanwhile Labour’s policies – relentlessly dismissed as weird and naive by newspapers that saw no downsides to austerity and Brexit – have in fact often carefully gone with the grain of public opinion: renationalise the railways, raise taxes on the rich, put more police on the streets, avoid fighting foreign wars that lead to terrorism.Potent governments, such as Tony Blair’s or Margaret Thatcher’s, usually have a good understanding of how most voters are thinking and living. Under Corbyn, Labour is at least trying to do the same, by beginning to confront the crises of capitalism and the climate breakdown, and how they affect people’s everyday lives.In less than half a decade, despite never being in power, and only rarely leading in the polls, Corbyn’s Labour has helped crystallise what students of the great Italian leftwing thinker Antonio Gramsci would call a new political common sense: a widespread feeling that free-market capitalism has run its course, public spending needs to rise, and the way we manage society and the economy needs to change. As a keen Gramscian, McDonnell must be delighted.But Labour’s new respectability brings dangers. First, do British voters actually want a sober, reforming government? The polls currently suggest not: since Johnson began his cartoonish premiership, Labour has been consistently behind (though the margins have varied from substantial to tiny, usually according to the pollsters’ different methods).Britain has arguably not had a Labour government with ambitions to profoundly alter the country since Harold Wilson’s first in the 1960s (and his reforming zeal didn’t last long). With Labour so often cautious since, many voters – and political journalists – have become unused to making the effort needed to consider novel and ambitious leftwing policies, such as McDonnell’s plan to change the balance of power in companies permanently by making their workforces into major shareholders. It’s easier just to dismiss such proposals as anti-business, and then get back to gossiping about the latest Tory leadership shambles.Another problem for Labour with trying to play the grownups is that clearing up messes left by Conservative governments can be a thankless task. In 1974, Wilson’s second administration inherited an economic and industrial relations crisis from the disastrous 1970-74 premiership of Edward Heath. Wilson never quite managed to resolve the crisis, and soon his party was blamed for it – so much so that Britain’s struggles during the 1970s have been synonymous with Labour ever since.Corbyn and McDonnell’s smart suits and new ideas will only get them a fair hearing from the establishment for so long. A Corbyn government, if it ever comes, will disrupt the status quo: “Change is coming,” McDonnell warned the FT this month. For the moment, some business figures may prefer a Corbyn government to a Tory one that can’t guarantee the food supply but they may soon decide that an actual reforming Labour government is not such a good idea after all. As Oliver Harvey of Deutsche Bank reassured the , “any market-unfriendly policies instigated during a Labour government” need only be “temporary”. They would apply only “until the government is voted out of office”. And just in case that doesn’t happen quickly enough, the papers read by Britain’s rich are full of articles about how to get your money out of the country. • Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8071e51da61c9a0ac157fcc94126d0cdf2c846a/0_0_2064_1238/master/2064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b4a9e85769a1883ef75171eca13579f","title":"downton abbey film fantasy reality","story":"The American south may seem a long way from the estates of England, but in both places a veil of caprice covers harsh truthsThe son of a Scottish immigrant who worked as a servant, Donald Trump could hardly wait for his banquet at Buckingham Palace. A seat next to Elizabeth II conferred a sense of accomplishment little else could.To many, such behavior from an American president appeared downright unseemly. But how could we scoff? How else have so many of us been eagerly awaiting the return of Downton Abbey?TV and film can be transporting, giving us glimpses of lives we can only imagine imperfectly. Decades before Julian Fellowes’ creation came forth to conquer America, PBS offered a steady diet of British clotted cream. Royals, aristocrats, castles, servants, sex. Such is the stuff of which Downton daydreams are made.We make our own fantasies too. As a boy, watching Gone With the Wind, I saw plantation houses for which I thought I could sell my soul. It seemed such an alluring way of life.No wonder people complain of being lectured about slavery when they visit Savannah or Charleston. They, like me, have imagined themselves in the master’s place. No work to be done, fanned on white-pillared porches, sipping cooling drinks, pondering pleasures to come. Is it surprising so many, confronted by the nightmare behind the reverie, recoil in unacknowledged shame?I came to this crossroads early, no longer able to overlook the anguish of my ancestors. I saw exquisite architecture and ideas of gracious hospitality but knew both to be built on the worst criminality.Fortunately, thanks to green England, I was able to transfer my affections. The Forsyte Saga, Upstairs Downstairs, Brideshead Revisited, The Admirable Crichton. The Shooting Party, The Remains of the Day, Gosford Park. They became my refuge and taught me much. Entranced by an elegant aesthetic, reading countless books, even attending the Attingham Summer School to study famous country houses, I sought an elusive loveliness, untroubled by oppression.I know I never escaped. I had only embraced a new quagmire of contradictory caprice.At the very lightest level, all this means I know that Downton – the whole phenomenon, the TV series, the film, the traveling exhibition, the merchandising – is a ludicrous and ahistorical fancy.I know, for example, that contrary to what we see on Fellowes’ screen, non-royal butlers did not wear white waistcoats and that waiters did not wear dinner jackets at all. I know ladies were never gloved while drinking or eating, candles were never used on a luncheon table and candle shades, now found only in royal residences, were in fact universal. For enthusiasts like me, it’s such esoterica which makes Downton so enjoyable.But as in my love affair with the plantations of the American south, there was a wriggling worm in the bud.How alike our ruling classes are. How nefarious the sources of their vast wealth, on which such beautiful homes were built.In the UK, to take just one example, a house as sublime as Harewood, near Leeds, altered by Robert Adam, was funded by the infamous triangular trade. Even English currency came to be defined by slavery. With abolition by Britain in 1833 came compensation to 46,000 slave owners for 800,000 liberated Africans, until the banks were rescued in 2009 the largest government bailout in history.There were other sources of income. Indian opium, imposed on China. Farms in Ireland. The wealth behind many of the estates of England was no less tainted than that which built plantations in Virginia, Alabama and Georgia.Fellowes was careful to give his great house a more benign foundation. The Earl of Grantham, we are told, derives his affluence straight from his Yorkshire estates.Hit hard by agricultural depressions, he takes an option not available to his tenants: he marries the daughter of an American millionaire. That said millionaire is an untitled Jew, a dry goods merchant from Cincinnati, is among storylines meant to show us what a good egg the earl really is, an unlikely egalitarian in tweeds. But he’s an imprudent one too: by investing his wife’s millions in a Canadian railway that goes bankrupt, Grantham places all his loved ones in peril.Worse occurred in real life, of course. Much worse. Take the brutal, polluting mills and mines, like so many plantation fields, that often lay just outside the gates.Of course, Downton isn’t real. So, to stay in the realm of art, consider Shipley, the neo-Palladian masterpiece DH Lawrence invented for Lady Chatterley’s Lover. There, Squire Leslie Winter talks of the miners who work his pits with all the condescension a planter might have for his slaves.Chatting with the Prince of Wales, Winter quips: “The miners are perhaps not so ornamental as deer, but they are far more profitable.”HRH replies: “If there were coal under Sandringham, I would open a mine on the lawns and think it first-rate landscape gardening. Oh, I am quite willing to exchange roe-deer for colliers, at the price.”In the real world, many fine homes have been lost. Their deaths, like their lives, are all about the money.In Lawrence’s book, the squire dies and his heirs tear down his hall to build semi-detached “villas” for workers. Lady Chatterley is shocked to learn such people are as capable of love as she is. One suspects Fellowes, the author of a novel called Snobs, no less, might feel a similar shock if told us ordinary people who love Downton, his facile but beautiful and seductive creation, are capable of sincere feeling too.We are. And while we are equipped to daydream of such luxury for ourselves, or to pick nits with Fellowes’ staging while we swoon at his stars in their gorgeous firmament, we are also the heirs to those who did all the work, those who built the Downtons and the plantations.We know a profound truth behind all their costly beauty and misery. Every stately home, in every land, belongs to us too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a566e13a0e577da0431900841ebdb135bb2c17a2/0_134_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d63c1b6a63e69b08c00b134f6b30cc5","title":"nature conservancys global photo contest winners 2019","story":"The global conservation body Nature Conservancy, working in 72 countries to tackle climate change and to conserve lands, waters and oceans, has announced its latest photo winners, selected from more than 100,000 entries"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16d2ff9795eb8944bb45dc36b63bc862b9da2a7f/0_0_5246_3491/master/5246.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fe5151fa528cb113d5778e0b503115bd 1320w","title":"high octane glitz for versace as j lo brings the house down","story":"The actor’s appearance in ‘That’ dress from 2000 had the crowd in Milan whoopingOne of the lesser-known aspects of Versace’s brand mythology is its role in the inception of Google Images.The story goes like this. In the year 2000 – as fashion scholars will recall – Jennifer Lopez wore a sheer, low-cut green Versace dress to the Grammys. “The whole world wanted to see that dress,” said Donatella Versace at a press conference in Milan on Friday. And so the world surfed the net – as we used to say – but couldn’t find the picture within the mainly text-based system. And lo, Google Images was born.The gown – inevitably known as ‘That’ Dress – melted the internet again when it appeared on the catwalk at Versace’s springsummer show on Friday. Donatella teased the audience at first, using its print on tote bags, hooded jackets and denim skirt suits, its palm fronds interpreted as crystallised details on pool sliders and appliquéd on shirts.At the end of the show, Jennifer Lopez herself appeared in the dress, in a move that had US Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour beaming and the upstanding, whooping, Instagram-posting fashion crowd proclaiming it even more spectacular than the moment, in 2017, when the designer reunited five supermodels.Even before J-Lo turned up, the show felt cranked up to 11, quite a feat for a brand so seeped in glitz and hedonism. All the biggest Insta supermodels – Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kendal Jenner and Vogue cover star Kaia Gerber – were there. The music pumped while palm tree fronds were projected on to floor-to-ceiling digital screens on the walls.The clothes were larger-than-life, literally, being a millennial take on 80s power dressing. Exaggerated proportions – T-shirts and cardigans with rolled shoulders built in and leg o’mutton sleeves on trench coats and leather dresses – ensured even the most waif-like models took up space as they strode down the catwalk. The Versace-logoed T-shirts and marble dyed tights were social media catnip.It was all strategically choreographed, of course. In September 2018, Versace – until then famously one of the last family businesses standing in fashion – was acquired for $2.1bn by Michael Kors Holdings, which then rebranded to Capri Holdings. With Versace, Michael Kors and luxury shoe label Jimmy Choo under its umbrella, Capri Holdings aims to become the first American luxury conglomerate to rival French behemoths LVMH and Kering. Versace is key to that growth, with the company seeking to double revenues and open 112 more stores by 2022.Versace was one of the brands that signed up to the Fashion Pact, launched at the G7 summit in August, and as such has pledged to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and protect and restore natural ecosystems and oceans.The environmental impact of this particular show and collection was, at time of press, unconfirmed by the brand. There had been a lot of talk of tree-planting and carbon offsetting at some of the other shows this fashion month. At this show a tree was actually erected but it was part of the set – a 9-metre-tall gilded statue of a palm, which felt very Versace.You wondered whether some attendants might object to such high-octane glitz on global climate strike day. But with the ultimate feel-good moment of Jennifer Lopez strutting down the catwalk and Donatella Versace beaming beside her such concerns were too easy to forget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92896ef1e529e133eee6eb2d6fc2c631aa084880/906_501_4690_2814/master/4690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbb587c04f1e62e2e48578cb31d47c64","title":"mum wanted me to have clothes shopping grief","story":"We had always shared the fun of fashion. Now she was dying, I found comfort in silk blouses and glitter platformsAs my mother lay dying on a hospital bed, I went shopping. After long days at her bedside, doing my best to buoy her spirits, helping her sip water from a cup because she was too weak to hold it, after almost daily round-trips from home by rail to that hospital in my old stomping grounds, my shopping urges became fairly frequent. As the toll of her illness and slow painful death overwhelmed me, I shopped, then some more, and then some.Neither of us knew she was dying at first. My mother was tired and ready, she often told me, to shuffle off at 84. Her body was a bit of a wreck but her brain still worked she still cared about the cryptic crossword and the state of the Labour party. It encouraged me to hear of her antics during the morning medical catch-ups, and so her death just didn’t fit into my picture, even when a bumbling junior doctor took me aside to tell me she was very ill indeed.Having recently left a big career and sold a big house to make a transatlantic move to be nearby, as she grew old in her housing association flat in Bromley (the same flat I grew up in), facing her death was something I could not contemplate. I listened to the doctor but did not hear. Instead, I thought about shoes.Freestyle spending became my opiate, a life-affirming pastime and a happy place, away from the despair of critical patients and weeping families. Silk blouses, boots, eyeshadow palettes and undies are pretty, after all, and taking them home made my world a bit beautiful. I don’t remember showing her anything, but she did notice and admire a rather fabulous 60s cut vinyl coat. The term retail therapy, coined in 1986 by the Chicago Tribune and defined as shopping to improve the mood of the buyer during periods of stress or depression, is often casually or comically applied to periods of intense spending, especially by women. For me, there was nothing funny about it. As I stared from train windows, stumbled through hospital corridors, met social workers, safe-guarders, test-givers and an occasional doctor, contemplating a trip to the shops subdued my escalating emotional pain.I’m not the only one. So common is it, that researchers at Melbourne University have advocated spending as therapy as a psychological disorder called oniomania, existing on a spectrum with shopping addiction or compulsive buying disorder. Like any addiction, it comes with a withdrawal and comedown period unless you keep shopping, of course. The good news is that an oniomania tendency is often short-lived.My mum and I had always connected over clothes common ground in a relationship that was at times isive, although no more so than most we were simply different women separated by generations and expectations. As a kid in Canada, she would take me off to get the latest haircut, dress me in nice frocks and was always at the top of her fashion game. Over the years I had become used to sharing the fun of fashion with her. She was always eager to discuss her own life in clothes, and kept the standout pieces long after she was able to wear them. She was my first style icon I remember her sitting at a Singer sewing machine, or with knitting needles working wool into a bouclé poncho – maybe in a pantsuit, always wearing a nude Revlon lipstick.After my mother died, I had to clear her flat, which no one tells you can be one of the most painful parts of the process, sifting through all those memories, all those feelings, all those things. In her bedroom I found an unused Oscar de la Renta for Vogue kaftan pattern from 1973 I know this because she dated the envelope. It felt like a direct message from her, a special gift.In the months immediately after my mother died I continued to shop, filling the hole that grief ripped through me with yet more stuff and a new mantra: “Mum would have wanted me to have this.” Beautiful things made me feel better. Putting on something a bit fabulous made it easier to leave the house on my darkest days, and it wasn’t just about clothes. I had to hear live music, stand in front of great art, live large for my mum because she no longer could. A lot of my purchases were frivolous, but I think she would have heartily approved of the green glitter platform shoes I bought for a landmark birthday party.Before that birthday, when friends rallied round my daughter and me, proving there can be love in grief, there was another, much more significant outfit to choose. As her youngest child and the only one able to attend her funeral, I had to choose what my mother would wear in her coffin. I picked a dress she had made herself – a long navy number with a delicate gold pattern and cuffed sleeves, as much a tribute to her lifelong creativity as it was a glamorous goodbye: she had been born into a family of war women who sewed and knitted and put themselves together beautifully, but had little money. A scarf to hide her neck malformed by cervical dystonia, the onset of which led my proud mother to become ashamed of her appearance, to stay indoors much more than she should, pinned with a maple leaf brooch to honour the country that was her home for over 20 years and where three of her children were born.I chose not to see her in that last ensemble but, as the coffin was carried in, I imagined her as she had been, and the only way I choose to remember her now: stylish and beautiful. I wore an old black and white dress, a new coat and a large Air Force Blue hat, to honour her days in the post-war Women’s Royal Air Force.As the months passed my grief lifted, and my shopping compulsion has been put to rest. I now think more than twice about buying things. I envisage my daughter having to get rid of all the stuff when I’ve gone. I hope that’s a long way off, but I will still pencil in a Swedish Death Cleaning in about 20 years. My talented girl is doing brilliantly well in sewing classes, carrying on a family tradition, and doing her part for the slow fashion revolution.I like to think some of my shopkeeper friends miss me. I met some wonderful women on those excursions, women with their own grief stories, who were kind enough to share them. I still pop in for chats now and again, but the debit card stays in the wallet.I have many regrets about my mother’s death – what I did or didn’t do – but not about the shopping. I acknowledge the comfort it gave me, and cannot say it will never happen again. The second anniversary of her birthday since she died is fast approaching, and I plan to make that kaftan at last. I’m going to wear it somewhere she loved and that holds special memories. If you see me swanning about in it, please don’t ask me where I bought it. I made it myself, and won’t be buying anything to cheer myself up.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e8e4d9efa3f23e1b57875cd6171ea3c783c1e5b/0_0_1597_1598/master/1597.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cf4299f2d4486d8a41e82ad85ea8b334 960w","title":"international incident work mistake official secrets film","story":"It was the Observer’s big scoop of 2003, and as a young journalist, I was asked to type up a top-secret memo. Now my mess-up has made it to the big screenHave you ever wondered who’d play you in a film? I had, occasionally, until the day I got the answer. In spring 2018, a message pinged on to my phone via Facebook from a journalist friend. “So this is a bit weird,” it read. “A sister of a friend is playing you in a movie, apparently. You aware of this?” I wasn’t.“Hanako Footman is playing you in the film Official Secrets. She wants to meet you, like actors do. She saw we were pals and asked if I’d ask you. What did you do in that story?”“That story” concerns British whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley in a film that premiered at Sundance festival in January. Fluent in Mandarin, the 28-year-old Gun was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. In 2003, she leaked a top-secret memo to the Observer about an illegal spying operation ordered by the US National Security Agency. It intended to bug the phones and emails of six United Nations delegates, from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan – nations that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq.The memo, which outraged Gun, ordered staff to increase surveillance operations “particularly directed at… UN Security Council members (minus US and GBR, of course)” to provide real-time intelligence for Bush officials on voting intentions. I was working at the Observer at the time. And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf – the biggest mistake of my career.It’s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing – low-slung jeans nicknamed “bumsters”, for obvious reasons thongs crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, “shrugs”, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent.The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 911, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain’s “special relationship” with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women’s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell – himself a former Observer journalist – Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: “You’ve got the job… if you want it?” Of course I did.Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry – the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach \u0026amp Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book – a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, “replacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver”.It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team – but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn’t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer’s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor – played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn’t given any other information. Their only instruction: “Don’t make any mistakes.” And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.Importance HIGHTop SecretAllAs you’ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge…… We’d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper’s front-page splash: “Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war”. Underneath was the memo I’d typed up.Of course, the story – broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) – was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn’t expect it to be the office. It was – I think – Stephen Pritchard, the paper’s readers’ editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused “something of an international incident”.Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I’d changed all the American spelling “mistakes” to British English. “Recognize” became recognise, and “emphasize” emphasise. “Favorable” was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer’s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo’s authenticity. It was decided the readers’ editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us “lying limey bastards”, claiming that the story’s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.Of course, it was not. Despite my “administrative error”, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I’d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back it had, of course, been filled.By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I’d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name – one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt – they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I’d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn’t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn’t ulge any specifics about the movie. “But is it made clear I wasn’t fired over what happened?” I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? “Most of my outfits were probably too casual,” I said. “I was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.” And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as “Nicole” got bawled out by the Observer’s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team – thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me – albeit a more groomed version.I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn’t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one’s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 OctoberIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9fa167d0b9c895b93629d06623dfedd911dc134/0_252_6628_3976/master/6628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd9c052d87f4a28ae171c2ae91111a55","title":"dairy farmers turn back clock customers take fresh look at milk","story":"“When the milk price crashed five years ago, we were in a bad way,” says Bryce Cunningham, a third-generation farmer running Mossgiel farm in Ayrshire. “Fifty, sixty years ago, you could make a living on a dairy farm now you’re expected to just survive. So I thought, ‘If we did it the way they did it before, could we survive?’”The farm sits on the land that Robert Burns farmed in the 1700s. “Farming the land that he worked, could we recreate the milk that he drank?”It’s a romantic concept, but Mossgiel farm is part of a wave of dairy farms witnessing a resurgence in demand for the unadulterated, glass-bottled milk of yesteryear, before standardised, plastic-bottled became the norm, and long before plant-based milks hit Instagram.Commercial homogenisation (emulsifying the cream into the milk rather than letting it float naturally on top) began less than a century ago, but it didn’t dominate the market until relatively recently. Today, most milk consumed in the UK is pasteurised, homogenised as well as standardised – which is to say, processed to assure a consistent percentage of fat.There are countless hotly contested theories professing the merits of raw, unpasteurised, unhomegenised milk. Pasteurisation heats milk to destroy potential pathogens but, say raw milk advocates, kills many vitamins and mineral which could be beneficial to health. The homogenisation process – emulsifying the milk to distribute fat molecules evenly so the cream does not rise to the top – also destroys beneficial nutrients.Now, farms such as Mossgiel are opting to raise their cows organically, and not to homogenise their milk. For Cunningham, it’s this approach that brought his family farm out of crippling debt.Geoff Bowles, who runs Ivy House farm in Somerset, which provides Harrods, Fortnum \u0026amp Mason and Selfridges with their unhomogenised, organic milk, cites the high price of the equipment needed as one of the reasons he has never homogenised his milk but, aside from the purported health benefits, he also highlights its practical value.“It will mask the early stages of souring,” he says. “Whereas with non-homogenised milk, the fat coagulates and floats to the top – that’s how you know it’s on its way out.”Mossgiel moved all its packaging over to glass and reusable plastic in January. Last November it produced 8,000 to 9,000 litres a week for 251 customers today that has risen to more than 15,000 litres for 379 customers. Cunningham thinks the packaging is responsible for this increase.The environmental impact of plastic is likely impacting these figures, particular since awareness was raised by David Attenborough in his much-publicised criticism of its catastrophic effect on the world’s oceans in Blue Planet II last year. Vending machines have emerged where customers can fill up their own containers with non-homogenised, organic milk – Mossgiel supplies four in Scotland. Ivy House delivers its milk to coffee shops in churns.Roger Kerr, chief executive of Organic Farmers and Growers and former managing director of the Calon Wen cooperative in Wales, thinks people are becoming more aware of their impact on the environment. “I think some of these changes are happening because of the plastic thing. People are wanting to do something: ‘What can I do, given I’m not going to stop flying to Ibiza, or driving my car?’The move to glass is part of that, as is the rise in doorstep delivery.”In the age of Brexit and cultural uncertainty – like the nursery food that gained popularity during the 2008 recession – old-fashioned milk seems to have become part of Britain’s nostalgia safety-net. Except this time, there’s a positive result for the producers’ efforts: financial, not to mention environmental, gain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22cb175555bf2c3124716a37bf7a6cf39565795b/0_176_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d8943c4839727286566416e6263619","title":"leicester v tottenham premier league live","story":"James Maddison’s delightful late goal settled a brilliant game that included an extraordinary finish from Harry KaneThat’s it for today’s blog. I’ll leave you with Paul Doyle’s match report from the King Power Stadium, and John Brewin’s bumper clockwatch. Bye!“We are a top side now – I think we have to be seen as one of those top sides. Nobody will want to come to this place when it’s rocking like this. If you look at our performances at Chelsea and United, we came away shaking our heads in disappointment because we didn’t get what we deserved. We’re showing we’re a big threat now.That was great fun. Harry Kane scored an extraordinary goal to give Spurs the lead. Ricardo Pereira equalised from close range and then James Maddison scored a delightful late winner. He is going places so are Leicester. Peep peep! Leicester move up to second in the table, at least for a couple of hours, after a stirring comeback victory. It was a fine game between two excellent sides, but Leicester just about deserved to win after an excellent second-half performance.90+4 min Leicester look reasonably comfortable, despite the inevitable late pressure from Spurs. 90+3 min Maddison is still out there but he can’t run. That’s a worry, especially if it’s an ankle ligament injury.90+1 min There will be six minutes of added time.90 min The impressive Soyuncu makes a couple of important interceptions, one with his head and one with his left foot. Brendan Rodgers is developing a really fine young side.89 min Maddison is limping heavily. He’s going to continue, though, as Leicester have used all their substitutes.88 min Maddison has a problem with his left ankle. He landed awkwardly while trying to play a through pass, and is receiving treatment.87 min Lucas Moura replaces Ndombele for Spurs. The most exciting young player in England gives Leicester the lead with a superb goal. Choudhury played a short pass to Maddison 25 yards from goal he took two quick touches to set humself up and then belted a low, curling shot that snaked past the ing Gazzaniga and into the corner. That’s a lovely goal.A brilliant goal from James Maddison!84 min Leicester make their last substitution: Youri Tielemans off, Hamza Choudhury on.84 min “Hi Rob,” says Andrew Buddery. “I thought VAR was supposed to eliminate clear and obvious errors, not make them.”83 min Gray is booked straight away for a studs-up lunge on Rose. That could have been a red card. Just before that, Kane shot too close to Schmeichel after a nice Spurs move.82 min Rose’s cross clears everyone in the middle and comes to Aurier beyond the far post. He takes a touch and lashes a low shot that goes well wide of the far post. That was a good chance.80 min “Of all the valid complaints against VAR, offsides isn’t one of them,” says Mary Waltz. “He. Was. Offside. Yes, by less than an inch.”But how does VAR judge when the ball is played? The split-second between the ball touching the foot and then leaving it makes all the difference. I’d like to see how that works before I trust it on such tight decisions.79 min Erik Lamela is replaced by Christian Eriksen.79 min Son quickens the pace, skinning Tielemans and hitting a dangerous cross that is palmed away by Schmeichel. Evans completes the clearance. Moments later, Kane misses with an attempted overhead kick.77 min The Leicester fans are making a fair old noise. It does feel like the kind of game that will have a late winner, although I’m not sure who will get it.74 min “The Son offside call on VAR,” says Sandile Xaso. “This cannot be our sport, this cannot be right.”You’re right: it’s not right, and it’s not our sport any more.73 min Leicester are pushing for a winner. Maddison threads a nice pass down the inside-right channel to Vardy, who bullets a rising drive just past the angle of post and bar. I think Gazzaniga had it covered.Yep, this one counts. The move was started by Barnes, who found Vardy on the left side of the penalty area. His cross deflected off Alderweireld and fell perfectly for Ricardo, whose close-range shot hit the sliding Rose and beat Gazzaniga.67 min A substitution apiece: Praet for Perez, Wanyama for Sissoko.VAR has decided that Son was 0.0000001 centimetres offside in the build-up.Leicester will feel they’ve been mugged. Soyuncu made a fine tackle on Son in the box, but Kane picked up the loose ball and found Aurier in space on the edge of the area. He controlled the ball and lashed a shot that took a slight deflection before spinning past Schmeichel.A goal was coming - but it’s Spurs who have scored it!63 min It feels like a Leicester goal is coming, and Chilwell wins another corner on the left.62 min Barnes shifts the ball to the side of Aurier and hammers a low cross that flashes right across the face of goal.60 min Barnes heads wide from eight yards. It was a difficult chance, because Ricardo’s lofted cross had no pace on it at all. But the build-up play was lovely, particularly Maddison’s control in a phonebox as he pulled down Perez’s pass from the right.58 min: Son misses an excellent chance! Spurs broke from the Leicester corner and should probably have gone 2-0 ahead. Winks, on the left, played an angled through pass to find Son in the area, but he dragged a left-footed shot wide of the far post.57 min: Good save from Gazzaniga! Tielemans slipped a through pass to Vardy, who surged into the area and hit a left-footed shot across goal. The sliding Vertonghen took some of the heat out of the shot, having done brilliantly to stay with Vardy, and Gazzaniga ed to his left to push it away. Rose completed the job by putting the loose ball behind for a corner.56 min Here’s Ian Copestake. “As a chant in response to Leicester fans’ implying ref bias, I am not sure if ‘Paul Tierney’s done really well, in very difficult circumstances’ will scan.”I can add a few effs and cees if you think it will help.55 min Son finds Lamela in a bit of space on the edge of the D. He takes a touch and then, as defenders converge, whips a shot over the bar.53 min Maddison’s corner is headed away by Lamela.52 min Tielemans wins a corner after a nice run down the inside-left channel. Leicester look much sharper than they did towards the end of the first half.50 min Leicester have started the second half really well. After a nice move down the left, Chilwell’s early cross is just too far in front of Vardy.46 min Barnes beats Aurier on the left of the area and hits a shot that is headed away by Alderweireld. Ndidi’s follow-up dribbles wide.46 min Peep peep! Leicester begin the second half.“Was the VAR decision correct?” says Liam. “They looked at the moment when the shot was struck but if you watch it again none of the Leicester strikers followed the shot they ran back to get onside and then ran in. If this is correct will a goal scored by a keeper be disallowed because a striker near the halfway line was offside?”Yeah, it was the correct decision. Perez had an advantage by being in an offside position, because he was able to get to the loose ball before the Leicester defenders. Thus it counts as the same phase of play. At least I think that’s the logic. To be honest, I’ve given up trying to understand how football works in a post-VAR world.“Some half-time thoughts on Spurs: while the pundits want to declare the Pochettino project in decline, as a fan I see them as trying to maintain a high level whilst navigating a transition,” says Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo. “The thinness of the squad showed cracks as they made their turn at the end of last season. Now, almost the entire defence and some of the midfield (SissokoEriksen) needs to be replaced in the short and mid-term. Despite all this, when they’re trailing in a game you can never count them out of the game. That resilience is probably Poch’s biggest achievement and hopefully will transcend even his time with the club.”Is the squad that thin? I think the problem – in terms of catching City and Liverpool – is the first XI rather than the back-up. They’re still the third best team in England, though, which is only a slight decline from 2015-17.Peep peep! Spurs lead through a unique goal from Harry Kane. See you in 10 minutes for the second half!43 min “Lamela’s got that no-look look on,” says Jeremy Dresner. “A very fun player to watch when he is passing like this.”That he is. I love the way he hugs the ball on his left foot.41 min Lamela, who has had so much space between the centre-backs and Ndidi, surges forward and finds Kane on the right of the box. His left-footed shot is surprisingly tame and Schmeichel makes an easy save.39 min Perez, found by Tielemans, thrashes a shot towards the near post that is beaten around the post by Gazzaniga.37 min “Lightning quick beautiful goal,” says Mary Waltz. “How did Kane do that?!!”Instinct, the footballer’s best friend.33 min Ricardo Pereira shoots a few yards wide from distance. Gazzaniga had it covered.31 min Lamela finds Kane, who drags a low shot well wide from the edge of the area. That goal, though. It reminded me a little bit of Gianluca Vialli’s incredible sliding header against Bari in 1991-92.What a stunning piece of improvisation. Son, found by Lamela, moved to the edge of the area and backheeled the ball into the path of the onrushing Kane. He was bumped by Soyuncu, which meant he was off balance as he dragged the ball past the last man Evans. By the time Kane was in a position to shoot he was in the process of falling flat on his face. Yet he still had the awareness and ability to chop down on the ball, stunning it into the ground so that it bounced over Schmeichel’s shoulder and into the net. That’s an astonishing goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822f0104a75e384e3b2b61a7d5c4e11f6ac567f8/0_54_5358_3215/master/5358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a46fff371045c1f3b0f1883d89fe53c3","title":"manchester city v watford premier league and more clockwatch live","story":"Here’s Paul Doyle’s match report from the King Power Stadium.Barry Glendenning on the unlikelihood of Watford beating City is worth a read.

Marco Silva’s sheen is being tarnished by Everton being, well, Everton again. They were hopeless last week at Bournemouth, frankly. Sheffield United, after their bright start, know they are in the Premier League now, and were on the end of VAR last week against Southampton. No Billy Sharp for them, either, after his red card in that game. The Championship, after Leeds take on strugglers Derby in that early game, will see Swansea, who began the day level on points, taking on Bristol City.

This is the true story of having – and losing – a superpowerby  Caroline Rothstein with illustrations by Hokyoung Kim for NarrativelyOn 10 March 2009, a case was filed in the US circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, where I grew up. Rothstein v American Airlines, Inc starred my father, Plaintiff Steven Rothstein, and the defendant, then the world’s third-largest airline. With $23bn in annual revenue, American Airlines had nothing to lose. For my father, it was a last-ditch effort to save his life.Here’s how it all took off. In the early 1980s, American rolled out AAirpass, a prepaid membership program that let very frequent flyers purchase discounted tickets by locking in a certain number of annual miles they presumed they might fly in advance. My 30-something-year-old father, having been a frequent flyer for his entire life, purchased one. Then, a few years later, American introduced something straight out of an avid traveler’s fantasy: an unlimited ticket.In 1987, amid a lucrative year as a Bear Stearns stockbroker, my father became one of only a few dozen people on earth to purchase an unlimited, lifetime AAirpass. A quarter of a million dollars gave him access to fly first class anywhere in the world on American for the rest of his life. He flew so much it paid for itself. Often he’d leave in the morning for a business trip, fly back, and I hadn’t even known he’d left. Other times, I remember calling his office to find out what country he was in. He (and our whole family) was featured on NBC’s Today Show in 2003, and then on MSNBC in 2006. For 20 years, he was one of American’s top fliers, accumulating more than 30 million miles, which he acquired every time he flew, even with the AAirpass.Then, on 13 December 2008, American took the AAirpass away.For several years, the revenues department at American had been monitoring my father and other AAirpass holders to see how much their golden tickets were costing the airline in lost revenue. After 20 years, it seems, they’d decided the pass wasn’t such a good idea. My father was one of several lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders American claimed had breached their contracts.A few months later, my father sued American for breaking their deal, and more importantly, taking away something integral to who he was. The legal fight went on for years without going to trial. The story became front-page news. The Los Angeles Times. The New York Post. Fox News. A slew of online outlets. It’s even a perennially popular conversation topic on Reddit.The obvious story is that my father was a decadent jet-setter who either screwed or got screwed by American depends on your take. The coverage is always sensational. And I think – as does my whole family, including my dad – that at the very least, it doesn’t quite land.Legend goes, upon bringing me to O’Hare airport as a baby, my father said, “This is daddy’s playground.”Dad has loved to travel for his entire life. His father, Josh, was a navigator in the army air corps during the second world war and ran a company that manufactured paper and artificial flowers, traveling worldwide and telling stories about the places he went.“When I was nine,” Dad tells me, “we went to Denver. When he left in the morning to go on his business appointments, he said to me: stay at the pool, charge your lunch to the room, and I’ll see you at dinnertime. Make sure you have your tie on.”When he was 16, Dad’s parents took him on a three-and-a-half-week trip: New York–San Francisco–Honolulu–Kamuela–Tokyo–Nagoya–Osaka–Okinawa–Taipei–Hong Kong–Calcutta–Karachi–Tehran–Rome–Florence–Nice–London–New York.“I began to taste, directly, the fervor of foreign travel,” he tells me. “I felt as at home in Copenhagen or Paris as I did in New York … I was a child of the world.”He wrote his college application on a typewriter at a hotel beach in Hawaii and mailed it from a post office in Osaka. In college he worked for a travel agency helping students book standby flights at low fares, which he utilized himself. “I was on my own and could go anywhere at a moment’s notice,” he reminisces. He flew to Europe several times a year and went to live there after graduating in 1972.That December, he joined the wallet business – a company my grandfather had purchased – doing sales. He had an apartment in Manhattan on East 89th Street, but mostly, he was at the wallet factory in Oklahoma, or traveling, both for work and play. On the weekends, he’d rush to Houston, Dallas, Wichita Falls, Mexico City or Acapulco, then back to work on Monday.“Steven got on a plane like most people get on a bus,” says my mom, Nancy Rothstein, who was married to my father for 36 years.Transitioning to finance, Dad moved to Chicago in 1976 for a stint at Smith Barney and, according to him, became the second-highest-grossing stockbroker at Bear Stearns in 1979, where he worked for a decade. Later, he focused on investment banking, and also became the largest shareholder of the financial corporation Olympic Cascade, the holding company of a brokerage firm, National Securities. Through it all, he continued flying. Everywhere. Airports and airplanes – they were who Dad was.When American started the AAdvantage program, Dad and Uncle Shelly (Mom’s uncle and one of Dad’s best friends and business associates) began flying even more than they already did. Then, after a good year at Bear, the investment in an unlimited pass made sense.In September 1987, five months after my brother, Josh, was born, and three months after we moved from downtown Chicago into the north suburbs, Dad bought his unlimited lifetime AAirpass. The cost was $250,000, which the agreement stated was based on his age. My father was 37 years and four days old when he dated the check.Two years later, which was one year before my younger sister, Natalie, was born, he added a companion feature to his AAirpass, allowing him to bring another person along on any flight. The cost was $150,000, based on his being 39 years old. This changed the game, not only for him, but our entire family.Ernie Thurmond, a former American employee who handled Dad’s AAirpass contracts, helped with adding some special stipulations. My parents decided early on to take separate planes so that in the unlikely event of a crash, at least one of them would be alive for their three children. So the agreement amendment stated: “If spouse is the companion, the spouse will be allowed to travel separately from Holder, provided that the spouse travels on the flight immediately prior to or just after the flight taken by Holder.” My parents wouldn’t fly on the same plane for at least a decade after that.Major US and global hubs became Dad’s office American became his home. He knew every employee on his journey – from the curb, through security, to the gate, and on to the plane.In the early 1990s, Dad found his go-to agent at the American Airlines Platinum desk: Lorraine Cross from Raleigh, North Carolina. None of us has ever met her in person. But Lorraine was family, her southern lilt a speakerphone staple at the dinner table. While my father befriended dozens and dozens of American employees throughout his tenure as one of their top fliers, no one played a role quite like Lorraine.Lorraine and Dad became fast pals. Over the next decade-plus, he’d send Lorraine – and others at Platinum – postcards from Maine when he took us to sleepaway camp, menus from restaurants around the world, and magazines from foreign airport lounges. Lorraine loved receiving these she’s even kept the postcards after all these years.She says they shared inside jokes – a lot. “Every time I talked to your father, as we would close the conversation – I’m southern – I would always say, ‘Bye now.’ … That was my closing. He would say, ‘Pay later.’ Caroline, we used to laugh all the time.”Lorraine and the other Platinum desk employees weren’t his only pals. Recently, Dad described himself as being “like an adopted child”. American – and its employees – were his parents. He knew the skycaps at O’Hare, LaGuardia, JFK, Heathrow, LAX the people at the front desk at the Admirals Club pre-departure lounges flight attendants on hauls he frequently flew the gate attendants and the folks who drove the carts from security to the gate, like Aamil.Aamil – whose name I’ve changed to respect his privacy – was a refugee who fled the Bosnian genocide with his family. Dad met Aamil when he was in high school, driving a cart at O’Hare, and took him under his wing – errands and various paid-for-hire tasks. Ultimately, Aamil started coming over for dinner picked us up at school became Josh’s “big brother” ears for his dating rendezvous as he entered high school and was both an employee and a dear, dear friend.Dad “was gracious and kind in a way you don’t see in a lot of people”, Lorraine says, recollecting the time he helped fly some priests to Italy to see the Vatican, or when Mom called her from the local Gap to use miles to help a sales clerk visit her mother.Dad gifted the miles and upgrades he accumulated throughout his life – both before and during his AAirpass tenure – to dozens and dozens of people. Once he upgraded my cantor and his wife to first class from Amsterdam. He regularly let relatives and people in crisis come along in his extra seat. There was the time he took my brother’s best friend on his first airplane ever to see a football game the American Airlines employee he saw in India, crying because she might lose her job if she didn’t make it to Toronto his brother and sister-in-law for their honeymoon a guy from college and his wife who really wanted to go to Australia a man in the back office at National Securities, who wanted to visit his dying father (he got there just in time). “Your family’s heart is as big as the state of Texas,” Lorraine says. “It’s incredible how many lives they touched and how many lives touched them because they’re very sensitive and attuned to what goes on in the world.”I’m not saying Dad was a saint. Just that his AAirpass was about more than solipsistic travel. It allowed him to build relationships. And it allowed other people to access the world like he did. That’s what Dad’s AAirpass and ultra-elite flying status yielded for him: lifelong bonds.On 13 January 1998, the American Airlines CEO, Robert Crandall, wrote my father a letter after they’d seen each other on the Concorde (a transatlantic supersonic aircraft).At the end, Crandall wrote: I am delighted that you’ve enjoyed your AAirpass investment – you can count on us to keep the Company solid, and to honor the deal, far into the future.My friend Phil likes to say my father ran his life like a corporation and raised me in it. His underwear was pressed. UPS and FedEx came nightly to our driveway to drop things off, pick things up. He had packing down to a science – sets of clothes folded and fitted into plastic cases, cosmetics ready to go. We had a whole suitcase closet in the basement, and at some point, he turned the downstairs guest room into a staging area for packing.“They sort of broke the mold when they made him,” says Mom, who is a sleep consultant.He stored everything he collected while traveling in the basement – hotel soaps, shampoos, conditioners his thickened old passports towels shirts hairdryers and combs from around the world – in what we called his “Secret Room”, the key hidden in his office desk. A fun party trick was bringing people inside – his business associates, my siblings and my friends. Sometimes we used the items ourselves. Often, we gave things away. After Hurricane Katrina, Dad and I flew down to New Orleans with boxes of clothes and toiletries. When he went to India, he brought things along. Like travel, for Dad, the Secret Room was an extension of souvenir collecting as a kid.As a kid myself, I often complained about Dad’s excessive traveling. I used words like “abandonment” and “neglect”. In retrospect, that was wildly dramatic. But it’s how I felt.“No matter where Steven went, there wasn’t a day we didn’t talk,” Mom says. “Some men are home every night at 5.30 from the office, but they’re not really there. Steven Rothstein was there.” She emphasizes there with a deep, grinding grunt. “Whether he was in the house or out of the house, he was very involved. He was very much there. And always in touch. I mean, he used a phone … he was one of the first people with a cellphone.”She’s right. Most of my life, I focused on how Dad was always on a plane. When I think about it now, when he was home, he was there: sitting with me on my bedroom floor, or at the dinner table, or coming in to kiss me goodnight. He has a presence. Not only a loud voice, but also a boom of self. He arrives. He is both taking off and landing at once.“He never missed an opportunity to come home to the family,” Lorraine says. “I don’t care where he was going. I don’t care what he was doing. If there was a chance he could come home and stay with his family overnight, he preferred that to any hotel in the world.“I really valued and appreciated that from him,” she says. “His family meant the most. I would say, ‘That’s a long way to go, are you gonna overnight and come back the next day?’ He’d go, ‘No, I wanna sleep in my own bed. I wanna go home. I wanna be with my family.’”I laugh, tears in my eyes. I didn’t know this.“That was crucial to him, to be with his family,” Lorraine says. “He did some crazy stuff to make that happen over the years.”Dad was an airport celebrity, and when we traveled together, it embarrassed the shit out of me. Like riding a cart from security to the gate (because as a family, we ran late – Dad has a knack for rushed arrivals). I would bow my head so I couldn’t make eye contact with anyone we passed. Or walking into the Admirals Club locations and having the folks at the front desk know us by name.Or when, in second grade, he took me to Japan for the weekend because he wanted me to experience an inaugural flight (San Jose to Tokyo). We were in the bulkhead, the first row of any flight cabin. As we landed, there were reporters flooding the jet bridge to photograph the first person off the flight. Technically, based on his seat, that was Dad. But as he figured out what was happening, he insisted I go first so I could be the star. I stood there with my seven-year-old smile, bright-colored headband, and long V-neck Limited Too sweater hanging down to my thighs.I was mortified. But Dad wanted us to experience absolutely everything there was in life.He wanted to take me to all 50 states by the time I was 11. We put a big US map on the wall behind his home office desk. After each trip, I’d add a pin to the visited state another for the places I wanted to go. When we’d gone to 30-something states, I asked to stop I wanted to be able to have new adventures as an adult.“You grew up with a different lens than most people you knew,” Mom says. “I’m not saying … that other people didn’t travel all over the world. But I sort of doubt, for the most part, they had the kind of wanderlust and open-mindedness and fascination that your father had with the world, and still does, for that matter.“Yes,” I answer.“Not only framed you,” she adds, “but it helped with your, your tapestry. It was woven into your tapestry. Into the fabric of who you are, and how you look at other people and the world.”I understood the weight and privilege as a kid. I understood – we all did – that the AAirpass meant my father could travel and do business in unprecedented ways, and it allowed our entire family to travel in ways few people on earth could. We got the privileges, all of them, all of us.I ask my sister, Natalie, a psychotherapist living in Chicago, her earliest memories of traveling on an airplane: landing in Australia at age three, walking down the aisle as the plane was still moving, and someone grabbing her to keep her safe. “I think I remember that because it was really dramatic,” she says. “I have a lot of vivid memories from that trip, actually.”“Were you aware that we were in first class?” I ask.“I didn’t sit out of first class until I was 12 years old,” she says. “I don’t know if I was aware when I was three years old. But I was aware very early.”Wont to interrogate privilege – race, class and otherwise – I pry. Did she really get that first class was different than the rest of the plane?“For a long time, I really wanted to sit in coach,” she says, “because I felt uncomfortable being a kid in first class when it was clearly where all fancy adults were sitting. It was clear I was surrounded by mostly people who had a lot of money, and I was always one of the only kids in first class, and that felt weird and I always wanted to be with other kids in coach.”That trip to Australia (I was in fifth grade) was our first big international family vacation. The following year, Dad, on a whim, said to Mom: let’s go to Tokyo.“Japan!” she said. “Over Christmas? Are you kidding?”But we went.Mom can still perfectly picture us all at dusk in Tokyo: “Dad has on his camel coat. You and Josh are in all the black-and-white-check stuff. We’re walking through an aisle of stalls … going to yet another monastery or shrine and the flavors that we felt and saw and tasted … it was probably one of the best Christmas vacations we’d ever had because we were the only people in the hotel.” She starts chuckling. “And it was so much fun. It was so unusual to be Americans at Christmas in Tokyo.“It was about seeing the world … We wanted to connect to the people,” she says. As she recounts these stories, her tone is somewhere between euphoric and frenzied. She punctuates each story with an “oh my God” and transitions immediately into the next.“When we were in India … we got so friendly with our cab driver that we brought him for dinner to the hotel … For a while we were in touch … We would send him pictures and things. That was the kind of richness that this AAirpass, this sense of a family traveling anywhere we wanted to go in the world that American could take us – that’s what we did. People enriched us. Hopefully we enriched others.”She starts laughing as she recalls a time we visited the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Dad got in trouble for lying down with his yoga strap, trying to stretch his back in front of the church. “I mean, there was so much color in what we did and where we went and how we did it. The travel was first class, the hotels were first class, but the experiences were very real and authentic.” And then without skipping a beat, she goes up an octave with: “Oh my God … so Josh was dead when we first went to India, right?”“Josh was dead both times we went to India,” I say.“Yeah,” she says. “But he was very much with us, I’m sure.”On 6 October 2002, Josh – 15 and a half – was hit by a car while walking down the sidewalk. The car had pulled an illegal U-turn. To avoid a collision, another driver accidentally accelerated, swerved up on to the sidewalk and flung Josh into the side of a building. His head hit the building. He was knocked unconscious. My uncle Jeffrey called me from Scarsdale and told me to get on a plane. It was my first month of college I rushed to the Philadelphia airport and bought a ticket home. I landed at O’Hare, descended to baggage claim, into more uncle’s arms. Their faces distraught: It doesn’t look good. It would be at least another 15 years before I could descend the American Airlines baggage claim escalator without going into a trauma shock.Josh died the next morning – our rabbi and the hospital chaplain reciting the end of life Hebrew blessings and prayers Dad, Natalie, our maternal grandmother, and me standing around the bed Mom’s own body draped alongside her dying son Natalie’s hand on his heart for his last beat.Over a thousand people attended his funeral. Lorraine helped get people on flights. I remember a family friend walking through the front door of our home after a flight from Australia, as if she’d taken a bus.To say Josh’s death broke Dad would be an understatement. Ernie from American says it was sad to watch Dad when they occasionally saw each other over the years. “He’s not the same person any more,” Ernie says.Josh was Dad’s little buddy. His only son. He’d already lost his father in 1989, and he would soon lose the companionship of Uncle Shelly, when Shelly had a stroke.“People react to tragedy in different ways,” Lorraine says. “He let Josh’s death take the best of him away … Outwardly, his strength was renowned. But I knew how much it impacted him … I know his children meant more to him than any business deal, than any situation in life that could come up.”Right after Josh died, Dad leaned on people like Lorraine, and other agents and employees, which I hadn’t known until writing this piece. I had asked Dad what the media tends to overlook when they cover this story.“When everyone was asleep in the house,” he tells me, “and I had nobody to talk to, and I was lonely about Josh’s death, I would telephone American Airlines reservations and speak to the agents about who knows what for an hour and then at the end, they’d ask me, oh, what reservation was I calling about to make, and I would say, ‘Oh yeah, I need to go to San Francisco next week.’ I really didn’t need to go to San Francisco. I was just very confused and very lonely and I was calling American Airlines because they were logical people for me to speak to. They knew me. I knew them. I knew their names. I knew their lives.”I tell Dad this makes sense, to lean on the community you know in a time of need.“I traveled all over the world,” he says. “Going from the front of American Airlines to the gate, I might see a dozen people, each of whom would say hello to me, and I would say hello to all of them.” Dad says that about 10 American Airlines employees came to Josh’s funeral. “That’s an extremely unusual relationship for a passenger to have with the airlines.”I talk to Natalie, who was still at home with a front row seat to his grief while I was away at college. She tells me about the shame Dad felt when people in our community often pitied him after Josh died – and still do – as if he were a broken man. But the airport and American were where he was still treated like a full, whole man.“His community at American treated him like a normal human, and walking through the airport, they didn’t treat him like he was broken, the way a lot of his other worlds did,” she says. “It was the only sense of normalcy that he still had.”Six years and two months later, Dad arrived at O’Hare with Aamil, who needed to go to Sarajevo but didn’t have the cash, so Dad offered to fly him to London on his AAirpass and then pay for his London hotel and airfare from there to Sarajevo.“ I went into the ticket counter. I checked in my luggage for London. I walked to the gate … and just as I was walking on the plane, they handed me a letter terminating the AAirpass,” Dad recounts. “Why did they let me go to the gate? Why didn’t they tell me up front, which would have been the nice thing to do?”Turns out a letter had been drafted to notify Dad that they were concerned with his behavior and use of the pass. But they decided not to send it. They didn’t want the bad press – what it might mean to terminate a lifetime AAirpass from a frequent flyer. So they terminated it without warning, at the airport – a punch right into Dad’s proverbial heart.Even Lorraine hadn’t been notified. “I walked in one day from work,” she said in a deposition, “and received notification that the AAirpass had been terminated. I was probably more shocked than anyone else.” No warning. No input sought, even though she had been regularly managing his and other top fliers’ bookings.Dad’s luggage went to London. They wouldn’t help him get it back. Aamil never made it to Sarajevo. In fact, that was one of the last times they ever spoke. Ultimately, Aamil disappeared from our lives.Dad doesn’t think Aamil understood the “shock and horror” of what had happened. Dad went home. Told Mom. Got in bed. And slept for the rest of the weekend, and arguably – at least figuratively – for a really long time after that. “I was in disbelief,” he recalls. “I was in shock. And I had no idea how I was going to live my life the way I lived it.”The AAirpass was Dad’s lifeline. His blood. Mom described his relationship with it as “sacrosanct”. There was a contract. Rules. It was his superpower. He didn’t ever want to do anything wrong.But American claimed he did.Dad was one of a few lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders that American had been monitoring and claimed had breached their contracts. They claimed Dad made “speculative bookings” and a host of other things that they interpreted as objectionable based on a clause in the contract about “fraudulent usage”.“When I bought the AAirpass, in no uncertain terms, they told me that there was only one rule: I couldn’t give anybody the AAirpass,” Dad says. “And those were the days before they took identification from passengers.” A former colleague had once offered him five grand a week to use the AAirpass. Dad told the guy he was “crazy”.But now, after years of secret investigation, apparently Dad and others were costing American too much money. Though Dad had dealt with the reservations agents on an almost daily basis, it was the revenues department that got involved, interjected, and launched an investigation that brought the whole house down.On 10 March 2009, Dad sued American for breaking their deal, claiming $7m in damages. The dollar amount was based on the value of the lifetime unlimited AAirpass the last time it was sold for public consumption – though American had stopped selling them in 1994, a 2004 Neiman Marcus catalogue offered them for 3 million bucks. So it was the Neiman’s figure plus estimated costs for first-class travel for the rest of his life.A primary issue in the case was whether American properly terminated his AAirpass Agreement based on Section 12, which read:12. FRAUDULENT USAGE. If American determines that an AAirpass has been fraudulently used, American reserves the right to revoke the AAirpass and all privileges associated with it. Holder will thereupon forfeit all rights to the AAirpass, without refund, and will return the AAirpass card and this Agreement shall terminate.They claimed that his “fraudulent usage” included booking empty seats for his companion feature under “Bag Rothstein” or “Steven Rothstein Jr” (which they had for years condoned, and Mom says was not Dad’s idea), as well as “booking speculative reservations” – ie, flight reservations he was allegedly never planning to actually take.Dad believes there was someone at American who decided, “Oh, if these guys didn’t have these goddamn AAirpasses, it would be great.”According to Lorraine and the legal documents, a longtime American employee launched the investigation, looking into several other AAirpass holders, including Dad and Jacques Vroom, another lifetime unlimited customer, whose AAirpass termination also resulted in a lawsuit.(I reached out to American Airlines for comment on this article. Their media relations representative said: “We are pleased to continue to provide AirPass benefits to eligible cardholders when enjoyed in conjunction with the appropriate program conditions.” They said they did not have anything to add beyond what’s already in the court documents.)Truth is, AAirpass was – even in its earliest, earliest days – a failed program. It didn’t yield the revenue they’d hoped. In 2017, one writer listed the lifetime unlimited AAirpass as number one on the “7 Worst Marketing Disasters in human history”. In fact, when AAirpass started, according to Ernie, American thought they’d make “hundreds of millions of dollars” selling them, but they did not. “It became painful,” Ernie says. He says he tried several times to get them to shut it down they didn’t want to admit defeat.As for the case, American anticipated a resolution without a trial Dad anticipated a trial by jury. Instead, everything happened in legal offices, calls, motions and documents, judges’ chambers and depositions. They spent the summer of 2009 debating – back and forth – over the fraud clause, and whether it was ambiguous or clear.Then, American counterclaimed, saying Dad broke the contract by improperly using the companion feature. In early 2010, they claimed, “Rothstein had a history of making speculative, fictitious, impossible andor illogical reservations on behalf of companions.” They claimed these “companions” were people with whom he “had no intention of traveling”.The senior analyst who launched the investigation reviewed and analyzed Dad’s flight records, and claimed “that between December 2003 and April 2004, Steven Rothstein made companion reservations using ‘Steven Rothstein, Jr.’ using for his AAirpass companion feature for at least 41 flight segments”. But again, they had condoned his booking companion seats under fictitious names for years. In April 2004, an American employee had approached Dad and asked him to stop, as security measures around flying had clearly started to shift after September 11. So he stopped.But they continued investigating him, looking for a way to push him out.Another document shows that American contends that 14 incidents from August 2006 to November 2008 were considered “fraudulent” under their alleged terms – but Dad was never notified that they were considered fraudulent at the time they were made.In her deposition, Lorraine said she hadn’t received any written directions from American Airlines regarding what was and was not “acceptable practice for making reservations for the Executive Platinum customers”.Lorraine said, both in her deposition and our interview, that she didn’t suspect misuse of his AAirpass they were the ones handling all of his bookings. Yet, they – Lorraine, and anyone else in reservations – weren’t contacted at all once revenues began the investigations.Mom chuckles when she recalls sitting in the federal judge’s chambers with the attorneys in 2010 as American noted his making “fraudulent reservations”.“Steven never made a single reservation on his own on a computer,” she says. “Every single reservation he ever made was made with an American Airlines paid employee.” Dad didn’t use a computer. He was the first person I knew to have a cellphone, and then the first person I knew to get a BlackBerry (and remains one of the last to have one). To write letters, he’d use an electric typewriter or audio-record memos on his Dictaphone and mail mini cassette tapes to his secretary to type and then fax or mail accordingly. But a computer – never. Still doesn’t.Ernie says Dad found creative ways to use his AAirpass, even though Ernie knows of other cardholders who absolutely violated the terms of use – letting others use it, getting paid. “He would be at the airport waiting to board an airplane by himself,” Ernie says, “and he would meet somebody at, like, the Admirals Club and get into a conversation with them and they’re on the same flight he is and he said, ‘Well, why don’t we continue this conversation on the airplane? Let me go check and see if they’ve got any open seats in first class,’ and he would invite that person to join him.“It was not prohibited by the language of the contract,” Ernie says. “But it was not intended to be used like that … I don’t think Steve did anything that was directly or intentionally trying to do something that was … against the rules. Certainly it took some interpretation on American’s part to go after him.”Seven third-party witnesses connected to Dad – family members, friends and business associates – were interviewed during discovery. They were questioned by American around the “speculative bookings” that were deemed retroactively fraudulent.Sometimes Dad would spontaneously book a flight for him and a companion – say, taking my aunt to visit my cousin in Denver – planning to twist his loved one’s arm to travel at the drop of a hat. But that’s the challenge. Rarely could anyone else do that, even if they gave their word. Only Dad knew how to drop everything and fly. That was his superpower. He had wings. The family member, or colleague, or friend he hoped to take along couldn’t always go.Dad’s lawyer asked one of my uncles: “Do you have any reason to believe that Steven Rothstein made reservations in your name without actually intending to bring you along as his companion?”“Never,” he said.Maybe it seems normal to me because that’s how I was socialized, in the vortex realm of a father who treated an airplane like a bus. As a journalist, now, I can read the court documents and understand where – from American’s standpoint – this behavior was kind of absurd. Yet American Airlines agents condoned it for decades. And understanding that the legal terms of the contract and agreement stipulated that fraud meant giving someone else your pass to use, Dad’s quirky and hectic and allegedly “speculative” behavior seems reasonable within how he worked.There was discovery and depositions throughout 2010 there were seemingly endless motions and American kept extending discovery then a summary judgment in American’s favor on 30 June 2011. They had won.American dismissed “with prejudice” their remaining counterclaims then the case went into a holding pattern after American’s parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy that fall a joint stipulation of dismissal was filed on 21 September 2012, the day before Dad turned 62.But that wasn’t the end end. As mentioned, the judge issued a summary judgment. Then, the court of appeals affirmed. Dad had lost. The appeal stayed until American exited bankruptcy in December 2013. And the final chunks of paperwork were filed in 2014. But it never really quieted.I didn’t know the full details of the trial until I wrote this piece. That my mother, two uncles and an aunt all went in for depositions, or that hundreds of legal hours and thousands of dollars and documents unfolded. I didn’t quite get the magnitude until taking off my daughter hat and trading it in for my journalistic reporter lens.This spring, after gaining access to the court documents, and reading over 80 documents in full, I call Dad as I leave my writing space at 11.30pm and walk to the subway station at Union Square in Manhattan. I say this is clear: what American did to interpret fraud was out of line. But I say: “Dad, some of the bookings they cited for what they called speculative as evidence in the case were … well … shady.”I tell him I need to maintain my journalistic balance and integrity. I ask him point blank: “What’s the deal?”He goes on: “After they told me not to buy an empty seat they knew that I was in a huge depression in the actual MEDICAL SENSE. IT WAS A SERIOUS DEPRESSION. I was incoherent, crying several times daily, drinking liquor which I never did before and if I got in a seat I didn’t want to explain why I was crying to anyone.” So he wanted it empty. He wanted to be alone, just as had always been his booking practice on many airlines, even well before the AAirpass days. He liked his space. He liked access to bringing extra carry-on bags. He liked some privacy. The airplane was his home. It’s where he lived. It’s where he got to do work, or catch up on sleep, or regenerate. Then, once Josh died, it’s where he grieved. He was at home.People buy extra and empty seats all the time. Technically, that’s what he’d done with the companion feature. A permanent extra seat for life – whether another human was in it or not.In one sense, I understand how these could be interpreted as “speculative bookings”. Dad does admit he booked seats he wasn’t sure that he, or his companions, would ultimately use. But that’s not an uncommon practice, and he never understood it to be against the rules. His understanding was that fraudulent behavior was limited to giving the AAirpass to someone else – which he never did.“I never booked my own reservation on a computer,” he reminds me. “I never knew how to do this. So every single one of the reservations they didn’t like was booked andor changed by an American employee. Again. I didn’t know how to use a computer. I still have never ever ever booked any reservation online. I always use the phone. So their own agents never stopped me from anything. And I didn’t understand what American was asking me to do or not to do because my mind was torn apart from depression. Real depression.”The 7 April 2018, article in the Hustle by Zachary Crockett quoted my father saying: “I wish I’d never bought the thing.”Earlier this year, I speak to Dad, in India, where he’s traveling for work. He FaceTimes me from his hotel room (from an iPad, still no computer). He sits on a couch, a desk and bright lights trailing in the background.I ask if he’s accepted the loss – the AAirpass.“Probably, yeah,” he says. “Enough’s enough. I can’t worry about it all day long.”Twenty-six minutes and thirty seconds later, after he’s relived 13 December 2008, so I could recount it above, something shifts.“Why did they have to be mean?” he says. And later, he interrupts himself mid-story: “What American did was nasty.”It’s like there isn’t space for anything else in his mouth or head.“It took away my mobility. It took away my hobby. I thought that I could go to Sweden for the weekend in July and pick up flowers when I was 70.”“And now?” I ask.“I can’t do that, can I?”“But how do you feel about it all now?”“I’m angry,” he says. “Still. I’m less angry. But I’m still angry.“They stole my personality,” he continues. “They stole my love. They stole the very thing that caused me to give them a half a million dollars in the first place. And a half a million dollars is probably like 5 million dollars today. And they did it maliciously. If there had been a problem, the proper thing to do would have been to telephone me and tell me they’d like me to change the way I used the AAirpass.”I remind him that when we started talking, now 59 minutes ago, he said he had accepted it all.“I guess as I think about,” he says, “I’m angry. So maybe someplace in between. Or maybe my mind goes back and forth.”Grief and death don’t discriminate. Loss – human life, financial wealth, material goods – doesn’t discriminate either. It’s gut-wrenching no matter what. Of course, racial and class privilege, body ability, access to healthcare and support, and other privileges obviously play a massive role. But the inside spectacle of pain is traumatic across the board.“Your dad was so depressed as it was,” Mom says. “He was totally unglued after Josh died, and then he loses the one thing that gives him some freedom to run away from his grief.”The AAirpass “also wasn’t just a loss for him”, I say to Mom. “It was a loss for our family because it gave us access to experiences that were part of who we had become as a unit, and we’d already lost Josh, and so to have lost the AAirpass meant we could no longer travel.”“… Like we did,” she adds. “Because economically after Josh died, it was also a problem. Dad wasn’t able to work at the same pace, speed and everything else that he had. So it was a huge loss, and it was shitty timing because it gave our family an opportunity to still travel, to find the joy in travel … It took away a big part of our lives, and we already had a big part of our lives taken away … So, it was a family trauma.”We’ve done a remarkable job – at least in my opinion – of finding some way back to being a family unit after Josh died and my parents got orced (which, having separated in the years after Josh died, was formalized in 2014), and Natalie and I have built an unbreakable bond to manage the vacancy lingering between our age gap.I ask Natalie if she has any resentment or anger about the AAirpass.Dad still hasn’t gotten used to it. The AAirpass was “his pass to freedom”, Mom says. “The trauma of taking that away, it grounded him, literally.”“He seems to be, I don’t know, is he running from things?” Ernie adds. “I didn’t think of him as a settled person.” Ernie notes the places my dad has lived – or tried to live – since my parents sold the house and got orced. Berlin. Hong Kong. India. New York. Chicago. Australia. France.“It’s like if he stops moving,” Ernie says, “then he’s not him any more.”We inherit things from our kin. As much as I salivate over locking myself in a silent cave to write, I feel a wildly profound sense of purpose when I’m traveling. As an internationally touring poet, performer and educator, when I am on tour, I am alive. I know how to operate an airport or bus terminal or Amtrak station or rental car. Natalie does too. People have come to me about their hatred or fear of flying. It’s like a spa, I tell them. A certain amount of time in the sky that belongs only to you. Regardless of your seat.Of course, I recognize that because I was socialized to fly in first class, my feelings about travel are biased. Even though I fly economy now, even though my eyes can tell the difference, somehow my body does not. I am in the air. I am free above the world. I don’t need fancy seats or legroom. I’m just grateful to get a break from Earth.My best friend, Chloe, recently asked me what my favorite airline is, given all the travel I do. I said, even though they so deeply impacted my family’s life: American. I feel nostalgia. Loyalty. It’s like having a crush on that kid who chases you around the playground, or never letting go of your first true love.Mom still has skycaps’ numbers in her phone. She, Natalie and I all still fly American, even though it hurts (and I have exactly 384,475 American miles at the time of publishing this piece, so if that dwindles unexpectedly, we’ll all know why).When I talked to Lorraine, she told me she wanted to go to Fargo, North Dakota.I scream: “Lorraine! I’ve never been to North Dakota! Fargo is on my bucket list!” I’ve made it to 47 states by now Oregon and Alaska are still on the list, as well.“Oh my God, Caroline, I’ve got a feeling we may end up going to Fargo, North Dakota,” she says, “laughing our butts off and having a ball.”I am yelping at this point. Literally hitting my leg and chair audibly. Suddenly, I feel like Dad must have felt talking to her – laughing, joking, dreaming up trips. Some people inherit money. Or trauma. A host of other things. I’ve inherited plenty, but perhaps – more than anything – it’s the wanderlust and desire to meet people and go places around the world.After we scheme about Fargo, she sends her love to my mother and sister, and says she’d love Dad’s number she’d love to catch up. I thank her and wish her a beautiful day.“You as well, Caroline,” she says. “I still love ya, so you take care, sweetheart.”“Love you as well,” I say. “And what was it that you would say to my dad?”“And then ‘pay back’?”“He would say, ‘Pay later.’”I ask if we can try again.This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

His daughter Nancy is on the line. She wants to know if he will be free to come and see her awarded a school prize. “I’ll be there, darling,” he assures her. “I’ve almost finished all these hideous interviews.”For the past week, and for the first time in more than three years, Cameron has barely been off the airwaves or out of the media. The hideous interviews have come thick and fast. Some of the headlines they have made have been calculated, like the settling of scores with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over Brexit. Others have been inadvertent, like the revelation that Cameron lobbied for the Queen to “raise an eyebrow” about the Scottish independence campaign during the referendum in 2014.At his launch party on Tuesday, the former prime minister joked that there were two hardback bestsellers being published this month. “One’s a book about a riven society and a dangerous dictatorship,” he told guests. “And the other’s by Margaret Atwood.” His own book, it is clear from our interview, has a wider purpose. Three years after his premiership collapsed in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, Cameron is trying to regain the right to be heard, above all on Brexit and on the referendum that swept him from office.“I totally understand that there will be some people I will never convince, who will say you should never have had it,” Cameron says of the 2016 vote. He knows that millions of remain voters blame him viscerally for everything that has happened since then and probably always will. “But I think there are a lot of people who can also see that there was a growing inevitability about having a referendum and, yes, there was a problem in the Tory party, but the relationship with the EU was a far bigger one. Britain’s position was becoming more tenuous, and we had to fix it. I hope that I can convince people that it was an honest and thought through attempt to deal with the issue.”This is the nub of the case that weaves its way right through the 700 pages of Cameron’s memoir and through much of what he has said in interviews this week. The UK’s relationship with the EU was always both necessary and contingent, he argues. Until now, every prime minister for the last 40 years has simultaneously wanted a seat at the top table and a special deal for Britain. Every one of them, even Tony Blair, felt they had to fight off moves to political union. “These weren’t pretend ghouls and ghosts,” Cameron says. “They were real.” It’s a useful reminder that Cameron, so often dismissed as an insouciant optimist, is at heart a very practical politician.He is insistent that British ambivalence has origins that long predate the migration crisis or the rise of Nigel Farage. Cameron traces the roots back to Margaret Thatcher’s support for the EU single market in the 1980s. “The single market was both the best thing and the worst thing for Conservatives. We created it. But then we didn’t like the legislation that was needed to make it work.”“The EU is a law-based organisation that doesn’t like exceptions,” he continues. “The differing speeds issue had to be addressed, especially with the eurozone.” Cameron thinks the balancing act would have had to continue even if remain had won in 2016. He quotes the downbeat assessment of an anonymous official (surely the Bank of England deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe) telling him “it would have kept us in the EU for another 10 years”.“My biggest regret”, he says, is that he let expectations about his 2015-16 renegotiation get too high. “I should have made it clear that some of the things my colleagues were arguing for were not available – picking and choosing which laws to obey, radical cuts in the budget, some sort of country club membership. These things are not possible.” He thinks there was more substance to the renegotiation deal he brought back from Brussels in February 2016 than is now acknowledged. The concessions he achieved were “a big deal for the EU. They hated it.”Some of that defiant confidence drains away when Cameron talks about the referendum process itself. He thought “a lot” about writing a enhanced majority threshold into the referendum legislation, but it never happened. “I agonise about that one.” He thought the Electoral Commission “got it wrong” by insisting the choice on the ballot was between remain and leave, not yes (Cameron wanted a yes-to-Europe campaign) and no. He had always thought June 2016 would be the optimum date. Now he is not so sure. “We lost the vote so it’s worth asking the question.” He is scathing about Labour’s role in the campaign under Jeremy Corbyn. “They were awol.”Cameron’s own stance on Europe has not changed three years on. “I’m a remainer,” he says, without equivocation. And it is as a remainer, albeit a pragmatic one, that he has watched events unfold – and now unravel – since he walked away in July 2016.He says supportive things about Theresa May. “She was definitely a moderniser.” But his disagreement with her Brexit strategy is barely concealed. He approves of the fact that “she got a deal”. He “shares her frustration” that it was then voted down by “the people who most wanted Brexit”. But, crucially, he says that “picking one of the existing models, a Norway-style model, would have been a safer and more secure way to deliver Brexit while safeguarding the economy.”And he is critical of her failure to adapt her strategy after the 2017 election. “If you think about it like that, then the red lines, the election result and not reaching out more until too late to other support have had an impact. You need Labour support for a partnership Brexit. If you go back to the beginning, to 2016 and particularly after 2017, you might have been able to get more buy-in. The government went in a different direction, with the red lines and all the rest of it.”And, now, today, under the very different leadership of Boris Johnson? Cameron’s answer may surprise many, since he admits he is open to a second referendum if Johnson fails to make a deal. “I think it is more difficult now. Logically, where we are is either Boris gets his deal and brings it back and passes it, or there are three options: you can find another deal, you can have a general election, or you can have a second referendum.

He remakes the case for his Tory party modernisation project during the opposition years from 2005 and for the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition’s austerity programme after 2010. Though he admits that “some of the early speeches were a bit ‘Hello birds. Hello trees.’” he is convinced that his 11-year leadership has been hardwired into “a modern compassionate Conservative party”. The book also contains some very good anecdotes about everything from Brussels summits to visiting Balmoral. Many who read the pages on the death of his son Ivan in 2009 will be moved to tears.In the end, though, everything in Cameron’s story always comes back to Brexit. “It is very difficult to try to put Brexit to one side because it’s so massive,” he admits. But he sticks to his fundamental argument about his defining legacy. “It wasn’t some cranky view that there would have to be a referendum. The idea that this was just a Tory party drama, a Tory obsession, is not correct. Yes, it was a particularly big problem for the Conservative party and the pressure was growing and growing. But I was wrestling with a genuine problem.

Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud. Anthony KiousopoulosI fear an elimination at the pool stage, especially taking into account recent results. Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approaching the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

With the clock running down, the Argentina full-back had a chance to reclaim the lead after what had been a one-sided contest turned into what should be one of the closest encounters this tournament.To France’s enormous relief the kick faded left and after squandering a 17-point half-time lead they had snuck home 23-21 thanks to a drop goal.France have struggled to deal with the rigours of professionalism more than any other leading country. They have had to become more disciplined since in the amateur days, as in having a greater resistance to foul play, and temper their indulgence. It has made them volcanic rather than mercurial with the eruptions occurring all too frequently this decade, certainly in the Six Nations. They give themselves more licence in the World Cup and here they were at their most swashbuckling, for the opening half at least, working space through off-loads and stepping that thwarted Argentina’s narrow defence.France scored two tries and should have had to more as they assembled a 20-3 lead at the interval. The first, scored by Gaël Fickou, was prompted by Maxime Médard’s short, subtle pass, the flair of Daniel Penaud and the footwork of Virimi Vakatawa. Argentina had barely recovered when the quartet were at it again for Antoine Dupont to score in the corner and Penaud should have made it three but took his eyes off Vakatawa’s pass.Argentina took an early lead with a Nicolás Sánchez penalty but other than the scrum, where they harvested penalties throughout, they were clearly inferior. As France showed at the start of this year’s Six Nations, though, when they blew a 16-0 interval lead against Wales on the opening night, hot can very quickly turn cold.Argentina were in the lead with 13 minutes left after going back to basics. They were winning the penalty count and one minute after the restart they kicked to touch, drove a maul and the second-row Guido Petti Pagadizábal, who had sparked his side’s most menacing break in the opening period, was driven over.The mood changed inside the stadium. France became introverted, Argentina galvanised. The ball took to the air and after another penalty and driving maul, Julián Montoya brought the Pumas to within five points of their opponents. On came French replacements, but Les Bleus kept conceding penalties and the replacement Benjamín Urdapilleta kicked two to give his side the lead.When France announced their team on Thursday, the general reaction of their media was that the selection showed the focus was on the 2023 World Cup, for which they are hosts, given the experience that had been confined to the bench. The reaction after going behind suggested otherwise and having just come on for Penaud, who needed a head injury assessment after Boffelli fell on his head, Camille Lopez dropped into the pocket after a series of drives dropped a goal from 40 metres to put his side back in front.There was ample time for France to blow it. After Romain Ntamack had missed a penalty from wide on the left, France were trying to run down the clock when Fickou took out Boffelli in the air, a needless challenge given that he was never in a position to contest for the ball and play was just inside his half.Boffelli took the kick himself. He had the distance but not the direction and, although Argentina had one more play, France forced a turnover without for once conceding a penalty. The prize is probably finishing second behind England, but with France you still never quite know. The volcano is far from extinct."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b39310d3e812bea611c1b4501363f4c99d4591/146_100_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8424475da9e4537f03bc08bda2f850ae","title":"new zealand south africa rugby world cup match report","story":"New Zealand’s proud record of never having lost a Rugby World Cup pool game is still intact after a thrilling victory over South Africa. In one of the great World Cup pool matches, the All Blacks’s counterattacking brilliance narrowly cancelled out the Boks’ more direct and physical tactics to secure a 23-13 win their opening fixture in Japan.From 17-3 up at half-time Steve Hansen’s team had to weather a determined South African fightback but held their nerve in a breathless final quarter. The result increases the chances of England facing the All Blacks in the semi-finals should Eddie Jones’s squad finish top of Pool C and win their subsequent quarter-final.In a fluctuating contest, the defending champions, chasing a third world crown title in succession, were initially hustled and hassled by South Africa’s rush defence whenever they had the ball, with their half-backs Aaron Smith and Richie Mo’unga the subject of particularly close attention. South Africa also did their best to slow down their opponents’ rhythm and enjoyed almost all the early territorial advantage.The All Blacks had difficulty in eluding the Boks’ giant green tentacles and could easily have been further behind had Handré Pollard not crashed a straightforward penalty against a post after 19 minutes. From that moment South Africa’s early grip on the game faltered, as New Zealand’s threat off turnover ball became thrillingly apparent.Mo’unga helped to spark the comeback with a deft cross-kick in his own 22, freeing Seru Reece to make good ground and launch a flowing upfield move which ended with Beauden Barrett offloading out of a tackle by Eben Etzebeth to the supporting George Bridge. Inside four minutes New Zealand had a second long-range try on the board, Dane Coles putting Anton Lienert-Brown through a hole before an untouched Scott Barrett strode 25 metres to the line.Kicking poorly to the All Blacks back three will be to invite trouble at this World Cup given space and time there is no one to match them. The debate over Beauden Barrett’s best position is a red herring on nights like this, given his angles of running and sense of timing regardless of the number on his back. Ardie Savea was also a serious ball of energy whenever South Africa’s big forwards were not keeping him busy defensively.The last time New Zealand lost a game when leading by seven points or more at half-time, remarkably, was against France in the quarter-final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. They have never been reeled in when presented with a lead of more than 12 points, leaving South Africa with a Mount Fuji-sized challenge to overcome.They gave it more than a crack. South Africa’s outstanding quicksilver winger Cheslin Kolbe almost scored one of the tries of the century after an inspired dash down the right touchline before Pieter-Steph du Toit spotted a gap at the side of a ruck and ed over for a converted score to reduce the margin to 17-10.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterDuane Vermeulen, playing his 50th Test, and Faf De Klerk then combined to create a thrilling charge straight through the heart of the All Black defence, with South Africa only denied another score by a crucial turnover close to the line. A coolly taken Pollard drop goal narrowed the gap just before the hour, setting up the tautest of final quarters. On this evidence the chances of these two sides meeting again in the final at this same stadium on 2 November are already high."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69da2634924130b1ee0a26bd9a02e67dc3fd4555/0_174_2502_1501/master/2502.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=382ff074e1e51a52d38c57ba46e628c6","title":"reece hodge high tackle peceli yato australia fiji rugby world cup","story":"For 15 minutes the Sapporo Dome sounded as loud as any other ground in the game. And then the rugby started. The volume was ear-splitting in the minutes before kick-off, while the stadium PA was pumping out music, but it fell almost entirely silent in the very second the New Zealander Ben O’Keeffe blew his whistle.It was so quiet in the first half that you could clearly hear the players shouting to each other over the murmurs of the 40,000-odd people in the ground. It made it all feel fairly surreal, as if all these happy new fans were still trying to figure out exactly what they were watching. Well if they were, forgive them their confusion, because, judging by the refereeing, a lot the experts out there are pretty baffled, too.The match turned in the 25th minute. Till then, Fiji had been so much better, stronger, faster, sharper than Australia that it was not at all clear which of the two teams were supposed to be favourites. It was not just the Japanese who were quiet. The thousands of Australian fans there were dumbstruck, too, you guess, at the way the Wallabies were being shredded in front of them.A group of supporters behind the Australian posts eventually struck up a chorus of Waltzing Matilda. Who’ll come a waltzing Matilda with me? The Fijians didn’t need to be invited, they were already dancing dizzy rings down on the field.It began when their brick-wall winger Semi Radradra bounced Reece Hodge on to his backside. Hodge, a glutton for punishment, ended up on the other side of the field, where Radradra’s teammate Josua Tuisova hit him harder still.Hodge was having a hell of a day of it. When Yato came at him again, barnstorming down the wing after a nifty short lineout, Hodge decided to throw himself into the road like a despairing lemming. Trouble was, he didn’t make any effort to tackle him, or even try to wrap his arms around him. In the end it was like watching a runaway truck colliding with a telegraph pole. They both came tumbling down.World Rugby’s tackle directives could not be any clearer about a collision like this. Hodge did not use his arms, his shoulder collided with Yato’s head, and, since they had both been standing up, there were not really any mitigating circumstances.Dominiko Waqaniburotu, Fiji’s captain, said later he had asked the referee to have the TV match official, Rowan Kitt, take a look at it, and that O’Keeffe reported back that the Englishman had not seen anything. Online, though, one of the men who was involved in developing those new tackle guidelines, the South African sports scientist Ross Tucker, was unequivocal. In his opinion Hodge should have been sent off.Instead, it was Yato who had to go. He left the field for a head injury assessment on his concussion, which he failed. When he reappeared, it was only so he could lie flat on his back by the side of the field, distraught that it was all over for him. He is certain to miss Fiji’s next game, too, against Uruguay on Wednesday.Yato had been the best player on the pitch till that point, driving Fiji forward with his hard-charging runs through midfield. He had made three carries, two clean breaks, and beaten two defenders, for 81 metres. Now he was gone, the game slowly began to tilt back Australia’s way. Worse still, it was Hodge who scored the very next try, with a fine flying finish in the corner on the overlap.There’s no blame on Australia, here. They caught a break and made every use of it. Given the way they tightened up their play in the 20 minutes after half-time, when they settled down to a lot of dirty – and deadly effective – set‑piece work, they may well have won anyway.The problem is that what everyone understood to be true from World Rugby’s tackle directives, and what everyone saw play out on the pitch, just didn’t seem to square up with each other. And if the game doesn’t seem to make sense to people who already know and love it, what chance has everyone else got?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d73fba8baed373fa4d4933839034c45bd8e4a7/0_175_4402_2642/master/4402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1ccb2d93a455e070b0081a81afb9b1e","title":"new zealand v south africa rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"A first-half barrage of 17 points inside five minutes saw champions New Zealand overcome South Africa in a hugely physical and highly skilled Pool B opener in YokohamaThat’s it from me for today. Thanks very much for reading, emailing, and tweeting. As expected, it was a blockbuster day of rugby, with Fiji putting up a fine display against Australia, France and Argentina playing out a classic in Tokyo, before New Zealand’s class proved a little too much for a very dangerous-looking Springboks side in Yokohama. I’ll be back tomorrow for Ireland v Scotland - see you then!There was a furore earlier regarding a high tackle during Australia and Fiji.Read Andy Bull’s take on it:Here is a short clip of New Zealand bowing, in true Japanese fashion, to thank the fans in Yokohama after the final whistle:Italy take on Namibia tomorrow in this very pool and there will surely be only one winner there. Looking beyond that, Italy are the only other side in this group who can hope to trouble either NZ or SA. South Africa take on Italy on Friday 4 October, and New Zealand play them on Saturday 12 October in the final pool match for both teams. Essentially, barring some incredible occurrence, New Zealand have clinched victory in Pool B today.Highlights of France v Argentina, for those needing. It was a belter:Beauden Barrett was named the official Player of the Match, and he had a fine game. But how good was Cheslin Kolbe?He made 118 metres, beat 11 defenders and made nine carries across the 80 minutes. Pretty, pretty good:Don’t forget to bookmark this page for the rest of the tournament: Our guide to the pools and results:Bryan Habana on South Africa’s performance: “There was so much encouragement in the first 20 minutes ... there was a clear plan and a lot of physicality. The Boks will be disappointed, their errors at crucial times let them down. It’s sort of one that got away. When you’re playing at the pinnacle of the game, against the No 1 side, those margins have to be better than 99 per cent.“Cheslin Kolbe, we need him to get his hands on the ball as much as possible, and you wonder what could have happened if he got more ball. You felt for him that he couldn’t get into the game more.”“We are outside Tonteldoos a small village in South Africa, following the game thanks to your feed! Our signal is intermittent so we keep closing and re-opening the page cheering for the #springboks thank you! Kerryn and Ian.”It was a brave effort from your team today and they look well-placed to have a good run in Japan - even if they end up second in the pool. They clearly have the firepower to potentially add another World Cup to the collection. Siya Kolisi: “We stuck to our guns.”Kieran Read: “It was a heck of a Test match.”If you missed it here is the France v Argentina report from earlier:“Two thoughts: 1) The All Blacks might see this out but the Springboks have physically dominated this contest, with awesome power and intensity. 2) I think I’m going to help myself to a second macaroon shortly.”That’s interesting Paul (not so much the macaroon but hope you enjoy it). The South Africans were very physical, it’s true, but the All Blacks’ skills showed that will only get you so far. When they have a couple of yards, the All Blacks’ backs (and forwards for that matter) are just ludicrously good at exploiting space and punishing the opposition. When South Africa watch the tape it will be pretty easy to identify the errors that allowed New Zealand into the match. Before that, they had an absolute strangehold on proceedings. But also, it’s a bit of an exaggeration to say South Africa physically dominated, in my humble opinion.Thanks for joining us, Jay.Jonny Wilkinson: “South Africa turned around the momentum after half-time, which was impressive. But they missed a couple of chances. And no team seems to dominate New Zealand in the last 20.” Sean Fitzpatrick on New Zealand’s efforts: “Other than the Du Toit try, they were pretty clinical. They will go away now and build through the tournament. They have got their big game out of the way. I think everyone played pretty well ... The Mo’Unga and Barrett combination created opportunities, and that’s what they wanted.”“Thank you New Zealand.”Hats off South Africa, too. Did we just watch a rehearsal of the final?Thanks for all your emails, by the way. There are tonnes from all over the world. I’ll try and get a few in in the next few minutes, along with some reaction from players and coaches to New Zealand’s 10-point Pool B win.Wonderful match. South Africa took it to New Zealand, in both halves, but the All Blacks were probably a little more clinical, and gave up fewer penalties, and that meant they had too much in the end. As a result, it looks certain that New Zealand will top Pool B, and face the runners-up from Pool A in the quarter-finals. That could be Ireland, Scotland or even Japan. Ireland take on Scotland tomorrow so the picture will be a little clearer after that.79 min: Defensive scrum for South Africa. They win a penalty, but time is up. Pollard has time to kick for touch, though, and they will have time to try and get over the try-line even if it’s a consolation.78 min: It’s no surprise that both teams are tired and the game is breaking up a bit - but the All Blacks have retained the ball superbly well for the past three minutes. With South Africa’s rush defence, it’s hard to maintain the same intensity for 80 minutes. New Zealand lead by 10 and they have got over the line in this one.77 min: Ball in hand for the All Blacks. They are closing this one out, working through the phases and making progress into the Boks’ half.75 min: Kolbe again makes a great run on the right wing, deep into the All Blacks’ 22. But he’s so quick, South Africa can’t get support there fast enough when he’s finally tackled, and New Zealand turn it over. That could be crucial. Inside the final five minutes and it’s still a 10-point game. Kolbe has been one of the stars for South Africa, but you sense they needed a score from that attack if they are going to get back on terms.The Boks are punished for being offside. New Zealand lead by 10. They’ve given up three penalties, South Africa have given up eight, and that has hurt this Boks comeback. But there is still time.71 min: Sonny Bill Williams is charged down, trying a cross-kick from inside his own half, but the All Blacks were enjoying a penalty advantage. Meanwhile there is a break in play because try-scorer Pieter-Steph du Toit is injured. Plenty of time left in this one. Barrett is going to take on a penalty for offside ...70 min: The All Blacks have taken the sting out of a spirited recovery by South Africa - just for the moment. Inside the final 10 minutes and they still have a seven-point lead. Etzebeth comes off, for RG Snyman. Barrett snipes in midfield for the All Blacks. Rassie Erasmus’s side need the ball back if they are going to win.68 min: TJ Perenara has come on for Aaron Smith for New Zealand. The All Blacks win another penalty, this time under a bit of pressure from the Boks, and they kick for touch near halfway.Super kick. New Zealand find an answer after a lot of South African pressure, thanks to that scrum penalty, and give themselves a seven-point cushion, with 14 minutes left on the clock. 64 min: In replacements news, Trevor Nyakane, Francois Louw and Jesse Kriel are on for South Africa. New Zealand win a penalty at that aforementioned scrum and Mo’Unga now has a chance to make their lead seven points instead of four.63 min: A scrum for South Africa 10 metres inside their own half. It’s reset. This could be a handy attacking position for them, and the backs await expectantly.62 min: Thank you for reading, Cheta Nwanze:“Following this feed from Nigeria. Rugby isn’t big here. Rooting for the All Blacks. Love the haka. Crush ‘ em boys!”61 min: Here is an explanation of the troubles some New Zealand fans are having, trying to watch this match:Awesome kick. South Africa do indeed find the next score. Pollard casually, nonchalantly strokes this drop-goal over after finding a couple of seconds to take aim - a reflection of how well his team-mates had tested the All Blacks’ defence in the previous phases of play. Just superb. A four-point game! Bring it on!58 min: Approaching the final 20 and South Africa have come storming back into this. If they can get the next score the finale is going to be seriously nervy for both sets of fans. Who will top Pool B? South Africa have the ball in hand and go through the phases just outside the All Blacks’ 22.56 min: An email from New Zealand!“Hi from NZ - Love this live feed as I can’t watch the games right now from NZ sadly! Loving the commentary! Great work keep it up and go the All Blacks. Hannah McAlley.”We hope you find a TV for the rest of the tournament, Hannah, and thanks for reading!52 min: Now it’s really warming up. De Klerk storms down the middle of the pitch for South Africa, and off-loads to the right, to Willie Le Roux. It looked forward, but the ref didn’t see it, and the crowd noise is deafening as the Boks fans roar their team back into this match. Then, the All Blacks turn it over, and Barrett chips forward on the right wing, but the Boks’ defence manage to cover. End-to-end stuff. The All Blacks lead by seven.50 min: Dane Coles off, Codie Taylor on at hooker for the All Blacks. Sonny Bill Williams has also come on for Ryan Crotty and Ofa Tuungafasi and Angus Ta’avao are also on - the entire front row has been switched by Hansen.Hello. South Africa right back in it. Kolbe’s brilliant run, which gained so much territory, pays off in the end. There is a ruck about eight metres from the All Blacks’ try-line, and du Toit simply spots there is no-one behind it for New Zealand, who are more concerned with covering the try-line to the left and right. Du Toit lopes over for an easy score. And it’s game on as Pollard adds the extras - that was a slightly bizarre lapse by the All Blacks and their defence coaches will be livid.46 min: Wow! That man Kolbe, the Springbok wing, is in the thick of it again. He storms down the right wing and makes 60 metres, jinking right and left, but is denied a try by an excellent covering tackle near the corner. 44 min: Kolbe fails to take a mark from an up-and-under in the 22. The All Blacks have a line-out and look to put it through the hands, but it breaks loose and Faf de Klerk hacks the ball clear. “Arrived in Washington DC yesterday for a week long trip to the US...Was super disappointed in my planning when every DC pub I called in the last week confirmed they were not opening up for the game. Maybe it’s a good thing in the end... Thanks for the coverage! (SA supporter from London).”Glad to be of service, Patrick. Oh! Now we’ve got a Mexican Wave in the stadium as the packs scrum down.41 min: All Blacks full-back Barrett has just taken a boot in the face and has a nosebleed. It was accidental - he went low into a tackle. He is not interested in going off, though.Here we go ... Handre Pollard restarts the match. Can South Africa find a way back?A touch of half-time analysis from the ITV nerve centre:Sean Fitzpatrick: “South Africa have to take the game to New Zealand. You have to put them under pressure.”Don’t forget - you can email me or tweet me, as above, with any thoughts on the match. See you in five.And here is Paul Rees previewing Ireland v Scotland, which takes place tomorrow:Half-time reading from Andy Bull:It was a half of two halves. South Africa ended the half making headway in the All Blacks’ 22, but it ended with a knock-on, which rather sums up the way the match has gone for them to this point. The 1995 and 2007 champions raced out of the blocks in the first half in Yokohama, and New Zealand initially looked a little taken aback at the intensity with which their opponents threw themselves into it. Pollard notched an early penalty, but when a pass went astray as they sought to extend their lead, the balance of the match switched in a moment. Once New Zealand were on the board, on 22 minutes, they showcased the kinds of skills which has allowed them to win the previous two tournaments and ran in two fine tries inside five minutes - and scored 17 points in total in a five-minute burst. South Africa aren’t out of it yet, though, by any stretch. 38 min: Mo’Unga misses a penalty attempt. Then there’s another South African knock-on. For his part, their coach Rassie Erasmus must be frustrated. His team spent 20 minutes on the front foot, but a few errors now see them with plenty of ground to make up.37 min: The All Blacks’ social media editor will be busy if they keep running in these tries.34 min: The match is opening up now. Smith puts a high box kick up, which is claimed by Savea on the left wing, and the All Blacks then pass it right around the halfway line. It’s nearly an interception for South Africa but it ends with a knock-on. That passage of play might have ended with a try for either side.32 min: With Mo’Unga at 10 and Barrett at 15, the All Blacks have terrifying options in attack. South Africa had a stranglehold on this match early, but a couple of errors have been punished in exceptional style. Steve Hansen will be liking what he sees, certainly past the 20-minute mark.More sublime skills from the world champions, and another try, right under the posts. After dominating the first 20, South Africa are now staring at a potential hammering. It was Anton Lienert-Brown who found a few yards of space near halfway, jinked around a couple of tackles, and then found Barrett who was lurking on his right shoulder. The second-rower Barrett had a clear run in to the line and Mo’Unga adds a simple conversion. South Africa need to take a breath and regather themselves.That was brilliant. Reece fields a kick and makes ground on the right wing, sprinting over halfway, then the All Blacks spin it left through Smith and Savea. Barrett then slinks into the 22 with the South African defence stretched, takes the ball into contact, and off-loads clinically to put Bridge in for the first try of the match, and of their World Cup title defence. That is what they can do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4da596a805af995a16f08595c7481e510388e47/0_0_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=026bdd479b28357c2f050da20e63a8ec","title":"brad pitt snoop dogg asap rocky peaky blinders steven knight gangster series","story":"The world’s biggest stars are queuing up to be cast in the dandy gangster series. Ahead of the finale, creator Steven Knight talks about the show’s ‘bizarre, dream-like’ boomFrom the streets of Small Heath, Birmingham, to the news stands of Bogotá, we are now living in a Peaky Blinders world.The BBC first broadcast Steven Knight’s series about a gang of razor blade-wielding dandies in 2013. Six years later, its star Cillian Murphy, in character as Tommy Shelby, adorns the cover of Rolling Stone Colombia.The final episode of the fifth season will be shown on BBC One on Sunday evening, as the Shelbys tussle with fascist MP Oswald Mosley and a rival gang from Glasgow called the Billy Boys.As the Blinders scale new levels of popularity, thanks in no small part to Netflix streaming the show in 183 countries, it is no surprise to hear that A-list stars are contacting Knight asking to join the cast.“We get a lot of people who get in touch and want to take part,” he says. “There’s Brad Pitt. Snoop Dogg. A$AP Rocky, too. I think in series six we will open the door a little to get some celebrity actors in. The main thing is they have to be good. We’ll just get the best actor for the part, as we did with Sam Claflin, who plays Mosley. He’s perfect.”He does, however, rule out cameos for their own sake. “I always find it difficult when the audience knows a person from somewhere else and they just drop in. It’s very distracting.”Could he be referring to Ed Sheeran’s much-maligned appearance in Game of Thrones? “Well, there are some casualties along the road,” he says.Knight confirms Mosley will return in the sixth season and goes on to say that he has as good as cast an actor in the role of Diana Mitford, second wife to the leader of the British Union of Fascists, the party Mosley founded in 1932.While the Peaky Blinders are roughly based on a real-life gang and their enemies – former adversaries Billy Kimber and Darby Sabini did exist – the plot has played fast and loose with facts. With Mosley, the most well-known character depicted, Knight says his storyline will be more historically accurate.“What I’m trying to do is take history, and the specific things history notices, then write around the things that aren’t so known,” he says. “So Mosley was having an affair with his wife’s sister and stepmother, but history doesn’t count that, that isn’t what we know him for. But who the hell does that? He was charismatic and magnetic, which made his message seductive and enabled him to draw people in. I want to make people see that evil is seductive and that we need to be careful.“The rise of fascism, racism, national socialism and populism ... it’s happening now,” continues Knight. “I looked at Mosley’s speeches, and one of them began ‘Do not believe false news.’ He was telling people that the media was lying to them, that foreigners were taking things away from them. It’s my good fortune – but the world’s bad fortune – that these things are happening again and I can write about them. I just hope people realise that nine years after Mosley started making these speeches there was a world war. Let’s not do it again.”Knight is speaking at the the Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival and standing about 50 feet from the first reported crime by a Peaky Blinder – an assault in March 1890, years before the events depicted in the show. On the street below, there are thousands of fans dressed in period attire in tribute to their favourite characters.“It’s bizarre,” he says. “It’s like a dream.” A huge draw across the Midlands, there are fans from all over the UK, from France and Belgium. Earlier in the day, Knight met one fan who had travelled from Los Angeles.“It’s a whole world we’ve created, it’s more than just clothes and a good soundtrack,” he says. “I do lots of projects in film and TV. You have some that are lucky, and some that are unlucky. Peaky is the luckiest project I’ve ever been involved with. Every time we leap forward a couple of years, we hit a period of history that has such resonance. None more so than the current series. I don’t plan these things that far ahead, it just happens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54119e76c9a0c77ad87768fec42e81144e592c44/0_136_4285_2571/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b25c90f00ce68eb4eae89301e92800f1","title":"strictly come dancing","story":"Still camp, still just on the edge of true glamour, and still entirely baffling to the lay viewerStrictly returns, and with it all of the traditions of autumn: conkers, stewed apples, the smell of smoke on the air, a kid turning up to school in mittens six weeks after blowing his fingers off with a firework, truffling for hedgehogs under dormant bonfire piles, wondering which celebrities are going to shag each other after a 10-week stint of rubbing up crotch-to-crotch in sequinned Lycra catsuits. Still hosted by Claudia Winkleman (once you defeat all the other fun aunts in combat, you must defeat Winkleman, the funnest aunt of all) and Tess Daly (what if a witch cursed a can of Elnett to live as a person?), still camp, still right on the edge of true glamour, still entirely baffling to the lay viewer, ie me.Strictly Come Dancing (Sat, 7pm, BBC One) is a lightheartedly competitive dance show that is still rigorously ruled by ancient stone tablets engraved with edicts and stored in a holy room at the back of the BBC archives ones that producers are too scared to deviate from in case they bring down an ancient blood curse like the one that already claimed Jamie Laing’s foot. So: Thou Shalt Always Hath a Slightly Clumsy Former Competitive Athlete Who Is Like 6’ 4” And Rhythmless (James Cracknell, David James) Thou Shalt Always Hath a Soap Actress Who Really Really Wants This (Catherine Tyldesley, Emma Barton) Thou Shalt Hath a Cheerful-Faced Breakfast TV Sub-Presenter Who Shall Dad Dance Throughout, Out By Week Two (Mike Bushell) Thou Shalt Hath a Comedian Who Will Never Quite Decide If He Wants To Be “Comedy-Bad” Or Just “Bad-Bad” (Chris Ramsey) Wherever Possible, Thou Shalt Hath Anneka Rice (Anneka Rice). This is a show that had to drip feed the idea of having Claudia Winkleman replace a 1,000-year-old Bruce Forsyth by having her alternate one-week-on, one-week-off for an entire series just so the viewing public wouldn’t riot. It is not a show that is built for change.Good, then, that the Strictly discourse is still what it is. To catch you up, say if you get into conversation with a Strictly fan at a dinner party (?), here are the main flare-ups: the sheer idea of a same-sex dancing partnership is so revolutionary that, if the BBC were to ever do it, an entire swathe of middle England would die instantly of a mass anger heart attack they have started letting vloggers on and nobody knows who these vloggers are Craig Revel Horwood, a man hired to be as decisively mean as it is possible to be without moving your jaw, is simply too decisively mean the one competitor who has previous dancing experience is too good and they are ruining it. The other constants: Tess Daly’s hand gestures, akin to a robot trying to overcome its pre-programmed desire to strangle all of the male professional dancers looking like those F1 drivers who only ever last one season the lad they have on who appears to be an actual vampire who everyone seems to ignore due to the fact that he is an actual vampire Anton du Beke still there, the ghost at the feast everyone trying to do elastic “dancing faces”, like your uncle playing charades and trying to convey the phrase “fatal orgasm”.

We just don’t know how many.”Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the event “a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies and the desire to know what we don’t know”.The result, Borer said, was “hope and fear” for events that include the “Area 51 Basecamp” featuring music, speakers and movies in Hiko, and festivals in Rachel and Las Vegas competing for the name Alienstock.“People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,” Borer said. “Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can’t go. When you tell people they can’t do something, they just want to do it more.”Eric Holt, the Lincoln county emergency manager overseeing preparations, said he believed authorities could handle a total of 30,000 visitors to Rachel and Hiko.Still, neighbors braced for trouble after millions of people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against “critters, snakes and scorpions”.“It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry,” Arnu said.

However, police are continuing their investigations to try to find out who ordered the killing, and why.The Malta government said the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, had appointed retired judge Michael Mallia to preside over the inquiry. He would be assisted by a law professor and a retired forensics expert.The government said that the independent review must not prejudice the active criminal investigation. It added that the inquiry should conclude its work within nine months.Muscat, a frequent target of Caruana Galizia’s writings, has offered a €1m ($1.1m) reward for information leading to the arrest of those behind her killing.Caruana Galizia published accusations of corruption, money laundering and influence-peddling by people at the highest levels of Maltese society, all of which they denied.Her family have repeatedly demanded a public inquiry, saying it was the best hope of uncovering the truth.

A Houthi military spokesman described the assault as a serious escalation and a reprisal for the Houthi-claimed assault on Saudi oil installations last weekend.Defending the attacks, the Saudi coalition spokesman, Turki Al-Malik, said: “The coalition’s naval forces detected an attempt by the terrorist Houthi militia backed by Iran to carry out an imminent act of aggression and terrorism in the southern Red Sea using an unmanned, rigged boat ... launched from Hodeidah province.”The Saudi attacks were seen by the Houthis as an attempted show of strength in response to the last Saturday’s devastating assault on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities, a strike that exposed the vulnerability of the Saudi oilfields to terrorism.The Houthis continue to claim responsibility for the attack on the facilities which temporarily knocked out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production capacity, and raised deep questions about Saudi Arabia’s ability to press ahead with its IPO sale. Videos showing cars queuing for petrol in Saudi Arabia were posted on social media.Both Riyadh and Washington are continuing to point the finger directly at Iran, with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, describing the attack as an act of war by Tehran.3m people forced to flee their homes.85,000 -\u0026nbsp Save the Children estimate that this number of children under the age of 5 may have died through hunger and malnutrition.1m cases of cholera in 2017, the largest outbreak of the disease in recent history. 2,200 people died during it. A resurgence of the disease saw more than 137,000 suspected cases and almost 300 deaths in the first three months of 2019.Over 91,600 fatalities since the conflict started in 2015, as measured by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project.19,990 recorded air raids since the conflict began\u0026nbsp£770m - the amount of foreign aid given by Britain in food, medicines and other assistance to civilians over the last half a decade.£6.2bn - the amount of money Britain has earned in the same period selling arms to the Saudis and their coalition partners.Four UN weapons experts have arrived in Saudi Arabia, at the invitation of the government, to examine the weapons used in the assault on the two sites at Abqaiq and Khurais. Two of the experts have previous knowledge of the weapons used in the four-year Yemen civil war.The Saudi government also took representatives from international media to Abqaiq and Khurais to show the extraordinary scale of the damage and assure that the sites would be back to full production capacity within a month or two.Riyadh told reporters that the assaults, a mixture of cruise missiles and drones, came from the direction of Iran and the weaponry deployed is not in the possession of the Houthis.Saudi Arabia has not identified the precise point from which the attack was launched, but unnamed US intelligence sources claim it was southern Iran, and the attack was undertaken with the knowledge of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said such such claims are false and designed to distract attention from Saudi breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen.The focus of the dispute is likely to move next week to New York where Zarif is expected to meet European foreign ministers, including the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, at the UN general assembly. The chances of a direct meeting between the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and Donald Trump is ruled out by Iran, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is likely to try to act as a mediator between the two sides since he will hold bilateral meetings with both men.Seeking a resolution is complicated by the political chaos inside the Saudi-backed Yemen government, as well as a dispute between Yemen and one of its nominal supporters, the United Arab Emirates. In a sign of the collapse of trust, Yemen’s transport minister, Saleh Al-Jubwani, accused the UAE on twitter of supporting al-Qaida in Yemen to undermine the government.Yemen’s president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, issued a decree on Thursday evening appointing new foreign and finance ministers in a cabinet reshuffle to lead the key state institutions. He appointed the former ambassador Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed Al-Hadrami as minister of foreign affairs, replacing Khaled al-Yamani, who resigned last June. He also appointed the fourth head of the Central Bank in as many years.In London Boris Johnson met the emir of Qatar on Saturday and in a statement from No 10 stressed Downing Street is seeking to de-escalate the crisis through negotiation.

Police fired teargas at protesters and dismantled makeshift barricades set up by protesters with plastic and metal roadside barriers while protesters threw petrol bombs in retaliation. Police said in Twitter posts that “radical protesters threw petrol bombs” and possessed “offensive weapons including metal rods, slingshots and laser guns” during the confrontations.About an hour into the protest, riot police charged towards a group of protesters and arrested a number of people. Many others got into a stand-off with police behind barricades they built earlier. Scuffles also broke out between the police and protesters near a light rail station after some demonstrators were accused of shining laser pointers at officers. They used fire hoses to spray water while police retaliated with pepper spray and fired several rounds of sponge bullets at them. Police said in a Twitter post that the protesters damaged the station facilities with metal rods and hurled objects into the track.Earlier, protesters near Tuen Mun town hall lowered the Chinese flag, trampled on it and set it on fire.The Saturday protest earlier in the afternoon targeted dance performances in a local park often staged by mostly mainland Chinese women but protesters were also venting their anger over escalating police violence in recent protests and calling for broader political rights.“Five demands, not one less!” chanted the mostly black-clad protesters, referring to their demands which include the setting up of an independent commission to investigate police brutality and universal suffrage. They also sang songs aimed at provoking the police.Earlier this month, the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, withdrew the controversial anti-extradition bill that sparked the wave of protests in June, but the move failed to calm unrest. The protests had by then morphed into a wider and more violent anti-government movement as resentment mounted against the police and the government, which used threats and escalating force to deal with protesters. The bill, if passed, would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.The local metro station was closed by the authorities before the event on Saturday, making it harder for protesters to reach and leave the area. The city’s transit operator, MTR Corp, has also closed the train station at Yuen Long, where a sit-in was planned earlier to commemorate an indiscriminate attack carried out by pro-China gangsters on commuters two months ago. Earlier on Saturday, dozens of pro-China supporters tore down “Lennon Walls” of large collages of colourful anti-government protest messages in several districts. The installations have blossomed across Hong Kong, on and under footbridges, along pedestrian walkways, at bus stops and shopping centres. A pro-Beijing city legislator, Junius Ho, who has been a vocal critic of the protests, had urged his supporters to clean up the approximately 100 Lennon Walls around the city on Saturday.The anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing on Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including the right of assembly and an independent judiciary.China says it is committed to the arrangement and denies interfering. It has accused foreign governments including the US and Britain, of inciting the unrest.The demonstrations have turned ugly and tend to peak on the weekends, often with anti-government activists, many masked and in black, throwing petrol bombs at police, trashing metro stations, blocking airport roads and lighting street fires. At times, they have been confronted by supporters of Beijing wielding sticks.

Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyNews outlets were advised by the Department of Finance that the meeting between Paschal Donohoe and his UK counterpart, Sajid Javid, on Thursday would be a photo opportunity only. No provision for media questions.This did not deter the reporters, who trooped along anyway in the hope of getting a few Brexit-related lines from the two money men.Paschal was first to arrive because he had to perform the big welcome under the portico. There were no security restrictions in place, apart from a roped-off area for photographers in front of Farmleigh House. On such a lovely day, visitors were enjoying the grounds around the estate, including a seven-strong group of women on a day trip from Thurles. When they noticed the media activity, they went for a closer look and saw the Minister for Finance, dimples dancing in the sunlight.With a few minutes to spare, the politician in Paschal found it impossible to resist this pleasant group of ladies waving and calling his name. He ambled over.An adviser let slip that it was his birthday. He’s 45. There were photographs taken and then the Thurles contingent serenaded the beaming Minister with a very harmonious warbling of Happy Birthday.“Thank you very much!”This touching interlude gave the scheming hacks an idea. They knew that unless they could grab the attention of one of the Ministers, any shouted questions would be smilingly ignored.Javid landed and the handshakes commenced. In time-honoured tradition, the politicians studiously ignored the journalists. Suddenly a voice bellowed, Downing Street-style, from the rabble.“Chancellor, do you know it’s the Minister’s birthday?”The chancellor instinctively pivoted, a manoeuvre more usually associated with his boss and the truth.Looking momentarily terrified by this briefing oversight, the UK visitor quickly regained his composure. In the rocky world of British-Irish relations in these Brexit-strained times, Paschal and Sajid have had three meetings in recent weeks. That almost makes them best pals.“Yes. I bought him a present but I can’t tell you what it is,” he told Virgin Media’s Gavan Reilly. Contact established, the men were drawn into a reluctant exchange.Might the present involve the unwrapping of some common ground on Brexit? And what did both sides think of a speech made by UK Brexit secretary Steve Barclay in Madrid earlier in the day?So the finance ministers were forced into saying nothing of import, but on the record, about the special relationship between Ireland and the UK while simultaneously avoiding any public comment on Barclay’s robust remarks.A belated happy birthday to the deputy for Dublin Central and we hope he gets to enjoy a nice meal and a few pints this weekend. Young Paschal (45) spent the night of his birthday in a meeting on Brexit with Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed.From Labour to lobbyistFormer Labour senator and general election candidate Lorraine Higgins will be appointed Honorary Consul to the Slovak Republic at a reception in the embassy in Merrion Square on Thursday.

She filled the gap left by the departure of former Fine Gael media director and ministerial adviser Ciarán Conlon, who left for Microsoft.Speaking of fierce big jobs, former taoiseach Enda Kenny’s chief of staff, Mark Kennelly, landed what many would call a dream gig this week when he was appointed the first chief executive of Golf Ireland. The Kerry man is a member of Killarney Golf and Fishing Club.With all the work he has to do, not least with the Ryder Cup in Adare on the horizon, Mark will hardly have time to swing a club.Knock, Knock, Leo’s thereLeo Varadkar has settled into the routine once faithfully followed by general election specialist Bertie Ahern, travelling around the country on available Fridays to get maximum exposure in the local mediaThis week Leo went to Mayo, starting in Knock airport before taking in Castlebar, Ballina and Shrule near the Galway border.He cut the ribbon on Knock airport’s refurbished runway. Just as well the runway is the third-largest in the country because a lot of tarmac was needed to accommodate the amount of dignitaries gathered for the ceremony.Leo retold the story of how townie politicians dismissed Msgr James Horan’s grand vision for an airport and how a Fine Gael minister (it was the late Jim Mitchell) famously described the site in 1984 as “far distant from any sizeable town, high on a foggy, boggy hill”.More than 30 years on, Ireland West Airport is proof “that white elephants can fly”. A comforting thought, perhaps, for a Taoiseach constantly battling criticism of government infrastructure projects.The parish priest of Knock, Fr Richard Gibbons, thought Leo might need some ine intervention on the Brexit situation.“Taoiseach, I know you’re going to New York next week and meeting Boris Johnson,” he smiled, before handing him a tiny bottle. “A small little bit of added protection for you.”To applause and much guffawing, Leo held up the holy water. “Do I throw it over him or what?”“Oh, you can, you can!” laughed Fr Gibbons.Apparently the good father’s harmless joke has now gone viral, outraged Brexiteers are losing the plot on social media and the permanently indignant are having a field day over the Catholic Church’s stance on homosexuality.Ploughing off courseWe bumped into Mattie McGrath at the National Ploughing Championships on Thursday afternoon. He seemed in a rush and somewhat hot and bothered.The independent TD for Tipperary and member of the Dáil’s Rural Independents Group explained that he had only just arrived. He had hoped to get in much earlier but there had been a bit of a mix-up and they got lost in the car on the way to Fenagh. Which is why we found him barrelling up the steel walkway at speed, wearing his full suit in the sweltering conditions.“I hadn’t time to change,” he said.It seems Mattie took a lift with his Fianna Fáil colleague and TD for Cork East, Kevin O’Keeffe. Kevin put on the GPS and off they went, following the satnav directions to the letter.When the two boys reached their “destination” they knew they had veered substantially off course.According to Mattie, when Kevin keyed in “National Ploughing Association”, the satnav took them to the gates of Anna May McHugh’s farmhouse in Laois. The indomitable Anna May is the power behind the Ploughing.McGrath wasn’t overly concerned about arriving late but O’Keeffe was anxious to link up with the Fianna Fáil contingent and show his face before his leader Micheál Martin left the scene.Ross has a lot on his plateWhen Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan waylaid Shane Ross after the first Cabinet meeting of the new season and presented him with a commemorative plate featuring Shankill Garda station, the Minister for Transport looked most gratified.But it was all a little strange. Had it been specially commissioned? Why would Charlie Flanagan do this when Ross has been the bane of his life with his crusade over reopening Shankill Garda station along with his determination to push the Judicial Appointments Bill through the Oireachtas, no matter how long Flanagan has endured the Seanad filibuster against it.It wasn’t a special piece. The Minister for Justice spotted it while browsing through bric-a-brac in an antiques shop while on holidays in Connemara. The plate was part of a series featuring scenes from south Co Dublin. Charlie wasn’t keen on buying the complete set so he stuck a deal with the owner and came away with the one he wanted.While it clearly wasn’t too expensive, the Minister is refusing to say how much he paid.Charlie and Shane are both beaming broadly as the gift is handed over in Government Buildings. That was nearly three weeks ago, before the Minister for Transport knew Stepaside Garda station would not be open to the public on a 24-hour basis, despite his assurances to the contrary.Only one of them is smiling now. And it isn’t Ross, but at least he has a new china plate to hang on the wall.Big in JapanThe sense of drift in the nation will be reversed on Tuesday, September 24th, when Seanad Éireann finally gets back to business after the summer break.All Senators are expected to muster for duty, including the four from Fine Gael who flew to Japan for two weeks for the Parliamentary World Cup rugby tournament. The Dáil and Seanad XV made it to the semi-finals, winning the Plate match against Japan. New Zealand took the honours.No TDs went on the trip, with the Fine Gael four the only elected representatives on a team drawn in the main from Leinster House staff.The Senators have been quick to point out they travelled when the Upper House was in recess and everyone paid their own way – flights, accommodation, insurance and specially made deckchair-striped Alickadoo jackets.Neale Richmond, sporting the remains of a black eye, took a break from his sporting holiday to brief business leaders on EU Brexit developments at a conference in Japan’s Keizai Koho Forum. He also met government trade representatives in Tokyo. The other Senators on the trip were Catherine Noone from Dublin, Maria Byrne from Limerick and Tony Lawless from Kildare.While the politicians may have paid their own way, it hasn’t stopped a few Fine Gael eyebrows rising in their absence. Three of them – Richmond (Dublin-Rathdown), Noone (Dublin Bay North) and Lawless (Kildare South) – are running in the general election, and some party colleagues are wondering about the wisdom of taking off for Japan with talk in the air of a snap election in eight weeks’ time.The travelling party seems to have had a great time. A Japanese commuter posted a video on Twitter of the tired-looking team lustily singing The Black Velvet Band while on the Tokyo underground (Hanzomon Line). It is a sight to behold."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4026238.1569066602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk labour deputy leader survives bid to oust him over brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe deputy leader of Britain’s Labour Party survived an attempt to oust him over Brexit. File Photograph: Jonathan BradyPA Wire  The deputy leader of Britain’s Labour Party survived an attempt to oust him over Brexit on Saturday after party chief Jeremy Corbyn moved to defuse a row that threatened to overshadow the party’s bid to show it was ready for power.Holding its annual party conference just weeks before UK prime minister Boris Johnson has promised “do or die” to lead Britain out of the European Union, Labour was keen to set out its agenda for government rather than put its Brexit isions on display.But a move by Mr Corbyn’s ally Jon Lansman, founder of the left-wing grassroots movement Momentum, to propose a motion to abolish the deputy’s post because of disloyalty over Brexit threatened to derail those plans.The attempt only underlined the deep isions in Britain’s main opposition party over Brexit, rifts that have also fractured the governing Conservative Party and have cast doubt over when, how or whether Brexit will take place on October 31st.Deputy leader Tom Watson, who has often criticised Mr Corbyn, described the attempt as “a drive-by shooting” after he challenged the Labour leader’s position on Brexit and suggested a second referendum should be held before any new election.A Labour source said Mr Corbyn, who backs an election first, had intervened just as the party gathered for the annual conference in the seaside resort of Brighton.“Jeremy Corbyn proposed that the motion not go to a vote and instead that there be a review of the position of deputy leader and other positions in support of the leader,” the source said.BlindsideThe motion, which appeared to blindside Corbyn’s team, had provoked criticism from Labour figures, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, as Britain heads towards a possible parliamentary election to unlock the Brexit impasse.“We must focus on fighting against Boris Johnson \u0026amp his catastrophic no-deal Brexit, not each other,” Mr Khan tweeted.Britain’s decision to back leaving the EU in a 2016 referendum has ided not only the country’s main political parties, but its towns and cities and often families. More than three years on, little is clear on how Brexit will happen.Mr Johnson has said he will take Britain out of the bloc on October 31st with or without a deal to smooth the country’s biggest trade and foreign policy shift for more than 40 years.Labour, and other opposition parties, have tried to prevent him from being able to stage a potentially damaging no-deal Brexit, refusing to back his call for a new election until the prospect of leaving without an agreement is taken off the table.Labour said in a draft statement on Brexit that if the party won power, it would “get Brexit sorted one way or another within six months of coming to power”.The statement, yet to be agreed at the conference in the seaside resort of Brighton, sets out that a Labour government would “secure a sensible leave deal with the EU within three months, and within six months would put it before the people in a referendum alongside the option to remain.” –Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.British victim of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein speaks out over her ordeal Extinction Rebellion protesters cause \u0026#39carnage\u0026#39 by \u0026#39gluing\u0026#39 themselves to A20 exit road near Port of DoverComment: The unprecedented intimidation tactics of the ultra-Remainers are damaging our democracy Battle of Arnhem anniversary: Prince of Wales watches mass parachute dropEgypt\u0026#39s hardline president el-Sissi faces calls to quit in rare protestsYellow Vest protesters dig in for second winter as France braces for next round of Macron reformsLabour deputy leader Tom Watson condemns \u0026#39sectarian attack\u0026#39 after bid to oust himComment: The Remainer elite is laughing in the face of our historyComment: We are suffering from an overdose of reality - and it\u0026#39s TV\u0026#39s faultDiana\u0026#39s former private secretary: Prince Harry is following in his mother\u0026#39s footsteps – but must chart his own pathComment: We must challenge the intellectuals attacking meritocracy Comment: Many children grow up today never having left towns and cities to see our beautiful national parksComment: Life lessons in schools shouldn’t stop at stand-up comedyUnited States announces military response and Iran sanctions after attacks on Saudi oil facilitiesJohn Humphrys says BBC \u0026#39simply could not grasp\u0026#39 why anyone would vote for Brexit in new memoir   John McDonnell escalates Labour\u0026#39s \u0026#39class war\u0026#39 with pledge to abolish non-dom statusBrexit latest news: EU hatches plot to sink Britain\u0026#39s Brexit planYouTube \u0026#39kidfluencers\u0026#39 at risk of exploitation, Children\u0026#39s Commissioner warnsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"john humphrys says bbc simply could not grasp anyone would vote","story":"John Humphrys has accused the corporation of being out of touch with the nation in his memoirJohn Humphrys has lifted the lid on the BBC\u0027s institutional liberal bias and accused the corporation of being out of touch with the nation in his memoir.  The veteran broadcaster, who retired from Radio 4\u0027s Today show two days ago, says bosses badly failed to read the public\u0027s mood on Brexit and simply could not grasp why anybody voted Leave.In an extract published in The Daily Mail on Saturday, he recalled the morning after the referendum, writing: Leave had won – and this was not what the BBC had expected. Nor what it wanted.No nods and smiles when the big bosses appeared. No attempt to pretend that this was anything other than a disaster.In the book, called A Day Like Today, he adds: Bosses, almost to a man and woman, could simply not grasp how anyone could have put a cross in the Leave box on the referendum ballot paper.John Humphrys | Behind the micI’m not sure the BBC as a whole ever quite had a real grasp of what was going on in Europe, or of what people in this country thought about it.Humphrys describes the BBC as being terrified of offending ‘fashionable pressure groups – usually from the liberal left, the spiritual home of most bosses and staff.However, despite his misgivings, the 76-year-old says he has no doubt that the BBC remains a tremendous and irreplaceable force for good.Humphrys also reveals that he voted for Remain, after facing complaints that he was guilty of pro-Brexit bias during his BBC career.In another extract, he candidly addresses the broadcaster\u0027s handling of its gender pay gap row, saying it made the Today show a laughing stock.The son of French polisher father and a Welsh hairdresser mother, Humphrys earned a reputation as the broadcaster\u0027s rottweiler-in-chief after joining in 1967.He became a presenter on Today in 1987 after a career as a foreign correspondent and presenter of the Nine O\u0027Clock News. His last years in the job have been accompanied by scrutiny of his salary.  He took several pay cuts to bring his wages closer to those of his female colleagues.Writing in The  as Humphrys bowed out from the Today show on Thursday, the BBC director-general Lord Hall of Birkenhead said: There is perhaps no greater tribute than the collective sigh of relief that will be issued by leaders and public figures all around the country.Extinction Rebellion protesters cause \u0026#39carnage\u0026#39 by \u0026#39gluing\u0026#39 themselves to A20 exit road near Port of DoverComment: The unprecedented intimidation tactics of the ultra-Remainers are damaging our democracy Battle of Arnhem anniversary: Prince of Wales watches mass parachute dropEgypt\u0026#39s hardline president el-Sissi faces calls to quit in rare protestsYellow Vest protesters dig in for second winter as France braces for next round of Macron reformsLabour deputy leader Tom Watson condemns \u0026#39sectarian attack\u0026#39 after bid to oust himComment: The Remainer elite is laughing in the face of our historyDiana\u0026#39s former private secretary: Prince Harry is following in his mother\u0026#39s footsteps – but must chart his own pathComment: We are suffering from an overdose of reality - and it\u0026#39s TV\u0026#39s faultComment: We must challenge the intellectuals attacking meritocracy Comment: Many children grow up today never having left towns and cities to see our beautiful national parksComment: Life lessons in schools shouldn’t stop at stand-up comedyUnited States announces military response and Iran sanctions after attacks on Saudi oil facilitiesJohn McDonnell escalates Labour\u0026#39s \u0026#39class war\u0026#39 with pledge to abolish non-dom statusBrexit latest news: EU hatches plot to sink Britain\u0026#39s Brexit planYouTube \u0026#39kidfluencers\u0026#39 at risk of exploitation, Children\u0026#39s Commissioner warnsComment: With John Humphrys gone, who at the BBC will take the side of the listeners?Momentum chief ambushes Tom Watson and calls for Labour members to abolish his role as deputy leaderWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/09/10/TELEMMGLPICT000209039043_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqmRz2i0BYLgZHjHqS8l-QuXFrjSC-qITk4Nz7X9H1khI.jpeg?imwidth","title":"remainer elite laughing face history","story":"Controllers in Brussels have almost unchecked powerTrying to beat the Brexit blues, I travelled north to Bishop Auckland, County Durham, to see Kynren.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Rose will become the first chief executive of a major British high street bank when she replaces outgoing boss Ross McEwan on 31 October.\u0026nbspRBS will also be the only FTSE 100 company with women in its top two positions. Katie Murray is the lender\u0027s chief financial officer.\u0026nbspMs Rose, who is currently chief executive of RBS\u0027 commercial and private banking ision, as well as deputy CEO of NatWest,\u0026nbsphad been widely tipped for the top job.Thomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspDover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThree Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said.

They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said. Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRyanair pilots cancel strike action\u0026nbspRyanair says its UK-based pilots have cancelled five days of strikes planned for this month.\u0026nbspMembers of the Balpa union had set walkouts for September 21, 23,\u0026nbsp25, 27 and 29. They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

I have already asked the FE Commissioner to urgently look into this matter.“School and college leaders must treat taxpayers’ money with the utmost care and in a way that benefits their students. Where this does not happen we take the strongest possible action.”But Ms Mbubaegbu defended the expenses claimed for international travel saying the work was done to increase the college’s reputation overseas and to create additional income.“Chief executives of further education colleges have found ourselves under fire in recent years within a context in which there is extreme pressure to generate income to survive,” she said.In a statement, the principal said her foreign travel helped to attract £2.5m of additional income from international business development activities over the past four years. \u0026nbsp“The expenses referred to in the article were approved and authorised correctly and are also subject to independent audit in accordance with college procedures,” Ms Mbubaegbu said.The principal added that a large amount of the expenses was reimbursed to the college through grants or other funding and some expenses were to cover travel and CPD events for other staff.The figures come after a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) revealed this week that a government pledge to boost funding for\u0026nbspsixth forms\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcolleges\u0026nbspwill leave them £1.1bn short of what they need to reverse cuts felt over the past nine years.School sixth forms have faced budget cuts of 23 per cent since 2010-2011, and spending for colleges have declined by 12 per cent over the same period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star\u0027s mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star\u0027s core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsWhen stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red. These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star\u0027s mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star\u0027s core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction. Our own Milky Way galaxy is next expected to interact with another galaxy, the Andromeda, in four billion years. The two galaxies will eventually merge together to form a galaxy that scientists are already calling the MilkomedaMount Shasta in California as seen from 260 miles above earth onboard the International Space StationThe galaxy NGC 5866 is seen at a side angle.

Lets see them aliens.”The page developed in the same comedic manner, playing host to a variety of jokes and memes that sarcastically riffed on aliens and the secrets of the government.Storm Area 51 event could be disaster, locals fearBut it very quickly became very serious indeed. As interest in the Facebook page grew, so did anxiety that some people might really try to break into the base – and US Air Force spokesperson\u0026nbspLaura McAndrews\u0026nbspwas one of a number of officials who\u0026nbspgave a stern warning to anyone who did.Ms McAndrews added: “The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets”.Last month, the event disappeared from Facebook. It wasn’t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.It was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

accused of a Labour conference “stitch-up” to avoid a defeat that would prevent him ‘staying neutral’ in a fresh Brexit referendum.A new policy statement, likely to be agreed on Sunday, would avoid a decision until next year, until after a “sensible” withdrawal deal has been negotiated within three months of winning a general election.Only then would Labour decide its stance at a second referendum to be held within a further three months – possibly next May, if Boris Johnson holds a snap election in November.But pro-EU MPs and activists protested that the move was a clear attempt to stop them forcing Mr Corbyn to adopt an outright pro-Remain stance at the conference getting underway in Brighton.They had vowed to force an immediate showdown, armed with the 90 per cent of local party motions on Brexit which oppose the leader’s hopes of sitting on the fence.Bid to oust Watson as Labour deputy leader fails after backlashCritically, because the policy statement comes from the ruling national executive committee (NEC), it will – if passed – strike out those other 81 activist options.Created with Sketch.Labour Party conference 2018: in pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with

We would have to consider it seriously,” Ms Thornberry said.She also criticised Mr Corbyn’s intention to ‘stay neutral’ in a fresh referendum, saying: “I think it wouldn\u0027t be right for Labour to have no opinion on such a big decision.”The leadership’s blueprint would see a one-day special conference decide – eventually – Labour’s campaigning position, putting it in the hands of the unions and grassroots.If it wins an election, the party would seek a deal including a customs union, a “close relationship with the single market”, guarantees of workers’ rights and environmental protections, and membership of joint bodies on climate change, counter-terrorism and medicines.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

suggested attendees “all meet up” to “see them aliens” at the base which conspiracy theorists claim holds evidence of extraterrestrials.The event page was later shut down following condemnation from

Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.The entertainment kicked off weekend events that also feature a gathering Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Centre souvenir store in Hiko.Owner George Harris said it would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.Authorities reported no serious incidents related to the festivals, which were\u0026nbspscheduled to last until Sunday.Hiko and Rachel are about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u0027t know.YouTuber sentenced to jail after attempting to film Area 51People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve, he said. Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u0027t go. When you tell people they can\u0027t do something, they just want to do it more.Eric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the two events. Still, neighbours braced for trouble after more than two million people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time, said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against critters, snakes and scorpions, he warned.It will get cold at night. They\u0027re not going to find what they\u0027re looking for, and they are going to get angry, he added.The Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby airspace, although Air Force jets could be heard in the sun-drenched skies, along with an occasional sonic boom.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

tickets”.\u0026nbspThe original Facebook event, which began as a joke, attracted\u0026nbspmore than two million people who declared they were ready to enter Storm 51 “to see them aliens”.It sparked warnings from the US Air Force, which said it “stands ready to protect America and its interests” from anyone attempting to break into the site.The page was taken down last month but police were prepared for around 30,000 people to turn up on Friday. However only a few hundred made it to the gates to the facility, according to officials.Hundreds of people gather at Area 51 to ‘see them aliens’Five people were arrested, including two men who were found in the mountains inside the perimeter of base and a woman in her 60s who trespassed at one of the gates. Another 40 alien-seekers were ordered to disperse from the entrance near the town of Rachel at 3am on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One man even performed a naruto run in the background of a live TV report from the Area 51 event.“There’s a great sense of community among everyone here,” said John\u0026nbspDerryberry, who drove with his girlfriend, Sarah Shore, from Nashville, Tennessee.\u0026nbspOfficials confirmed there had been no reports of alien sightings or abductions so far.Additional reporting by Associated PressShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Andrew Buncombe reports from AustinTexas’s imposing state capitol, with its Goddess of Liberty statue reaching more than 300ft into the sky – higher even, than\u0026nbspthe one in Washington DC – has seen plenty of history.\u0026nbspIn recent years, none has been more memorable than a day in the summer of 2013 when a Democratic legislator, Wendy Davis, rose to her feet to try and block proposed restrictions on access to abortion. Her feet clad in pink running shoes, Davis spoke without pause for 11 hours. People gathered to watch as the afternoon slipped into evening, and as the cut-off deadline of midnight approached. A buzz grew in the marbled chamber, and reached across the nation.Eventually, Republicans would pass the new restrictions, but that hot June night belonged to Davis and her filibustering on behalf of women’s rights. Barack Obama tweeted from the White House: “Something special is happening in Austin tonight. #StandwithWendy.”Six years later, Davis, 56, is back in the fight, one of a huge number of Democratic women candidates looking to turn Texas blue in 2020. Of a minimum of 1,600 so-called “political elections” the party is contesting,\u0026nbspmore than half feature women.“Texas is the biggest battleground state,” says Brittany Switzer, senior brand manager with the Texas Democratic Party. “The majority of Texans are women, the majority of donors and volunteers are women. We’ve seen that in the last couple of years, women are running for office.”Texas would be a massive prize. The second largest state both in terms of geography and population, it also carries the second highest largest number of\u0026nbsppresidential electoral college votes – 38.For a century, Texas was a Democratic stronghold. But for the past four decades it has been solidly red Republican turf. The last Democrat to hold a statewide office was in the 1990s, and the party’s last presidential candidate to win here was Jimmy Carter in 1976.Democrats believe change is under way, and point to various clues. The 2018 midterms saw Democrats pick up a handful of seats in the House of Representatives, and Beto O’Rourke’s long-shot challenge to Ted Cruz in the Senate race stunned both parties. In the end, Cruz held on 51-48, but Republicans were forced to spend millions on a race they assumed they would hold with ease.This year, at least six Republicans from the House have announced they are standing down,\u0026nbspthe so-called “Texodus”. Among them is Will Hurd, the only African American Republican congressman.\u0026nbsp“There are two things happening,” said Matt Angle, a Democratic strategist and founder of the Lone Star Project, a political action committee (PAC) that funds Texas candidates. “One is the demographic changes, especially in the suburbs of places like Houston. The other is what the Republican Party has done it has pursued isive policies to hold onto power by sidelining African Americans and Latinos, rather than trying to win some of these voters.”The women running in Texas, with its mythologised swagger and self-confidence, are doing so up and down the ballot.\u0026nbspMJ Hegar, a 43-year-old air force veteran who served in Afghanistan and who last year narrowly failed in her bid to win a House seat, is trying to better O’Rourke and defeat Republican senator John Cornyn.“I’m not taking any money from corporate PACs (because I answer to Texans, not the special interests), so every goal we set really matters,” she said in a recent email to supporters.In Texas’s 26th congressional district, which includes Dallas-Fort Worth, 26-year-old immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros has received the endorsement of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that in 2018 helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to congress. Amanda Edwards, a member of Houston’s city council, is also running for the Senate and will face off in a Democratic primary involving Hegar and at least three other candidates.“It’s time for women to have a seat at the table” she says, speaking from Houston. “We have to give women an opportunity to lead.”Edwards says she is basing her campaign not on finger-pointing or playing the blame game, but on showing she can build coalitions. She says voters she speaks to\u0026nbspwant their representatives to “get to work”, even while their inidual priorities may differ.“They have seen politics played, and politics played out. They want people to get focused,” she says. “What is constant\u0026nbspis the disdain and lack of satisfaction with the status quo. I have no doubt this is a change election.”While Texas has vast concentrations of wealth, it also has massive levels of poverty.\u0026nbspUp to one in six Texans have no health insurance, the highest level in the nation. Around one in five Texan children live in poverty. A black or Hiic youngster is three times as likely to live in poverty as a white child.Gina Ortiz Jones, 38, a military veteran who served in Iraq, is running for the vast\u0026nbsp23rd\u0026nbspcongressional district, the one being vacated by Will\u0026nbspHurd, and which stretches hundreds of miles along the border with Mexico, from San Antonio to El Paso. She says it is larger than 30 US states.“Wherever I am, the number one issue is healthcare. The issue might be a little bit different, but the overarching issue is healthcare. Whether it’s the cost of prescription drugs, or you can imagine – if you’re living in one of our rural communities – it’s the challenge of just getting to a healthcare facility and them hopefully having the ability to provide the care you need.”She adds: “It’s a district where were we absolutely need to invest in infrastructure like broadband to be able to realise things like telemedicine and\u0026nbsp telepsychiatry, practices and technologies that exist but for which we lack the infrastructure.”Jennie Lou Leeder, a seventh-generation Texan whose grandfather purchased the family farm in Kerr County in 1882, is running for one of the most closely watched races, the 21st congressional district, which includes parts of Austin and is currently held by Chip Roy, an outspoken Republican. To take him on, she will first have to win the Democratic primary, which will also include Davis.In a bookshop on the edge of Austin, Leeder says she has received much support for an agenda that stresses diplomacy over border walls, and LGBT+ rights.“I have travelled through the 10 counties that make up my district. What I am hearing from people, is what I believe too,” she says. “Everyone has the right to affordable healthcare. Everyone should be able to turn on the tap and have safe, clean drinking water. Our air should be safe to breathe. Our food should\u0026nbspbe safe to eat. Everyone should be able to drive on good, safe bridges.”One of the most important races\u0026nbspwill be for the state legislature, which has long rested in Republican hands. It is crucial for a number of reasons, not least its role in drawing up new state and federal voting districts following the 2020 census. Democrats say these have long been gerrymandered in favour of Republicans. The party needs to flip nine seats to take the lower chamber.Donna Howard, a state representative from Austin, says women are stepping forward in Texas “because they are fed up with the agenda” being set for them. If there were more women elected to office, she says, more attention would be focused on issues such as healthcare and education.\u0026nbsp“After the election of Donald Trump, we saw lots of people coming out and saying ‘I have to do something’. Some of these were suburban women,” she adds. “It was galvanising for the so-called soccer moms who are offended by Trump.”Reports suggest Republican leaders in Texas have already sounded the alarm, aware of how the Democrats were in 2018 able to take back control of the House of Representatives with the votes of educated, suburban women once again being targeted by their rivals.Earlier this year, Politico said the party had massively increased fundraising goals in an attempt to hang on to seats following\u0026nbspO’Rourke’s run. The GOP’s fortunes are not helped, the party admits, by a scandal hanging over the statehouse, amid allegations the Republican speaker sought to have some of his own colleagues defeated. The accusations have been denied, but senior Republican Dan Patrick, Texas’s lieutenant governor, told a radio interviewer: “2020 is going to be a tough year, politically.”Robert Solera, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), says Democrats may be overly optimistic.People warned to stay indoors as storm Imelda brings ‘extreme’ floods Texas governor refuses to recall legislature to confront gun violenceThanks to Trump, Democrats are taking over in TexasPete Buttigieg was brave to call climate change a religious crisis“In 2018, Democrats had their best election in a generation,” he says.“But they were still not able to win any statewide seats. They were able to pick up a few House seats, and they narrowed the margins in some statewide races, but they did not win any.”He adds: “Texas is one of the fastest growing states in the country. People are moving there because have seen the benefits of Republican leadership.”Roy’s office said he was unavailable for an interview and failed to respond to written questions.Harvey Kronberg, an expert on Texas politics and founder of the bipartisan Quorum Report, says six or seven House seats currently held by Republicans are vulnerable, as is the state legislature. With the right candidate, he says, and if the party was prepared to invest big time in advertising, those 38 electoral college votes might also be up for grabs.“This election is going to be a referendum on Trump. Trump underperforms in the polls here, except among activist folks,” he says. “I don’t think he’s helped himself\u0026nbspvery much. Agriculture is hurting. Oil and gas prices are down.”He adds: “Depending on who they nominate, Texas is in play.”After Davis captured the eye of Obama when she delivered that 2013 filibuster, she used the momentum to run for governor in\u0026nbsp2014, but lost by 20 points to\u0026nbspGreg Abbott. There has even been talk of a movie, and she reportedly met with\u0026nbspSandra Bullock\u0026nbspwho had expressed an interest in portraying her.Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events“Women in Texas are no different than in other parts of the country. They want good, safe schools for their kids.\u0026nbspThey want clean air and water for their families,” says Davis.“And they want to know that their kids will have an opportunity to inherit a sustainable planet and will have an opportunity to realise their dreams.”\u0026nbspHouse of Representatives\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His new stance is even more laughable than last week’s, when he pledged to negotiate a “better” EU deal but campaign against it.Now he would put his deal to a second referendum but express no preference between that and remaining in the EU.He hasn’t a clue. He couldn’t say. It’s too hard. The Leader of the Opposition’s mind is a blank — not for the first time.He would merely “carry out whatever the people decide” . . . er, exactly as Boris Johnson would be doing NOWLabour wasn’t blocking him.Why does Corbyn, having failed to respect the first vote, imagine anyone trusts him to enact the result of a second The only certainty is that he WILL sell Leavers down the river, as The Sun predicted.Corbyn’s “Leave” deal would keep us in the EU’s customs union, handing it control of our economy while surrendering all our political influence.That’s the worst possible option. It’s not “leaving” at all. It’s Remain by another name. Corbyn is too dim to see it.His second referendum would thus be “Remain minus” vs Remain — a farce, absurdly biased and totally illegitimate.This coward, ditherer and fool could yet run the country, God help us.REMEMBER how our “broken” economy only works “for the few” Inflation is now just . per cent as pay leaps by . per cent, its fastest in  years.Everyone’s standard of living is rising.Remember Project Fear’s scares about the immediate catastrophe of voting Leave  A pack of lies.Unemployment is at a -year low, employment at an all-time high, thanks to new full-time jobs.Remember how the City would become a jobless wasteland  It is still easily the biggest global foreign exchange hub and pulling even further away from the competition.If this is how Britain shrugs off political mayhem, imagine what we will do once Brexit is done and uncertainty lts.VANESSA George’s crimes were wicked beyond belief.Some of the children she violated still suffer.

Leadership requires more than remaining within a safety net.He added: We risk being trapped in a zero sum game, which will lead to zero outcomes, which I do not want.The EU risks continuing to insist on a test that the UK cannot meet and that the UK Parliament has rejected three times.What we need now is a genuine negotiation with creative and flexible solutions from both sides.A rigid approach now – at this point – is no way to progress a deal. The responsibility sits with both sides to find a solution.Mr Barclay also said the backstop is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement because it doesnt have the consent of both communities.Responding to the remarks, an EU Commission spokeswoman said Brussels would not be drawn into a blame game with Britain.She said: Our role is to be constructive, to move forward the negotiations and to make progress so as to allow reaching the joint aim of having a deal.Eurocrats also batted away Mr Barclays suggestion that they are not ready for No Deal, insisting EU states are fully prepared.Both the Commission and No  confirmed yesterday that Britain has tabled written proposals on replacing the backstop for the first time.The UK side yesterday put forward a series of informal discussion papers containing over its ideas to revamp the border fix.The dossier covers parts of Britains aim for a three tier replacement to the backstop which would involve some checks on the island of Ireland.It includes agreeing an all-island agri-food zone, under which Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules on farming and food standards.This would be coupled by replacing alignment in other areas with alternative arrangements and agreeing a Stormont Lock for Northern Irish consent.Under the plan the whole of the UK would leave the EUs customs union and single market.Teams of officials from Brussels and Britain met yesterday and will get together again today to discuss the technical details of the proposal.The revelation came as two Labour MPs leading a cross-party group for a deal told Mr Barnier up to  of their colleagues are ready to rebel against Jeremy Corbyn.Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint were invited to Brussels by the EU chief negotiator so he could grill them on the latest parliamentary arithmetic.Some EU officials have expressed regret that they have focussed too much attention on hardline Remainers rather than moderates.Ms Flint said he had probed them on what pressure they could bring to bear on the two main parties and discussions surrounding the Benn bill.She insisted: There’s still a majority in parliament, cross-party, who would like to get a deal through.I think we better reflect the public. People want us to try and find a way through this.Mr Kinnock said the Frenchman told them he was not hung up on the language and the way in which absolute assurances are given the backstop wont be permanent.He said of his grouping: Dferent parts of the coalition are looking for dferent things but we really are now at the last roll of the dice.We made the point that the more the debate has radicalised and polarised, the closer you get to No Deal.Everybody that’s tried to reverse Brexit, to not accept anything that doesn’t pass ious purity tests, has played directly into the hands of the No Dealers.Irelands PM Leo Varadkar yesterday said the rhetoric and mood music surrounding the talks has improved and theres a lot of energy and a lot of positivity.But he warned: The dficulty is that when it comes to the substance of the issue that needs to be resolved, the gaps are still very wide.His deputy Simon Coveney, who met MPs from parliaments Brexit committee in Dublin yesterday, also warned the two sides are a long way apart.He said: “There is a signicant gap between what the British Government has been asking about in their approach, and what the EU is able to accept.Mr Coveney added that France and Finland agreeing a September  deadline for new UK plans showed the growing frustration and concern within the EU”.Asked about the ultimatum, the Commission said that every day counts and that the sooner we make progress the better.A French official said: If we dont get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October.Yesterday a report by the OECD warned Ireland is set to be the worst hit EU countrytheres No Deal - but Britain would suffer even more.The Paris-based think tank said the countrys economic growth would be cut by . per cent next year and in , compared with a % hit for the UK. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

classied, people attending Alienstock can expect EDM artists and unique art displays at the out-of-this-world gathering.Matty Roberts, the -year-old who created the Storm Area  event, joined the Alienstock team in Las Vegas after voicing concerns with the original event.The alien-themed event is inspired by the popular conspiracy theories that have captured the imaginations of thousands

celebration a blowout, including a classied lineup of music artists.British DJ Paul Oakenfold was seen spinning some tunes at Alien Research Center in Nevada.After thousands expressed interest in attending the original festival, the creator Matty Roberts decided to cancel the plans.He said that there were a lot of red flags popping up about the logistics of the event, which he made on Facebook as a joke.Roberts made the decision to cancel the original Alienstock Festival after a dispute was made over security, sanitation, medical personnel, and insurance permits.The website said: Alienstock will be moving to a safe, clean secure area in Downtown Las Vegas as an alternative.We are not interested in, nor will we tolerate any involvement in a FYREFEST ..We foresee a possible humanitarian

encouraging followers to gather at the base this weekend to see them aliens.The event strapline they cant stop us all, quickly went viral, prompting the US Air Force to issue a strongly-worded statement.When more than one million people expressed interest, the US Air Force warned curiosity seekers not to breach the gates at the military base, which it said is still used to test combat aircraft and train personnel.Despite the creator backing out, reports from the early hours of Friday morning said an estimated  people had already been gathering to raid Area .Keen alien-enthusiasts were seen wearing orange spacesuits, alien masks, and tin foil hats.A live-stream is still going ahead to help with the document the events that take place on September  when the storm area  movement will be taking place.The live-streamer continues: We will be filming what we will legally be allowed to film.Residents living in the town Rachel, Nevada, which only has around  full-time residents, expressed concerns about how the original Storm Area  event was going to work.Rachel resident Joerg Arnu, who can see the festival site from his house, said: Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time.But he added that those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against critters, snakes, and scorpions.It will get cold at night.Theyre not going to find what theyre looking for, and they are going to get angry.Bemused onlookers have taken to Twitter to show their support for Alienstock Festival. Our journalists strive for accuracy

Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is what it is fam. The dirty ****.Other messages between Rowe and Coleman included advice for Wood to be flirty in messages to the footballer, to keep him enticed and draw him in.Rowe suggested that Wood, of Cleethorpes, should play it smooth - make him want this now.She sent the player a number of provocative messages ahead of their meeting, Simon Jones, prosecuting, said.He told the jury: The picture that is really building here is how carefully managed all of this is - it is all a sting.In one message, Wood told Tyrone Coleman: Something Im hella nervous about. What other girl would be willing to do this for you  As well as it benefits all of us I know.Coleman sent a screenshot of messages between Wood and the player - discussing football training and the cost of their hotel room - to Rowe.The player previously told how he and Wood had exchanged general chit chat on social media before meeting at a hotel.He would transfer money to Wood, who would pay for the hotel room and check in before he arrived - sending him the room number in a message.On the final occasion, the player said Wood seemed nervous and was using her mobile phone, which was odd as they were only going there for one thing.All of a sudden, two guys just walked into the room, he told jurors.One of the guys said something like: Is this what you are doing . It happened so quickly. It seemed so staged.I managed to get out of the window without without thinking how high up it was.The footballer took hold of a fire escape and was able to run down to a car park before fleeing into a nearby restaurant, where he took shelter until police arrived.His designer tracksuit and Rolex watch, which he had taken off in the room, were missing when officers went to it.Rowe was found to be wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested days later, awaiting a flight to Dubai.The watch was on the wrist of Ras Robinson, , who was charged with handling stolen goods.After leaving the hotel, the footballer received a message from Woods phone, stating that he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and telling him to contact a number.I dont really want to expose you to the media butyou dont respond within  hours then you leave me no choice, it said.When asked about the message, the footballer told jurors: Obviously it is blackmail.Thats what they wanted to do - to get footage of me and take it to the papers.Wood, who has admitted conspiracy to blackmail, said she took part in the plot after discovering that the footballer had a partner.She said: I had previously asked himhe did have a partner and he would always shrug it off and say why was I askinghe was single, she said.I wanted his girlfriend to know that he had been cheating because it is not fair, its not right.She claimed the plan was for the footballer to be filmed in bed with her, then confronted by Rowe and Coleman, who would ask him for money.He was kissing me, he started to take his boxers down, Wood told the court.The key in the door went and Prince and Nathan came in the room.She said it did not go to plan as the footballer jumped out of the window before Rowe and Coleman could speak to him.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of thefts relating to the Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Prince Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch.The trial will continue on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"labour brexit referendum campaign plan","story":"NewsLabour may decide how to campaign on Brexit months after election, draft plan saysJeremy Corbyn has previously been criticised for saying he would remain neutralShareByNicola BartlettPolitical CorrespondentDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Jeremy Corbyn asked the partyaposs ruling NEC to back a statement which committed a Labour government to get Brexit sorted one way or another within six months of coming to power.This would include thrashing out a new deal with the EU in three months and putting it back to the people in a referendum with an option to remain within six. The party would then decide how to campaign in that referendum in a one-day special conference.It says Labour will deliver whichever decision is made by the people of Britain.Sources said the statement was put to a meeting of Labour’s ruling NEC but not yet agreed.    There was not time for a vote by the NEC today because there was too much disagreement, sources said. Instead NEC members will now submit amendments to the statement for further consideration on Sunday or Monday. Pro-EU factions will now attempt to push the leader into an explicit pro-Remain stance, rather than waiting until after an election. “It’s not a done deal - it’s still being discussed,” a source said. A source said the statement was submitted by Jeremy Corbyn himself.  “It’s Jeremy trying to develop a position that is essentially a Remain position and keeps Leave supporters and voters on board,” they said. Labour MP Lloyd Russell Moyle who backs Jeremy Corbyn but opposes Brexit criticised the proposal.He said on Twitter : Why would the NEC call for a special conference on Brexit when we have the actual confence this week.We can not support kicking the can down the road longer, we are at the clf edge.

My son is  years of age, and is not as yet ready to begin the lelong routine and responsibility of shaving.  We don’t believe that a school should enforce such policies on children between the ages of - or even  years of age. Katherine says the school insists being clean shaven is in the guidelines and unorm policy which Tollbar Multi-Academy Trust, which runs Somercotes, has confirmed. But she also says she has been told that being unshaven is “scruffy” and clean shaven is “smart”.  She said: “I absolutely disagree. I don’t believe that teachers should be going around schools targeting and approaching students to tell them they need to go home and start shaving. “It is a very personal choice and a very inidual characteristic, purely governed by how late or early any child reaches puberty.

He said: “I was surprised, it was pretty weird that they were telling me to shave. Some of my friends shave and they have sore faces and it looks horrible.”  In the unorm and appearance rules parents and pupils are given a list of what is “NOT allowed at all in an academy”. One is: “Beards of moustaches, or sideburns below the earlobes”. A spokesperson for the school said it has a “very clear dress and appearance policy” and exceptions were only made on religious grounds. The Trust said it was entitled to set its own standards and they were not breaking any rules or breaching pupils’ human rights. It also said all parents signed an agreement to comply with the school’s policies.  Speaking to BBC Look North, Katherine said: “Oliver was asked to go home and shave what they class as a beard, he has a beard. Initially they wanted to isolate him at any break or lunchtime and he wasn’t allowed to represent the school. “We’ve pushed forward and he’s allowed to attend freely at school, just like any other pupil, until we can resolve the issue. “He’s still a child. He’s a young -year-old and why should he have to begin the adult part of le which is shaving.

Rebecca Patterson, from Rushclfe, was only recently engaged when she was diagnosed with tongue cancer in April . For around eight years, Rebecca had a sore spot on her tongue and a white patch in her mouth which never went away. Rebecca, a learning support assistant, was initially diagnosed with oral thrush but she was in so much pain she could barely speak or eat.She then had a biopsy and received the devastating call from a nurse, reports NottinghamshireLive.   Rebecca said: “You can never prepare yourself for hearing the words ‘it’s cancer.’ I sat in the consultant’s room trying to process what was happening thinking am I going to die  Will I lose my tongue  How will le ever be normal again  My world had shattered into a million pieces. I remember saying to the consultant: ‘I can’t have cancer, my le with my fiancé is just beginning.’  I wanted answers to all these questions but didn’t want to hear them. I felt so overwhelmed with dferent emotions. I also kept flitting between feeling physically sick with worry - to relief that I finally had a concrete answer.” After the diagnosis, Rebecca underwent  and a half hours of surgery at the Queenaposs Medical Cente in Nottingham. Surgeons removed the right side of her tongue and then took the skin and an artery from her left arm to build her a new tongue. The team of doctors also removed the right lymph nodes in her neck and two back teeth so the tongue would fit. Rebecca added: “I woke to find my arm bandaged, two drains coming out of my neck, a tracheostomy and a feeding tube.    Whilst recovering in hospital, I went through a lot of ups and downs. I couldn’t speak for a week and could only communicate through writing everything down. My trachea would leak, and I would end up with crusty secretions around my neck, my arm was like a dead weight and I had very restricted movement in my neck. I couldn’t do anything independently and relied on the nurses to wash, dress and move me. I felt trapped inside my own body. My self-esteem was at an all-time low.” Rebecca said she struggled to get back to normal when she was discharged from hospital. She said: “Meal times were hard because I had to eat pureed food, I was breathless, I couldn’t shower easily because of my scars and I needed help to go to the toilet. I wanted to feel like ‘me’ again.” Rebecca is speaking out about coming to terms with le post surgery saying: The cancer ing was always at the forefront of my mind - it was my biggest fear.

The Camelot theme park in Lancashire was based on the well-known medieval Camelot castle, which was associated with the legendary King Arthur, and comprised of a acre site near the village of Charnock Richard. Thousands of families would visit the park each year, before its gates finally closed in . Since then, the park has been left to crumble away - now laying in tatters, with rusting rollercoasters and a crumbling white castle at the entrance.Owners Knights Leisure blamed low visitor numbers on bad weather and events such as the  Olympics and The Queen’s Jubilee - with over  staff losing their jobs.  Whilst certain rollercoasters were sold to theme parks around Europe, seven years later, many of the rides remain abandoned, reports the Liverpool Echo .‘Urban explorers’, while warned off the site, are regularly found walking the tracks of the decaying rollercoasters, avoiding the   security that roam the perimeter. Previously, almost  new homes are planned for the former Camelot site by developer Story Homes. The plans are for up to  homes and an employment area, which Story Homes says could deliver about  jobs.    The proposals have proved controversial with residents in the area. The Camelot theme park opened in  and boasted a ft roller coaster called the Knitemare which spanned some  meters. It also had a log flume, a smaller size roller coaster The Twister, three large water slides and a large caterpillar roller coaster train which spanned the wholeand depth of the park running above ground and on ground level. Together Money set about calculating the hypothetical land value of eight intriguing abandoned places from around the globe, from derelict theme parks to uninhabited islands.

But that doesnapost seem to have to be a worry for Kate Middleton, who was recently spotted with her husband Prince William and her three kids on a Flybe flight to Balmoral, Scotland. The Duchess of Cambridge is in fact said to regularly ask flight attendants to spare an entire seat for her stylish clothes so they donapost get crimped as they likely would doshoved in a checked-in baggage. Describing what itaposs like to travel as a royal in the newly released Channel  documentary aposSecrets of the Royal Flightapos, royal correspondent Emily Andrews says: Obviously when we go to the airports, especially when itaposs hand luggage only, weaposre trying to cram all our toiletries into that plastic bag.  Itaposs never big enough. The royals, however, donapost have to worry when it comes to transporting luggage or not exceeding the ml liquid limit. Far from that, Andrews said she has been on a plane where Kateaposs dresses had their own seat to make sure they were kept flat. They are not going to be shoved in the hole just to be squashed by everyone aposs.  It comes just a few weeks after the Duke and Duchess were seen flying to and from Aberdeen on a budget Flybe flight. The two took the average £ flight with their three children Charlotte, George and Louis to spend the late August bank holiday with the Queen at her summer residence. Kate and Williamaposs low-cost travelling came just as Prince Harry and his we Meghan Markle were blasted for taking private jets for half of  known trips in the past year, despite them both being environmental campaigners. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who previously said they wouldnapost have more than two children to save the planet, were criticised after being seen pictured with their son Archie boarding a private jet to Nice last month.

Not only were they planning their dream honeymoon, they had also just found out they were pregnant with their first child. But their dream le turned into a nightmare following their first baby scan when Katie was given the heartbreaking news she had bladder cancer. The -year-old from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was delighted to find out she was pregnant in February last year. But after she suffered some bleeding early on in her pregnancy she was sent for an early scan.    Nothing could have prepared her and husband, Tom, for what was to follow. Katie, who owns her own cake business, said: It was very surreal. We were told they could hear a heartbeat, so we knew everything was OK with the pregnancy, which was a massive relief and we were really excited. But then we were called into another room and a senior consultant said there was something amiss with my bladder and that it was probably cancer. My mind just went blank at the beginning, I was just in shock as it was so unexpected. But then practicality just kicked in and we knew we had to get on with things.    The next step was a cystoscopy, which looks inside the bladder, and Katie and Tomaposs fears were confirmed - she did have cancer. The coupleaposs dreams of a sunshine honeymoon in Crete were over and their trip was cancelled. When she was just  weeks pregnant, Katie had to undergo surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible. To make it as safe as possible for her unborn baby, doctors used a special machine that meant she was awake throughout the hour-long operation. Thankfully, doctors managed to remove a chunk of the tumour and the baby was unharmed.    Katie said: When they told us the pregnany was fine, that was an amazing feeling. When they pulled the curtains around my bed, every nurse on the ward had stopped what they were doing to check everything was OK with the baby. Usually, treatment would have started straight away but because of Katieaposs pregnancy that wasnapost an option. So, two months before she was due, the mum-to-be had another cystoscopy, which heartbreakingly revealed there was still some tumour on her bladder. Baby Oscar was induced a week early and was a healthy, bouncing boy.    But for Katie, the battle was far from over. Just days after she and Tom ed home with their baby boy she had to go back into hospital for more surgery and to start her cancer treatment. In January this year, new mum Katie began a six week course of chemotherapy, which was pumped directly into her bladder to reduce the side effects. But she admits, that with a newborn at home, the gruelling treatment was tiring. Katie said: It was tiring and I just wanted to be with Oscar and at home but I was having to go to hospital once a week for treatment.

Stomach-churning photos show the grim reality of le inside the property in Runcorn, Cheshire. A cleaning team lted the lid on how such are cleared and described it as one of the worst cases they had ever seen. Neighbours living next door reported seeing rats jumping in the window and couldnapost even sit out in their garden out of fears over the vermin infestation, the Liverpool Echo reported Grandparents Stephen Dowd, , and Colette Dowd, , have lived next to this rat-infested home for years and say it has taken a toll on their everyday lives.  Business owners Stephen and Colette said they couldnapost let their grandchildren play outside because they feared rats were on the childrenaposs toys. They added they could not believe the scale of clutter shown to them after they saw the interior of the crumbling home. Our reporter was invited in to see the true scale of the problem by Merseyside House Clearing, who are tasked with cleaning out the mountains of rubbish found inside. The companyaposs owner,  George Mensah , said he has been tasked with gutting properties that are packed to the brim with clutter and described this example as one of the worst cases he had seen in  years.    The first thing noticed was the overwhelming smell of damp, dust and dead vermin. A number of toasters, kettles and electrical items were piled up among the sea of items, as well as decade-old magazines. A thick grime was visible on the walls, fridge and windows as the lace, white curtains had turned black on the windows. Georgeaposs first-hand footage revealed how far the stacked items stretched. A dead rat was also visible on top of the discarded fireplace.  Stephen, who has lived next to the home for  years, said he and his we had previously tried to help the owners. They have made the brave decision to buy the property in the hopes of helping to restore the home to what it used to be. The tenants have since been moved into a temporary house and are on the road to getting another home. Stephen said: “It’s been unbelievable really, we had no idea what we were living next to. We came home off holiday and saw rats running round our garden, then we got in touch with environmental health who came and left rat poison, and then we realised it must have been coming from next door.” Colette, a former member of the armed forces, added: “We didn’t know the extent of it, there was no way of knowing they were living like that. We just kept saying there’s something not right here.    “We’ve been saying you can’t believe that someone could live like that. We’re still in shock, every day you’re finding something more shocking.” During the summer’s heatwave, Stephen said the couple were unable to leave any windows or doors open, for fear of rats and flies, and had to invest in air conditioning supplies. George’s company routinely clean hoarder’s properties, but said it is “rare” you hear form neighbours and communities whose lives are affected. He said: “We are very passionate about our work and are non-judgmental towards the inidual in question. “A lot of clients and their families are embarrassed over the situation, we do a lot of work with mental health organisations, the majority of hoarders tend to be the elderly who live on their own.  “Saying that, hoarding has no preference, no conscience.” He added: “We’ve helped people who collect cigarette butts, people who collect dead cats in shoe boxes. One of the worst ones we found was someone who had a sex dungeon hidden. “You name it, we’ve seen it, everyone has a secret. George said: “Each job you take on, it’s like the person becomes part of you, you grow to love it. It’s like becoming a carer and a whole lot of people who you help you end up becoming friends with.” Stephen and Colette said they “felt sorry” for their neighbours and have called for more help to be given to hoarders. Colette said: “I think there needs to be a special helpline like they [have] for Childline, because people are desperate and they need help.

Bobbie Dixon, from Hull, claims to have killed seven of the vermin since the beginning of summer by using traps and poison.The widow told Hull Live the rats run around the gardens at the back of the houses and she has stepped in multiple times to remove rats other residents are scared to touch.She said: “I’ll be sitting outside and rats will just run across the garden – it’s unnerving for people.  “There was one dead on the grass yesterday and everyone  is scared of them so I just picked it up.

She said: “I caught the first four in traps that I laid down. But I was told by Environmental Health that I shouldn’t be using traps and I should put poison down instead. “They said other animals could get caught in the traps. I only ever put them in safe places but I started putting poison down instead.”  She has since caught another three rats with the poison she buys from the shops but she said the root of the problem is the overflowing bins near her home. They’re just overflowing with food, she said. “It’s a disgrace. You end up standing in it walking past. People in wheelchairs are having to go over that and little bains in prams, and it’s just not right. “It’s not the residents’ fault, the landlords haven’t given them big enough bins so there is just food everywhere rats can get at.” "},{"url":null,"title":"princess dianas clever trick journalists","story":"NewsPrincess Dianas clever trick to get journalists on her side - and it worked a treatIngrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, says Princess Diana was \"one of the most media savvy women in the world\"ShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video journalist-ingrid-seward-interviewed-princess-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Rather than getting her press office to call them and tell them off, she had a much more direct approach - and it worked a treat. If she ever read a story she believed was unfair or incorrect, she would reach out to the person who wrote it and invite them over to Kensington Palace for a cup of tea. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, was one of the journalists to receive the invitation shortly before the princessapos tragic death in . She went to her apartment and the two women enjoyed a girly chat Speaking to the Sun, she said: Her way of dealing with “the enemy” was to invite them into her home, flatter them and make them your supporter.    Diana was one of the most media savvy women in the world and she knew no one would be able to resist one of her invitations. She knew we would feel obliged to put her opinion acrosswe had spent some time with her. It always worked. We were all charmed by Diana and her disarming way of putting her point across. Ingrid was just one of a number of high profile journalists to receive an invite, with Piers Morgan and Jeremy Paxman having the same honour.    Ingrid believes Prince Harry should follow his motheraposs example when it comes to dealing with the media. She believes the way he has handled the privacy of his son Archie, including banning photos from the christening and not releasing the names of the godparents, is pushing the press away. Diana had a number of other clever tricks when it came to dealing with the press, and one which always worked very well when it came to getting rid of photographers. Her personal trainer Jenni Rivett told Yahooaposs The Royal Box about a fashion tactic she used when attending their gym sessions. She said: Every single session all the media were outside camped with their stepladders, and cameras and lenses and everything.  For her she just found it so incredibly, aposwhy are they so interested in me when there is more important things to worry about in the worldapos. It wasnapost her that asked for all this. I remember one of her strategies was that she was going to wear the same Virgin Active sweatshirt every single session. This meant the photos were all the same and looked dated, so were less valuable to photographers.  I thought that was very clever of her. The famous Virgin Atlantic sweatshirt, which Diana would wear three times a week to her fitness classes, last year sold for £,. The jumper fetched more than ten times its reserve when it went up for auction on Wednesday night.

They all went out to look for her and it was one of the family who actually found the body.  Obviously, itaposs beyond heartbreaking and I donapost think they will ever get over this. In a final tweet, Keeley had told of her excitement at watching rapper Aitch perform at the O Institute in Birmingham on Wednesday night. She wrote [the] only thing keeping me going is seeing aitch on wednesday, hopefully he’ll see me and we’ll get married xxx. Residents have spoken of their shock.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMemories are everywhere in the house for Sophie ter Horst. The ­polished oak floors that wounded ­British soldiers were laid out on. The lawn outside where troops dug trenches to fend off the Nazis and the rose garden at the back, where  corpses were hastily buried in unmarked graves. The horse chestnut tree in the front garden, which saved the le of one British soldier by taking the force of a mortar bomb blast – and still bears the scars. And the cellar where her mother hid her five small children from the horrors of war playing out just metres away – but from where Sophie could hear the injured soldiers’ groans and feel the force of artillery blasts as the Germans edged closer. The Old Vicarage, next to a church in the picturesque village of Oosterbeek, Holland, had been an idyllic family home.But then war broke out and the house was at the centre of one of the biggestdisasters of the Allied fightback – in which Sophie’s mother, Kate, emerged as a hero known as the Angel of Arnhem.This week, exactly  years on, veterans have been ing, welcomed with as much warmth as they were all those years ago. Sophie still remembers the events of that week vividly. Now , she still lives in the Old Vicarage. She says: “I cherish this house and feel privileged to live here. It’s where British men gave their lives to free Europe. I’ve lived with their memories all my le. I think of them all the time.” Of the , men from the st Airborne Division who took part in Operation Market Garden in September , just , would make it out again after a vicious nine-day battle. The rest were killed or taken prisoner.  The plan was for the troops to drop into the town of Arnhem and seize a key bridge on the Rhine, then cling on until an armoured column could arrive and reinforce them. But German resistance was greater than expected and the Battle of Arnhem was the most devastating clash of the war, as portrayed in Richard Attenborough’s epic  film A Bridge Too Far. As they ran out of food and ammo, and ground reinforcements failed to arrive, the remnants of the force found themselves hemmed in on the outskirts of Oosterbeek. Housewe Kate opened her house – just  metres from the front line – as a makesht first aid station. Within days it was packed with  men and she spent her days and nights offering motherly love, plus words of comfort and strength, to the injured and dying British troops who filled every room, even the attic. Sophie recalls feeling at first exhilaration at seeing British paratroopers marching down their street following four years of Nazi occupation.  She says: “We went out and took a long time hugging the soldiers. We all kissed and embraced, and we were so happy, because we were free. “My father, a resistance leader, climbed the church tower and raised a Dutch flag. We thought the war had come to an end. “That was my first memory, that collective feeling of happiness at that moment.” But the mood soon changed... Sophie says: “Mother put us in the cellar, with a nanny. She would come and go. We heard the noise and tremors of the grenades and mortars. We didn’t know what mother was having to deal with. She transmitted a sense of safety, so I never felt fear. She later told me the house was so full of injured soldiers there wasn’t space to walk. And all the time it was being bombarded.  We saw the British just once, when she brought in a shell-shocked soldier named Lionel, as she thought it might help him being with us. He sat with us on the steps. I remember the feel of his jacket and that he gave me a piece of his chocolate.” Kate, meanwhile, was earning her name as an angel, tending to the injured, often frightened, soldiers. One paratrooper is reported to have told her “You’re lovely, just like my mum” moments before he died. General Frank King, cared for by Kate after being shot in the leg, wrote: “I noticed how the whole room brightened up at her arrival and how the soldiers hung on to her every word.” As men died, they were buried in Kate’s garden. Under relentless sniper fire, the young Army doctor in charge was twice wounded. Orderlies were killed moving stretchers and some of the wounded were shot dead as they lay inside the house.  On the ninth day, the British got orders to withdraw and , escaped across the Rhine. Furious at how Oosterbeek had helped the British, the Germans ordered everyone to leave the village. Sophie remembers: “Mother took us out and put a blanket over our heads so we didn’t see the bodies of British soldiers. But a little further down the road the blanket fell off and I saw the bodies of four Germans. It affected me greatly. I pass that spot every day and every day for the rest of my le I’ve thought of them.”  After the war, Kate refused to accept she was a hero. When soldiers clubbed together for a plaque to honour her, she insisted her name be taken off. But in ,  years before her death, she accepted an honorary MBE. Sophie’s younger brother Michiel, , says: “She thought anyone would have done what she did. She would say the real angels were the ones who fell from heaven, the brave men of the Airborne Division.” After Kate, husband Jan and their children ed to the Old Vicarage in , veterans and their relatives began to turn up, to thank her. Tragedy struck in , when her oldest son Pieter was killed by a leftover anti-tank mine by the Rhine. It did not stop Kate honouring the Brits who gave their lives to liberate Holland, making the house and its beautul gardens a living monument to them. In the shade of a cedar tree at the bottom of her garden, she put a statue of Pegasus, the symbol of the British airborne forces.  Kate died in , aged , after a car hit her and Jan outside the Old Vicarage. She was thrown into her garden, dying in the same place as so many soldiers she had cared for. Jan, who broke both knees, was nursed back to health by the same doctor, named Martin, who ran the first aid post during the battle. He flew over from England as soon as he heard of the accident. Since her mother’s death, Sophie has continued to receive British veterans, some of whom have become lelong friends. They include the family of Colonel Freddie Kemp OBE, a survey officer from the st Airlanding Light Regiment who led the troops holed up around the Old Vicarage. His grandson, also named Freddie, , often stays with Sophie at her house.  Freddie said: “Grandpa got to know Kate because he ended up having to bury most of his men in her garden. He told me the house was sniped at all the time. In the end, they had one gun they used to protect the house and keep the Germans away to evacuate. “He swam across the Rhine three times, carrying injured. He became a vicar but never forgot Kate, even naming my mum after her. Our families have been close ever since.” Another visitor was Lionel, the shell-shocked soldier. Sophie says: “In  he arrived in my garden. His grandson had literally dragged him. He said he had nightmares about that cellar and refused to come back.  “I remembered his name, even though I was only five at the time. At that, he burst into tears and fell into my arms. We both cried and I took him to see the cellar again. Later, I received a letter from him. He said that from that moment on his nightmares had stopped. He thanked me for finally giving him peace.” And the gratitude of Oosterbeek has not waned. Airborne Forces flags and Union Jacks hang from houses and shops. Fashion boutiques display clothes and bags with the Pegasus symbol, while a sweet shop sells boxes of Airborne chocolates.

Anouska De Georgiou, , who went to the same school as Kate Middleton, says she was groomed by Epstein after meeting him through well-connected friends in London in the s.

Miss de Georgiou had a privileged upbringing, attending the prestigious Marlborough College. She claimed the -year-old - who was found dead in his cell last month - slowly groomed her. It wasnapost zero to  in one day, she explained. It was introduced piecemeal, along with constant emotional, financial reinforcement that this was the path, the only path.

But she felt powerless to help the other girls being abused by the tycoon.  After seeing a girl younger than herself, she said:  I wanted to say something. I was in the ocean and she was on a paddleboard or something...and I wanted to say, aposYou have to leave.apos But I didnapost.

There were no survivors. An inquest into the hikersapos deaths noted oneaposs tongue was missing, anotheraposs clothes were aposradioactiveapos and one man had bitten off his own finger. Tents were slashed from the inside and most of the bodies were found partially naked. In  years, nobody has been prosecuted and theories have ranged from yetis, missile testing, territorial indigenous tribes, storms and mass hysteria. The coroner, under the guidance of the Soviet Union, eventually attributed the mysterious deaths to aposhypothermiaapos. But now, with advances in forensic technology and compelling new insights, could this mysterious old case finally be solved for good  Together with journalists from Ruptly, a leading forensic expert, and local guides,invites you to review this ground-breaking video investigation. Decide for yourself - was it hypothermia or something far more sinister  The crime scene and the victims  Igor Dyatlov was expected to send a telegram to his sports club from the Urals no later than February  about the groups progress but no such message was received. After families became concerned for the groupaposs welfare, a rescue mission was launched with army and militsiya forces searching the area by plane and helicopter. On February  , searchers stumbled upon badly damaged tents, which had been torn down the middle from the inside. Footprints were found at the scene, though bizarrely not in complete sets. Some could have been made with bare feet.  The bodies of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko were soon found. They were shoeless and dressed only in underwear. Branches on a nearby tree were broken, suggesting one member of the group had climbed up to look out for something. Searchers later found three more bodies: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin. Finding the remaining members took more than two months. Three of the four were discovered more dressed than others. Dubinina was wearing Krivonishenkoaposs burned, torn trousers and her left foot and shin were wrapped in a torn jacket. New forensic findings show aposdefensive woundsapos  One expert delved deeper into some of the injuries found on the bodies of the hikers to establishthey could have been inflicted by a person. This video retraces the steps of the group. First it shows a number of dummies designed to aid coroners and forensic experts by demonstrating how wounds are inflicted - particularly how a certain movement could result in a certain type of injury. Eduard Tumanov, Doctor of forensics at Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, said: “The injuries described in the Dyatlov forensic medical report are identical to the ones represented here on these dummies, which gives use reason to assume that these injuries could be received in self defence.”  “Dyatlov. He has small grazes on his face, the protruding parts of his face, which allows us to suppose that they could have been caused by him falling face first in the snow. “These abrasions happened because his legs were tied together with something. They were either handcuffed or shackled, or bound with some sort of rope, because, in the cold, rope freezes up and becomes fairly solid. “There is a very interesting note in the forensic medical report: there are red-brown coloured grazes and indentations around the front, side and rear surfaces of both ankles. “It’s interesting that he has abrasions on his metacarpophalangeal joints, which are here. What does this mean  He hit his hands against something or someone. Judging by everything, there was a fight.”  aposThere was no explosion or avalancheapos Doctor Eduard Tumanov says: So they light a fire and take their clothes off to dry them, at which point something or someone terries them and they start to climb up the cedar tree, because they have injuries consistent with climbing up a tree trunk. Straight away we can rule out death by avalanche, explosion, we can rule out chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, electromagnetic weapons, etc. The theory that animals attacked, bears, wolverines, etc...there are no injuries consistent with an animal attack. Judging by the chaotic nature of the injuries, iety, would suggest that there was not one single object that would have caused these injuries to everyone. In summary, one could assert that someone attacked them, someone without a firearm, or at least they didn’t use it, without a kne, or they didn’t use it, all the injuries were caused exclusively by hard, blunt objects. They were probably inflicted by a human hand. Unpacking one skieraposs chilling aposmessageapos  Former Editor-in-Chief of Russiaaposs Pravda, formerly the communist party of the Soviet Union paper, has also expressed doubt of any kind of aposmissile testingapos but he does believe the incident was apospre-plannedapos. Vladimir Sungorkin said: When one of the most mysterious characters, the most mysterious person in the group called Zolotarev got on the train, he was accompanied by a big group of students and he said ‘We are going on such an unusual hike that we’ll be renowned afterwards.’ We have no explanation for this, it’s absurd. Why would you become famous just going hiking  One could theorise that they were conducting some sort of experiments with drugs, adaptogens, performance enhancing drugs. Maybe for the military, the KGB, or cosmonauts. Maybe, having taken this medicine, unknown to us, they could lose their minds and kill each other in all these dferent ways. While this theory is speculative, it could help to make sense of the radio activity at the scene and why nothing known to medical experts showed up on the toxicology report. When askedhe thought they had been testing missiles, he said: So a rocket went off course, whataposs next  They say that there was a missile testing range here. This is absurd. What is a testing range  It is a specially-equipped site.  He continued: There are devices there, there is surveillance. Everything is cordoned off. And these mountains were climbed by five groups of tourists. It is a popular place, because the mountains are bare and beautul, and the taiga is also beautul. There were five groups of tourists there. And they all went through Ushma. On visiting the pass sixty years on he noticed some key unusual points. They climbed up the cedar. They’re all scratched up. One of them has a piece of finger they’ve bitten off in their mouth. It remained in his mouth, he bit his finger off. So he died, it’s clear he bit his finger off because he was in agony, otherwise, why  would you bite your own finger off  He died there as a result of this pain. When they analysed burns on his leg, they once thought that he fell and was burnt, but the burn did not show this. The person was either hung above the fire or they took a log from the fire and burned him on the cedar from below. Can you imagine this  It’s unusual to say the least. The missing clothing and ruling out a Mansi killing   As theories fly, there is one worth mentioning. As all of the hikers were found in barely any clothing, it is possible they could have simply succumbed to hypothermia. One symptom of this is known as aposparadoxical undressingapos, when a person is in the final stages of hypothermia they believe they are boiling and undress despite the freezing conditions. What this does not explain is why the hikers ran from their tents, down the mountain and into the trees. One theory that has haunted local people is that aposthe Mansiapos - a local indigenous tribe - could have been behind the killing. But speaking to Ruptlyaposs Russian correspondent, one Mansi guide said it couldnapost have been his people behind the shocking deaths. He said: They [the Mansi] only come here in the summer, at the end of May to hunt deer. When the snow falls, they go to the forest. Since the death of the hikers, the Mansi have nicknamed Dyatlov passaposKholat Syakhlapos or aposthe Deadly Mountainapos.

It’s sad to see people that are doing full-time jobs that are still struggling with bills.”Samantha Bruce runs the Food For Thought service in Charleston and recently helped launch the Lochee Community Larder.The service has been open for seven weeks with Sam saying they have handed out roughly  bags in that time.She said: “It’s been busy, I knew it was going to be.“We did know how much of a need there was and that was why we opened up the larder in Lochee.”Edna Molloy, , from Ardler, uses both Kirkton’s larder and the service in Lochee because she is unable to work because of epilepsy.She said both initiatives helped her cut down her £ food bill.Morgan Gray, , from Lochee, also attends both services.She said: “It’s great.

I thought we worked our socks off and thoroughly deserved the victory.”McGhee added: “After the two defeats, everyone could have felt down but the dressing-room was positive and that was a big three points for us.“We know in-house how good we are and how good players we are. We all believe in the gaffer’s philosophy and we knew it would come good but we need to kick on now.“We knew it would turn around with the quality we have in the dressing-room. We bounced back against Alloa and showed our character – I’m delighted for the boys.”McGhee found the net four times last season for Falkirk as they battled unsuccessfully against relegation from the Championship.With the Bairns, however, McGhee was expected to get forward much more, often being used as a right full-back rather than a central defender.A change in position hasn’t changed his aspirations of “chipping in with goals” throughout the rest of the campaign for the Dark Blues, though, as he targets a much loftier ambition of promotion to the top flight at Dens Park.Against Alloa, the -year-old was in the right place at the right time to turn home winger Josh McPake’s centre in the th minute, finishing inside the six-yard box to give his new side victory.He added: “It was just a bit of striker’s instinct! I saw Josh going past the full-back so I just got across their centre-half and directed it in.“I was absolutely delighted. I got a few goals last season at Falkirk but you don’t get forward as much playing centre-back as you do at right-back.“I have always chipped in with goals over the seasons and, hopefully, I can do the same this year.”Last season with Falkirk proved just how dficult a league the Championship is with the Bairns’ shocking descent to League One after a dreadful campaign.After moving back to Scottish football following a spell with Middlesbrough, McGhee admits it was tough at Falkirk as they went from promotion nearly-men to the relegation trapdoor.He said: “I have played in the league for two years now and anyone can beat anyone.“It is a lot dferent from the Premiership where the big two are going to take points off everyone. But in the Championship everyone takes points off each other. It is just the fact that who maintains the performance levels and wins more games will win the league.”He added: “Itcan set you up for a fall sometimes. It can be dficult as you can get praised too much and then you end up with a defeat.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d7776e9b37d24.50421766-e1568121136325.jpg ","title":"dundee united cant allow a bump in the road to puncture championship tilt","story":"Like many other title challengers in Scotland’s second-tier in recent years, Dundee United have now had their first of what may be a few bumps in the road this season.The Championship can be unforgiving and is often dubbed Scotland’s toughest ision.Eventual-champions in seasons in the not-so-distant past like Rangers, Hibs and St Mirren have toiled on their road back to the Premiership.Even last term’s winners Ross County had to fight off the likes of United and Inverness going into the final few matches of  .However, United must take heart that, despite a few challenges along the way, all those teams eventually prevailed.For now, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson is labelling their - defeat at Ayr United last weekend a ‘blip’.And, on the face of it right now, he is correct in that assessment as the Terrors remain top of the pile alongside the Honest Men.However, what the Terrors must be a wary of is that little blip getting bigger and bigger and, much like a little bump in a tyre, bursting.And another punctured attempt at promotion is not what United need after three failed efforts.A win over Arbroath today would jump-start their campaign.On the other hand, defeat at Tannadice could see United fall off the Championships summit and leave them chasing others.What’s dferent this time to seasons gone by is they have time and ample resources on their side.The Terrors never kicked into gear at Somerset Park last time out and maybe a change of tack is something Robbie will be considering – across all areas of the pitch.It has been much-documented that United are short at the back. With only Mark Reynolds a stick-on starter, there are big decisions to be made over the fitness of new boy Troy Brown or whether to opt for Paul Watson or midfielder Calum Butcher against the Red Lichties.Going for the latter in central defence would likely see Ian Harkes come into the midfield.And the American’s inclusion would be a welcome one, in my opinion.His impact in the derby win over Dundee was clear, not only with his goal but overall play.Up top, Louis Appere has impressed but when Nicky Clark came on at Ayr he looked lively and is a proven scorer at this level.Much to ponder as United look to remove the spoke from their wheel and get back on the title charge."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d84ef8db47184.83854957-770x564.jpg ","title":"jamie ness touch and go for dee clash in greenock","story":"Dundee are sweating over the fitness of Jamie Ness ahead of today’s trip to face Morton.The experienced midfielder is “touch and go” according to Dark Blues boss James McPake for the Championship clash at Cappielow.The -year-old former Rangers and Stoke City man picked up an ankle injury against Cove Rangers in the Betfred Cup before exacerbating that issue against Elgin City in the Challenge Cup a fortnight ago.And gaffer James admits it is still a niggling problem for Ness.“Jamie Ness is still touch and go. Again it’s a niggling thing,” he said.“It goes back to that tackle up at Cove and then the tackle the other week.“It’s a bit of bone bruising and swelling in his ankle that we’re doing our best to get rid of and get him going at it.”Despite that bad news, James was quick to make the point that the rest of his squad are available and is pleased with the options at his disposal. vw, px\"  He added: “Everybody  is fine.“There’s strength in depth, that was a big thing we needed to do.“You need that because we’ll get injuries and suspensions, loss of form and times where you might need to change the team for your opponent.“We’ve got players here that give us a good mixture. For example, Kane Hemmings sat there with Andrew Nelson last Saturday and what a luxury that is to have that quality on the bench.“It’s important and throughout the season everyone will be needed.”Gaffer James was particularly happy with namesake Josh McPake’s performance in the - win over Alloa last week and has also put any doubts over his fitness to bed.He said: “Josh McPake has trained and he’s fine.“He was good against Alloa, we knew bringing him to the club what qualities he had.“I’ve seen a lot of him over the years, mainly because he pops into my head quickly because he has the same surname.“You take an interest in him but he was great, very direct and had loads of attempts on goal.“The front three, in particular, were really good in the first half of that game.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is sad to see yet another Mid Argyll community organisation fold due to a lack of suitable volunteers.We seem to be so obsessed with staring at our own reflections on mobile phones these days that we are losing sight of the real world.Look around many community groups and you will notice that there are very few volunteers without the odd grey hair.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future.

Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world. Again in May, in more than  countries, millions of pupils took to the streets to remind the world that the earth faces a climate emergency.The strike starting on September  coincides with the UN Climate Action Summit in New York.

The roof over this extension will be a green roof.ldquoThe proposal seeks to restore this category A listed building, rehabilitating it as a contemporary three-bedroom dwelling.ldquoOverall, the proposed architectural moves retain the external appearance and the local identity of the buildings and their surroundings while reconstructing existing dilapidated outbuildings.ldquoThe alterations respect the character, materials and scale of the existing fabric and enable it to meet st century standards for contemporary family living by replacing all windows and doors and including new internal wall linings throughout the lodge and outbuildings where materials and internal finishes have been carefully considered and selected to enhance its historical features."},{"url":null,"title":"council-bit-environment","story":"BORDERS Council officials hope to join a new environment consultation.On September th, Scottish Government revealed it wants the public sector to spearhead efforts to combat carbon emissions in Scotland.We asked the Scottish Border Council what its plans for meeting government standards were and how they planned to go about achieving them.A spokesperson for the council told us: \"It is proposed that a first action for the Sustainable Development Group would be to review the recent decisions and actions of the UK and Scottish Governments and UK local authorities with a view to making recommendations as to how the council can play lsquoour partrsquo in tackling climate change.\"We will review the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to achieve net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by  at the latest, consider how to respond to this objective, and, specically, any Scottish Borders targets and actions to which the Council should commit to.\"We have already carried out a number of positive projects including: installation of electric vehicle charge points and development of our electric vehicle fleet, delivering local home energy efficiency programmes supporting home insulation and launch of the Affordable Warmth and Energy Efficiency Strategy and local habitat enhancement projects.\"In  multiple city councils announced climate emergencies and were followed by UK governments soon after.Roseanna Cunningham, Climate Change Secretary for Scottish Government said: ldquoSeveral public bodies, including the City of Edinburgh Council, have already made firm commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

I would not want to send my children through that woods lit or unlit at night and would not want to go there alone as a single person in this day and age.During the meeting, an agent for developer Cala said they could only build a footpath to the northernedge of the site where it meets land owned by Muirfield Grove residents.He said: ldquoResidents of Muirfield Grove have refused to engage with us to allow us to usethe site.ldquoIt is up to East Lothian Council to use statutory powers to developa path.However, Mr Findlay asked: ldquoAre we really in the business of enforcing residents to give up the right to their own land Martin White, from Gullane Area Community Council, urged councillors to invite the developer to take another look at the access paths from the hew housing.He said: ldquoNo path that goes by a wood, evenit is lit, is a safe path to school.ldquoWe believe the plans need more work to be done on them it is not that thorough, it is not ready and it needs to be sent back.However, Councillor Lachlan Bruce said he did not believe the path posed a danger to children.He said: ldquoI do not understand why walking by the wood would be dangerous. I walked through woods to primary school.The committee approved the conditions with an added condition which called for the developer to produce details of a footpath link to the south of the strip of land owned by Muirfield Grove residents for approval before building begins.It also added an additional condition asking for a Construction Method Statement to be submitted prior to work beginning amid concerns about access to the site which is through a narrow C-class road and reports of heavy construction vehicles parking off site.A third additional condition, addressing the local authorityrsquos recent pledge to take action against a climate emergency, called for a report on actions taken to reduce carbon emissions on the site to be submitted.Following the meeting, Councillor Findlay, who was the sole member to vote against approving the plans, said: ldquoIam very disappointed with the decision of the planning committee in approving Calarsquos application for detailed planning permission for Saltcoats Field despite the fact that, in my opinion, it falls far short of fulfilling Policy T of the Local Development Plan  in terms of connectivity to the rest of the

cycle routes either go over land owned by Gullane residents who have not given their permission to use or via the much longer route through Millennium Wood which is not a safe route to school or for use in low light or nighttime conditions.ldquoIt seems that, once again, members of the planning committee have ignored the wishes of the local community, the community council and their own planning

These rough arenas offered respite from a grimy and perilous working week and the echoes of precious hours spent in them can defer the thickening mists of dementia.The football players and the clubs whose colours they wore carried the pride of entire working class communities: no one owned them on these terraces and the princes and magicians they came to watch were neighbours or the sons of neighbours.Few of these grounds now exist in their original state and even fewer that are as old as Cltonhill. Albion Rovers have existed since , the last  of this stretch in this place. A collection of black and white photographs taken of Cltonhill and the supporters who bring it to le every two weeks forms the centrepiece of an exhibition at Coatbridgersquos splendid Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Le to mark Albion Roversrsquo residency at the stadium.A Game of Two Halves features the mesmeric and evocative work of the award-winning photographer, Iain McLean who was reared on the streets that surround this little park and who re-discovered his childhood love for the club while making them. McLean uses the shting light of grey skies to capture the simple act of attending a football match and to make them seem timeless. Some of these images could have been taken  or  years ago and capture the enduring simplicity of footballrsquos appeal. His pictures are accompanied by a short film by the documentary-maker Wilma Smith, who spent an afternoon recording the ebb and flow of a game through the terracing shouts of the supporters.Albion Rovers is a club whose name suggests inclusivity and where all that is tribal must depart. Other clubs across the UK have lsquoAlbionrsquo or lsquoRoversrsquo attached to their place-names but none have both together. Nor is there any such thing as a lsquoWanderers Unitedrsquo and so Albion Rovers is something unique in British senior football: its name is not narrowed by geographical boundary or city limits, yet few other clubs are embedded in the community that formed them more than this one.Every picture in McLeanrsquos Cltonhill portfolio tells a story that built this year towards something unforeseen and operatic. Towards the end of season   Albion Roversrsquo faced the biggest existential threat of its -year existence as it performed a danse macabre for its tormented supporters with the spectre of relegation from League Two. It escaped this fate with the assistance of a benign intervention as the careless whish of an administratorrsquos pen and the improper registration of an opposition player bequeathed the club three unlikely points and an advantage that was to prove priceless.Ronnie Boyd who, until recently, was Albion Rovers chairman recalls this uncertainty with a chill. ldquoItrsquos vital for Coatbridge that Albion Rovers retains its senior status. If we had dropped down into the leagues below it wouldnrsquot have been the end of us but it would have dealt a serious blow to our confidence and to the sense of pride that the community retains for this club.Rovers attract a mere  or so supporters at home games and keeping the lights on and the wolves from the door is a week-to-week challenge. ldquoThe club is run on a firm financial footing, says Boyd ldquobut nor are we carrying any padding. We are never more than something like a floodlight failure away from a financial crisis and must rely on the services of a team of volunteers who donate several hours each week to the cause of keeping this club afloat and among Scotlandrsquos senior leagues. Them and our sponsors who also go above and beyond.ldquoMany people in Coatbridge refer to us as their lsquosecond clubrsquo which causes some angst amongst the board. The eternal challenge, I suppose, is to persuade some of them to make us their lsquofirstrsquo club. I donrsquot really resent this. There are many competing attractions and lots of other small clubs find themselves in our position. Yet, the task the club faces in this is much more daunting than most other small, community clubs which strive for the right to co-exist with giants. Four Scottish Premier League clubs lie within a dozen miles of Coatbridge, including the two biggest of all: Celtic and Rangers. Celtic Park lies less than nine miles away and each week coachloads of its supporters leave the town which is still steeped in its Irish Catholic heritage.Occasionally, when a sparsely-populated terrace is captured on camera a wise-cracking, metropolitan commentator will smirk about naming the crowd as well as the teams. There are  season-ticket holders at Cltonhill and Ronnie Boyd reckons he could probably name them all. Part of this is also due to the fact that Coatbridge possesses family roots that run through several generations and that this is one of those neighbourhoods where no one can remain a stranger for long. But itrsquos also due to this being one of the few senior football grounds where the chairman and his board are often to be seen personally greeting supporters at the entrance and thanking them for their continued support at a time when the directors of other clubs are obsequiously dispensing sauvignon to small tycoons.Along the M, meanwhile, Rangers, who were put into liquidation in  for over-reaching itself faced criticism from its own supporters for charging stf prices for their games in the Europa League. Celtic, the richest sporting organisation in Scotland, couldnrsquot bring itself to pay its lowest-paid workers the National Living Wage and when it was shamed into doing so the directors first removed the annual staff bonuses. Yet here is Albion Rovers, their poorest and most humble cousins treating its own few supporters like royalty. This seems to be appreciated and theythe love with interest. One of Iain MacLeanrsquos most vivid images is of volunteers fighting a losing battle trying to sweep mounds of snow from Cltonhillrsquos playing surface for a Scottish Cup tie against St Johnstone in January last year.McLean said: ldquoWhen the St Johnstone fans turned up and realised there was a risk to the game they got on the pitch with the rest of us to clear the snow. The spirit of this place is infectious and gets under your finger-nails. In my recent experience any who turn up here for the first time are captivated and form a deep attachment to Albion Rovers and to Cltonhill.Another is taken during a particularly dispiriting - home defeat to Peterhead last year. On the condensation of a Perspex home dugout a supporter has written in perfect mirror text ldquoSCORE PLEASE, a polite request which where might have been a profane demand.At the start of this season Bury FC, twice winners of Englandrsquos FA Cup and a founder member of the English football league shut its doors after  years of existence. The faces of three generations of its supporters were crumpled in grief as they began to realise that the pride of their northern, working class community was being thrown out of a league they had helped form. Not far away from Bury is Bolton Wanderers, the club of mighty Nat Lofthouse, the Lion of Vienna and which remains locked in a mortal struggle for its own existence. Financial analysts have predicted that several other English Football clubs are just one more breached overdraft away from perdition. These clubs are also hemmed in by an assortment of the richest football teams in Europe but not a scrap from the tables of these most egregiously capitalist enterprises is permitted to nourish its distressed old neighbours. Albion Rovers meanwhile is kept alive by the endeavours by a small volunteer corps of fans and directors who provide graft and services for free. The stadium sponsor is local firm Reigart Demolition and a flotilla of other sponsors gathers each season to ensure that the bills are paid and the part-time players and coaching staff receive some form of remuneration.Albion Rovers may now be eking out a twilight existence but without dreams football is reduced and this old club still retains some of its own. In  they reached the Scottish Cup final before being defeated by Kilmarnock in a - classic in front of , spectators at Hampden. Cltonhillrsquos record attendance of , against Rangers in  will stand for all time.This was where Jock Stein, the greatest club manager in Britain, played for a few years in the early s. In the last few years the club has established a Hall of Fame that now has seven members, including Tony Green who left Coatbridge in  to join Blackpool for pound,. Green also adorns Blackpoolrsquos Hall of Fame as well as Newcastle Unitedrsquos.More recently, in the mid-s Bernie Slaven left to join Middlesbrough where he too became a household name. Despite scoring more than  goals for Albion Rovers all the top Scottish clubs disdained him for his humble surroundings and were subsequently made to look foolish.Turning up occasional pearls such as these and selling them on to larger Scottish and English outfits traditionally provided sustenance to prudently-run smaller clubs. Now, the big clubs have lsquoacademiesrsquo which they use like footballrsquos equivalent of a scallop dredger, trawling the old feeding grounds and sparking dreams in hundreds of working class households before tossing the overwhelming majority overboard in the years to come in the worldrsquos most ruthless pruning exercise. By then, many are ruined by the brief excess of their associations with the big clubs, a time during which they could have developed better habits at clubs like Albion Rovers.Ronnie Boyd says the current board of directors are determined to ensure that they never again risk being demoted to the lower leagues and is hoping that the exhibition at the Summerlee Museum will renew local interest. Next weekend, between September  and September , the museum will host a Celebrate Albion Rovers weekend to commemorate  years of the club at Cltonhill. This stadium was also the home of speedway and greyhound racing, those other two great pastimes of the British working man and these will be celebrated with classic films and an exhibition of memorabilia from those blue remembered days.The silence of an empty football stadium at repose, even one as gnarly as Cltonhill, is like a cathedral. For a football-mad supporter like me, who would have given everything to have played just one half of a game at this level, these places are mesmerising.Ronnie Boyd still has the keys to Cltonhill and, sensing my expectation, invites me for a guided tour of the old ground. After unlocking the front gates he leads me up into the dressing-rooms and through the warren of rooms and passages that lead out to the main stand and the pitch below. The hospitality area is all tombola-stall decent and the wooden seats in the stand are still shiny in the new seasonrsquos red, yellow and black paint. Only one terrace is in use but the club has resisted the urge to pull down the other two which have long since been rendered obsolete by health and safety regulations. Thus, they remain largely as they were: monuments to old heroes and immortal deeds and still capable of stirring some echoes even as the light begins to fade in old eyes.A Game of  Halvesis running until October .

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10438314.jpg?type=article-full","title":"full-list-climate-strikes-taking-place-across-scotland","story":"It is part of a global movement, inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunbergrsquos school strikes outside the Swedish parliament, calling on politicians and business leaders to take urgent action to curb greenhouse gas emissions.:Demand for post-Brexit environment protection laws as Scots show support in pollThe latest strikes come ahead of a climate action summit in New York convened by UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres to urge countries to up their climate efforts.Fridays front page of The Herald#tomorrowspaperstoday#scotpapers pic jmDmEZMNfThe UK Student Climate Networksays more than  events are taking place across the UK, with ndash for the first time ndash adults being encouraged to join the youngsters as they strike.Global Climate Strike -th of September: events in  countries on all continents.And counting...Everyone is welcome.Everyone is needed.Find your closest strike or register your own at https:t.co ikOafwrNSkSpread the word!#FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike pic ekrmeUxUKSCN is calling on politicians to bring in a ldquoGreen New Deal to cut the UKrsquos emissions to zero and improve lives, changes to education to equip youngsters to deal with the climate crisis and votes at  to give them a voice.These are the climate strikes that we are aware of so far.ABERDEEENam Marischal CollegeABOYNEam Aboyne GreenAVIEMORE:am The HubCRIEFFam James SquareDUNDEEam City SquareEDINBURGHam Middle Meadow WalkELGINam Council OfficeFORRESam Tolbooth  St Leonards Church, High StFORT WILLIAM.am Cameron SquareGLASGOWam Kelvingrove Park BridgeGLASGOWChildrenrsquos Assemblypm ndash pm Glasgow City ChambersINVERNESS:am Falcon SquareIONAam Baile Mor Village CentreKIRKCUDBRIGHT:am Harbour SquareLIVINGSTONam Civic SquareLOCHGILPHEADam Front GreenNAIRNam Highland Council officesOBAN:am Station SquarePERTH:am Bike StationSHETLANDpm Market Cross, LerwickSKELMORIEam Toward ViewST ANDREWSam St Salvatorrsquos QuadSTIRLINGam Pitt TerraceULLAPOOL:am Ullapool Primary School"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-loyalist-band-refuses-withdraw-marches-council-regret-disruption","story":"The Pride of Govan Flute Bands event, which is set to attract up to  marchers, will go ahead despite council officials asking organisers to call the parade off.The march is one of four loyalist parades taking place throughout the city on Saturday, which will go ahead after an announcement by the council that a public processions committee would not take place.Bosses at the council now say, in thecase ofthe Pride of Govan Flute Band, this is because police warned there could be serious disorderthe procession is prevented.:Four loyalist marches get Glasgow City Council go-ahead this weekendHowever, the force also said they would be able to police it either way.Last week, a decision was taken to prohibit all parades through the city over the weekend, with six loyalist and republicans events not held.However, loyalist and protestant groups gathered for a protest at George Square, claiming the move was illegal.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council has now said they were put in an impossible position.He added: \"The council has been placed in an impossible position in relation to the parade in Govan.ldquoPoliceScotlandhas said that, should the procession not go ahead, many of the  people due to take part will react angrily - which could lead to violence and a signicant impact on the local community.ldquoWe deeply regret that the wider community in Govan will be subject to this disruption.

Ana Botin was formerly in charge of Santander UK, while Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia was chief executive of Virgin Money before it was sold to CYBG last year.However, Ms Rose is the only woman so far to lead one of the UKs four biggest banks, which are RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC.Ms Rose does acknowledge the seismic change that will be sent out after becoming the first female head of a major high street bank in the UK.For her, it sends out the best possible message to the , extra women she wants to help set up their own business by .Currently, just one in three entrepreneurs is female, while in some other European countries the rate is more than  per cent.It is a situation that she is desperate to change and hopes her report will lead to a dramatic increase in female businesswomen.She said: ldquoThe scale of the ambition is considerable and in my view we now have our North Star to aim for, a % increase in female entrepreneurs.ldquoThat will act as a guide to joined up action across public and private sector.Women make up more than half the population in Britain, but just one in five businesses is female-run, a figure recently described as ldquoshocking by Robert Jenrick, exchequer secretary to the Treasury.With Ms Rosersquos encouragement, RBS has created a network of  NatWest Entrepreneur Accelerator hubs around the country.These are where would-be entrepreneurs can get help with the nuts and bolts of finding start-up funds and writing business plans from a team of women advisers.She said: ldquoItrsquos a big responsibility but itrsquos something I feel passionately about ldquoThe most important thing to remember is that itrsquos never perfect.ldquoEven when yoursquove got support and yoursquore very organised, things always go wrong. It is a juggling, balancing and complicated act.She joined National Westminster Bank as a trainee in  after graduating from Durham University.By the time RBS took over NatWest in , Ms Rose was working her way through a series of jobs in the investment banking ision, which ultimately put her in charge of leveraged finance in the UK and Europe.She helped restructure the balance sheet in the aftermath of the financial implosion and in  took over commercial and private banking, which now accounts for nearly half of assets at the group.She refuses to be drawn on the bankrsquos major challenges in the coming months, particularly with Brexit.The bank has already relocated some jobs to Amsterdam in case of a no-deal exit.Ms Rose admits that while RBS has restored some of its badly tarnished reputation there is still some way to go.She said: ldquoItrsquos been a very dficult time but we are working hard to restore it by trying to improve things for customers. I believe we have made a lot of progress in improving things, but we are not complacent.And it seems she sees it as her responsibility to inspire others too.One major area that needs to be addressed, according to Ms Rose, is getting girls exposed to female entrepreneurs and get them interested in Stem subjects which offer the highest growth for businesses.Ms Rose said: ldquoThere are not enough women in high-growth fields and that is also holding many back.ldquoBy going into schools then we can provide young girls with a role model they need to aspire too. By the time they get to college it is normally too late.ldquoThere are real and practical steps that can and will be taken. Maintaining the status quo is not an option."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-confirms-yes-vote-independence-reversed","story":"The First Minister said she thought such an outcome was unlikely, but acknowledged democracy meant people would be entitled to cancel a Yes vote though another referendum.The previously unreported comments, made in Berlin on Wednesday, are likely to fuel calls for a confirmatory vote being made a precondition of holding Indyref.They also suggest the aftermath of any Yes vote could be as politically turbulent as the one following Brexit, as Unionists could try to have the result overturned.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoAs soon as you say a referendum result is irreversible, by definition itrsquos not democratic.\"Becausepeople change their mind, orcircumstances change, thentheyrsquore not allowed to change the decision, then itrsquos not democratic.Asked directlya vote for independence could be reversed by a later vote for the Union, she accepted it was a possibility, adding: ldquoItrsquos up to people to decide the future they want.The Scottish LibDems and Tories said it was a recipe for endless ldquochaos.Ms Sturgeon has said she wants another vote on the constitution next year, but the UK Tory Government has so far refused to grant Holyrood the necessary powers to hold it.Labour has said it is open to a second referendum, provided Nationalist parties win a fresh and unambiguous mandate, with some Labour MPs also pushing for a confirmatory vote on the outcome of independence negotiations between Edinburgh and London.Ms Sturgeonrsquos remarks are fully consistent with her desire to revisit the No result of the  referendum and the Brexit result of the  referendum.However they will dismay parts of the Yes movement, including some SNP MPs, who warned her not to set a precedent by backing a second Brexit referendum in case it opened the door to Unionist challenges to independence.The SNP Governmentrsquos  White Paper on Independence was silent on the possibility of a further referendum, declaring that independence would follow  months of negotiations.Senior SNP politicians also try to avoid hypothetical questions about a Yes vote possibly being overturned.But Ms Sturgeon, in Germany to meet politicians and business leaders and receive a media prize for being a ldquovoice of reason on Brexit, was unable to escape her own logic on the issue.At a press conference at the German Council on Foreign Relations, she was asked by a Czech news agency reporterthere would be a third independence referendumshe lost Indyref.After saying she thought Scotland would back independence, she said: \"No politician can decide that a country no longer has the ability to choose its own future.

No matter what might befall Scotland and how it might be governed in future the basic human rights of its citizens, respecting their faith, sexual orientation, race and political beliefs were now deemed to be sacred. In future there might still be greed and corruption and malfeasance at the heart of public le and in the grand offices of state but the people had now been empowered by something greater than them all.The beauty of the ECHR lies not merely in the clarity and nobility of its language but in the way that no detail pertinent to the peace and happiness of the inidual is overlooked. Article  in the substantive protocols to the ECHR has this to say about education. ldquoNo person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any s which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.This protocol seemed to reinforce another great legislative testament to Scottish enlightened and progressive thinking, the  Education Act. This guaranteed the right of Scotlandrsquos Catholic population to have their children educated by the state according to the norms and mores of their faith. The Act wasnrsquot an endorsement of religious indoctrination it didnrsquot grant a licence for sectarianism. It was simply an acknowledgment of the important role that faith plays in the lives of many of its citizens. Following the harrowing experiences of the Great War it was also an acknowledgement by the state that Catholic children, ravaged by high levels of malnutrition and the effects of multi-deprivation, might be needed to fight any future existential threat to our freedoms and democracy.For more than a century now Scotlandrsquos Catholic schools have flourished and are regularly found to have excelled, under strict inspection, beyond the boundaries of their initial remit. Over several decades when the influx of Irish-Catholic refugees fleeing the Great Famine risked inflaming tensions with the indigenous Protestant working classes the existence of these schools has helped in the process of peaceful integration. They act as bridges where the old and cherished beliefs of a religious minority can meet and converse with the greater Scotland beyond. In disadvantaged neighbourhoods they continue to perform heroically and offer children in these places hope and a slender chance of a rewarding le. Scotland should be proud of them. And we Scots of Irish-Catholic stock should be proud too that we live in a country which cherishes dference and ersity and values our communityrsquos distinctive contribution to its public le.Nicola Sturgeon recognised this last year at a celebration to mark  years of Scotlandrsquos Catholic schools. She said: ldquo is the centenary of the legislation that brought Roman Catholic schools into Scotlandrsquos state education system. In that time, Catholic schools have made a tremendous contribution to Scottish education, and this is something we want to see continue. We value the contribution that Catholic schools make to modern Scotland. We want that contribution to continue in the years ahead.One year on from the First Ministerrsquos eloquent endorsement attacks on Catholic schools remain predictably depressing. The most recent follow skirmishes in Glasgow earlier this month when an Irish republican parade was confronted by protesters. Predictably, this was portrayed as another outbreak of religious sectarianism. Yet, it probably owed more to the current heightened tensions surrounding the prospect of a hard Brexit, the Irish border and inflamed British nationalism. In a remarkably ignorant and badly-written article a former deputy chief constable in Police Scotland used this isolated and rare occurrence to justy shutting Catholic schools. ldquoWe also need to look at the roots of the problem and question what ides us, he wrote. ldquoAndwe do that then we simply cannot escape questioning our system of religiously segregated education. His words were a sinister reminder of why large sections of the Irish-Catholic community traditionally beheld Scotlandrsquos police forces with deep mistrust.The independent Advisory Committee on Tackling Sectarianism set up by the Scottish Government has produced several wide-ranging and exhaustive reports. These specically and unequivocally stated that Catholic schools were not even remotely a cause of sectarianism in Scotland. It also pointed out that, in any case, sectarianism was largely in retreat in modern Scotland.So, in the absence of any evidence that Catholic schools contribute to sectarianism and in spite of counter-data that they actually foster multi-culturalism and tolerance what lies at the root of these attacks  Letrsquos speak frankly here. The people who are most vocerous in their hostility towards Catholic schools also purport to cherish ersity and equality. Yet they want these only within the bounds of a narrow and illiberal agenda. It is group-think that relies on old and discredited tropes that were once used to alienate and target minorities. These people simply donrsquot like the idea of Catholic schools but have nothing to justy their hostility. Each year they are reduced to scanning Scotlandrsquos cultural horizon looking for any little wrinkles that can be swollen into  outrage.Professor Sir Tom Devine, Scotlandrsquos foremost historian, said of this: ldquoIf there was one action certain to inflame sectarian tensions in Scotland it would be any suggestion from the Scottish lrmGovernment of an intention to abolish Catholic schools. That would rightly be regarded as an attack on the Catholic community itself.Laughably, the same people who attack Catholic schools are often to be found in the cultural vanguard that disdains Orange Parades. Of course, nice, well-dressed climate and political protests where we all stop for croissants and smoothies at some chi-chi deli are deemed acceptable. But Orange parades where the marchers, often poor, are hanging on to that pillar of their existence that lends meaning to their lives are considered beyond the pale. Not for the first time this Scot of Irish-Catholic heritage finds more common ground with the Orange Order than with the intolerant liberals who seek to ban their walks. It seems that we have a common and implacable enemy."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-confirms-yes-vote-independence-reversed","story":"The First Minister said she thought such an outcome was unlikely, but acknowledged democracy meant people would be entitled to cancel a Yes vote though another referendum.The previously unreported comments, made in Berlin on Wednesday, are likely to fuel calls for a confirmatory vote being made a precondition of holding Indyref.They also suggest the aftermath of any Yes vote could be as politically turbulent as the one following Brexit, as Unionists could try to have the result overturned.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoAs soon as you say a referendum result is irreversible, by definition itrsquos not democratic.ldquoBecausepeople change their mind, orcircumstances change, thentheyrsquore not allowed to change the decision, then itrsquos not democratic.Asked directlya vote for independence could be reversed by a later vote for the Union, she accepted it was a possibility, adding: ldquoItrsquos up to people to decide the future they want.The Scottish LibDems and Tories said it was a recipe for endless ldquochaos.:Paul Hutcheon: In indyref, the stakes would be so much higher for UnionistsMs Sturgeon has said she wants another vote on the constitution next year, but the UK Tory Government has so far refused to grant Holyrood the necessary powers to hold it.Labour has said it is open to a second referendum, provided Nationalist parties win a fresh and unambiguous mandate, with some Labour MPs also pushing for a confirmatory vote on the outcome of independence negotiations between Edinburgh and London.Ms Sturgeonrsquos remarks are fully consistent with her desire to revisit the No result of the  referendum and the Brexit result of the  referendum.However they will dismay parts of the Yes movement, including some SNP MPs, who warned her not to set a precedent by backing a second Brexit referendum in case it opened the door to Unionist challenges to independence.The SNP Governmentrsquos  White Paper on Independence was silent on the possibility of a further referendum, declaring that independence would follow  months of negotiations.Senior SNP politicians also try to avoid hypothetical questions about a Yes vote possibly being overturned.But Ms Sturgeon, in Germany to meet politicians and business leaders and receive a media prize for being a ldquovoice of reason on Brexit, was unable to escape her own logic on the issue.:Jeremy Corbyn will not allow indyref in lsquoformative yearsrsquo of Labour governmentAt a press conference at the German Council on Foreign Relations, she was asked by a Czech news agency reporterthere would be a third independence referendumshe lost Indyref.After saying she thought Scotland would back independence, she said: ldquoNo politician can decide that a country no longer has the ability to choose its own future.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Should they be abolished in a major reform of working practices that gives us more time off, wonders Stephen Jardine.The queue at the bus stop was longer than usual. And a bit grumpier. That was because the buses were on a Saturday service even though it was a Monday.If you are following this so far, well done. It is about to get really complicated. On the third Monday in September, Edinburgh has a Public Holiday. Not a Bank Holiday. In the rest of Scotland, the holiday is next Monday. Except the Borders, who take the second Monday in October. Oh, and Fe which waits until the third Monday in October.The labyrinthian web of our public and bank holidays is hard enough for mere locals to decipher. What chance have you gotyou are an overseas business trying to work out why no one answers the phones or emails in parts of Scotland on certain peculiar days These odd throwbacks to the past date from the days when mandatory closures were the only way to give rest and respite to the mass of the workers. If the banks and great institutions of Government were closed then no work could be done and nothing could happen. It really was that simple.: Four-day week: Read this and you’ll be convinced it makes sense – Angela CrawleyFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereNowadays nobody actually notices anymore. Online banking has made Bank Holidays obsolete and unless you physically need to visit a local authority office on a specic day, the closed sign will probably pass you by.School closures are the one manestation most likely to impact the general public but families will just put it down to the ongoing drama that is being a working parent when your child is going through education.And as for those who don’t work for central or local government, well it is just another working day. With economic growth forecasts downgraded under the shadow of Brexit, an enforced shutdown is the last thing most businesses need or can afford.So who benefits  On every bank and public holiday we all try to do the same things. If it is sunny, Portobello Beach is packed and the main roads are jammed with people trying to get out of town. If it is wet, we are stuck inside trying to fix wonky shelves and catch up on Game of Thrones.In the joined-up, technologically advanced society of  with business and communication happening around the world rather than just with someone down the road, is this really the best way to deliver leisure time The answer isn’t less holidays. It’s a well-known fact that we work the longest hours in Europe but still lag behind the continent when it comes to productivity. Could part of the answer be our rigid adherence to set date holidays Increasingly we are seeing companies finding creative ways to be modern employers. Last week it was reported some firms are now allowing staff to set their own wages in consultation with colleagues. Others are switching to a four-day week or nine-day fortnight in a bid to deliver the elusive work-le balance.Surely the way forward for us all is a statutory increase in the amount of holidays for every person in this land but for us to use them as and when we want. As society changes, our approach to holidays also has to alter, otherwise the past risks holding back our future.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish mnd campaigner lucy lintott reveals she is expecting baby boy","story":"Scotlands youngest MND sufferer has announced she is expecting a baby boy.Lucy Lintott, , the countrys youngest person to battle motor neurone disease is believed to be the first to fall pregnant post-diagnosis.window.twttr She made the incredible announcement on Friday afternoon on her social media accounts, sharing a picture of her and fiance Tommy Smith cradling her bump.Writing on Twitter, Ms Lintott said: “We’re delighted to announce that early next year we’ll be bringing our baby boy into the world.”Lucy was diagnosed in  with MND, aged just .Doctors told her she might have just four years to live, and she feared she might never be a we.The inspirational campaigner threw herself into fundraising for charity MND Scotland, so far raising more £, to help find a cure for the debilitating disease.It is understood that the baby is due in February, with the couple expected to exchange vows in a ceremony next year.Speaking to the Evening Times, Lucy said: “They told us there are no known cases anywhere of someone with MND becoming pregnant.\"But my womb is unaffected by MND so in theory I should have a normal pregnancy and be able to have a natural birth.\"She added: \"I see a consultant and get scanned once a month, and the doctors have said they will just have to play things by ear - just like any other mum-to-be.“If there are complications then we will deal with them - just like anyone .\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"joanna cherry vows to pull out all the stops on parliament suspension legal case","story":"The Scottish MP at the heart of the court challenge against Boris Johnson#s suspension of Parliament has said political leadersmust #pull out the stops# to get the Commons sittingthe government loses.Joanna Cherry spoke out amid claims that the UK government could effectively continue with the suspension of Parliament eventhe Supreme Court finds prorogation to have been unconstitutional in its judgement next week.The Edinburgh South West MP said “From a political perspective I do think it’s very important thatthe Supreme Court finds in our favour that all politicians pull out the stops to make sure that Parliament gets back to work as soon as possible.”The Law Society of Scotland yesterday defended the independence of the courts amid claims the case has resulted in judges effectively being dragged into the political process.“The Court of Session, High Court and Supreme Court judgments have demonstrated that the judiciary and legal profession act independently and consider cases before them in light of their legal competence, regardless of political or public opinion,” Law Society president John Mulholland and Dean of the Faculty of Advocates Gordon Jackson QC said.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair pilots call off planned strike action","story":"A series of strikes planned by Ryanair pilots have been called off.Members of the British Airline Pilots Associationwere due to walk out on Saturday and then on September , ,  and .The union is embroiled in a long-running row over a series of issues including pay and conditions which has already led to industrial action.Balpa said it had called off the strikes even though the relationship between Ryanair and its pilots in the UK and where remains \"acrimonious\".: Easyjet slammed for new Edinburgh to Birmingham route A statement said: \"Instead of engaging in negotiations Ryanair has reverted to type, electing to punish pilots by withdrawing their travel benefits.\"Despite this, UK pilot representatives consulted striking members yesterday and agreed to suspend any further strikes in order to pave the way for meaningful negotiations under the auspices of the UK conciliation service, Acas.\"Despite a strong turnout for strike action and a high level of commitment among pilots in Ryanair, the pilot representatives took the decision to allow a breathing space in the hope that constructive negotiations could get under way.\"Balpa retains the ability to set new strike dates should it be necessary.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk .

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set.

She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from.

It ought to be a resignation issue but wont, given the proximity of a general election in late Autumn or early .Amid the noise, bluster and faux outrage, there will be a sizeable number of Labour MPs privately anxious to avoid a resumption of Parliament. Why would they want to be dragged from the fun of a party conference by the Brighton seaside to hear parliamentary arguments played on a repeat loop for the last year  While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court, should it find against the Government, will determine the date Parliament should resume, the pressure for an immediate restoration would be huge. That could take a wrecking ball to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester at the end of this month.In truth, Parliament prorogued is probably as effective as Parliament sitting. MPs wasted the last year voting against all options. The Liberal Democrats have now decided that all options are off now, anyway. They will simply cancel Brexit. This from a party that supported a referendum.Any chance of a deal will owe precious little to Westminster, where posturing and pantomime had long displaced any serious consideration of the issues at stage. Instead, progress will be a product of often fractious but, of late, somewhat more measured exchanges involving the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the DUP.Arlene Fosters party made a signicant concession in accepting all-Ireland - in effect, EU - alignment in agriculture and food, butthat is the limit to the DUPs movement, there is still huge distance to travel. More than % of cross-border trade is in other sectors and the demand for the backstop remains for those aspects.There is a reasonable chance that the backstop is re-labelled as it is politically toxic - but a renaming is not a dispelling. Resolving the issues will require much more moderation and considerable fudging.Assurances might be given to the DUP that any checking of goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to, at most, token checks. A revival of Stormont could be talked up as part of a triple-lock on any EU expansion of regulations covering all-Ireland trade, involving the Westminster and Dublin parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some concessions to the technocratic approach to customs and regulations checks offered by the Alternative Arrangements Commission might be forthcoming. The sum of modest parts might be sufficient to claim victory in modying the Withdrawal Agreementor upholding all its principles .The DUP needs a win to take to its own party conference at the end of October, which, like Sinn Feins Ard Fheis three weeks later, might take on the appearance of a pre-election rally. Given the DUPs long-standing opposition to the backstop, the party needs to show how it made a substantial contribution to its modication. Bilateral discussions between Arlene Foster and the Taoiseach indicate that neither party wants to be responsible for a no-deal failure. Leo Varadkar has got most of his electorate onside in the blame game. It might be harder for Arlene Foster at an election, even allowing that the DUPs support has held up perfectly well in the three years since the EU referendum.The endgame will probably not become clear until the European Council meeting in mid-October. It may be autumn but it is neither mellow nor fruitful. Just very misty, with little sign of the fog clearing.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool.

However DUP councillor David Graham branded the decision as \"politically contrived\" and claimed it would disproportionately impact Protestant, Unionist and Loyalistcommunities. \"No one wants to see flags flying in tatters,\" he said.\"We opposed this consultation because it has been politically contrived. \"There has been clear legal advice to the council that the PUL community would be unfairly impacted due to the cultural and historical traditions within that community.\"The move, which follows months of tensions heightened by the appearance of Soldier F emblems in loyalist areas, was supported by Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.Exact details of the planned poll will be discussed at a future committee meeting and will need to be ratied by full council when it meets in October.Mr Graham said Belfast City Council\"does not have the legal remit to legislate on flags\" in the absence of a ing Assembly. \"Therefore, regardless of the outcome, BCC will not be able to implement any proposals,\" he added.\"This is another outworking of a mess created by Sinn Fein. \"They originally started by proposing a motion on banners, with the assistance of Alliance, now it has turned into a public consultation.\"The DUP has been consistently opposed to the flying of any paramilitary flags.\"The Balmoral representative was referring to a Sinn Fein motion passed in July which forced the council to take legal action against the Department for Infrastructure.The move compelled the council to remove paramilitary flags from its property including UVF banners from lamp-posts in the mixed housing development in Cantrell Close. No action was ultimately taken after the department cited fears over simmering tensions and staff safety.After seeking legal advice the council backed down and the thorny issue was back on its agenda. Alliance councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown, who proposed the latest motion, said it is not the local authoritys role to decide how communities express themselves.\"Flags are often displayed as symbols of marking territory in the community, intimidating residents and visitors, and can even impact businesses ability to trade,\" he said.\"However, a shared future does not mean a neutral, nondescript future.\" The Botanic representative said legal emblems and flags can be a safe, respectful and legitimate way to express culture which means the public must be consulted.\"It is not good enough for the council to attempt to take action on an ad hoc basis as flags go up,\" he added. Another unionist councillor who was at yesterdays meeting accused those who supported the action of engaging in a dangerous game of \"chest beating\".\"It simply wont work,\" they said. \"Self regulation is starting to produce results as it has done with bonfires and this decision only serves to undermine that progress. \"Its just another way for the council to wash its hands of the problem. \"No one wants to see paramilitary flags on our streets but this is just going to create more tension.\" The consultation is expected to take place in December or January."},{"url":null,"title":"bishop hailed as a man of vision retires","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said that as there were so many people present, he had not intended to mention iniduals. \"However, I would like to pay special tribute to Margaret Ritchie, who has been so supportive of the cathedral, and one of the things that has given me great joy is her acceptance of a peerage,\" he said.Bishop Miller added, to applause: \"I dont know what she will choose as a title, but might I suggest Baroness Margaret of St Patrick!\"One of Bishop Millers last acts in Down Cathedral was the dedication of a new brass cross, which is suspended above the communion table.Bishop Miller, originally from the Shore Road in Belfast, came to faith as a boy in Greencastle Methodist Church and later joined the Church of Ireland.

He lost his seat on the last count and Mr Manton wasnt elected.It is understood that the legal action centres on an alleged verbal agreement between the UUP veteran and his party over the conduct of the campaign.Earlier this week, Belfast High Court heard that Mr McGimpsey is to pay £, for ly referring to Derry-born Republic of Ireland player James McClean as a \"super-Provo\". His legal action against the UUP pre-dates that settlement.Mr McGimpsey has been a UUP member for  years and retains membership of the Knock and Ballyhackamore branch.He had been a councillor for almost two decades representing Court and Castlereagh Central before being elected in Lisnasharragh in .Both Mr McGimpsey and the UUP yesterday declined to comment. The veteran politician is also suing Mr Manton for libel. Mr McGimpsey alleges that his running mate defamed him on social media.Mr Manton had tweeted in response to an interview Mr McGimpsey had given prior to the count in which the councillor said he didnt know Mr Manton. \"He was in the Conservative Party and he joined us I think about a year ago so I dont really know the guy. Ive spoken to him once I think,\" Mr McGimpsey said.Mr Manton then tweeted that he wanted to \"clary\" that he had been a member of the UUP \"since January \" and he went on to make other remarks Mr McGimpsey alleges were defamatory.Mr McGimpsey is one of his partys most left-wing and liberal members. He has long been pro-choice on abortion and is a staunch animal rights supporter and critic of Belfast Zoo.Belfast High Court heard on Wednesday that the veteran UUP man will pay the compensation to James McClean in two instalments. Mr McGimpsey had already issued an unreserved apology for the remarks which he said were made \"in the heat of the moment\" in an interview with BBC Radio Ulsters Nolan Show last year.He also paid substantial damages to Sinn Fein councillor Ciaran Beattie for \" and unfounded\" Facebook comments about him last year.Mr McGimpsey and his older brother Michael rose to prominence in the mid-s when they challenged the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the Dublin courts.Speaking previously about the legal action, he said: \"The lawsuit was very much my baby.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come.

The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues.
