We didn\u0027t attack Ukraine, either.\u0027  And there were indications Lavrov didn\u0027t have the power to negotiate a cease fire.\u0027The broad narrative he conveyed to me is that they will continue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surrender,\u0027 Kuleba told reporters after his meeting with Lavrov and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey.Lavrov said Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky but it would have to be substantive and focus on specifics. And he said in reference to the hospital attack: \u0027It is not the first time we see pathetic outcries concerning the so-called atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military.\u0027He made outlandish claims that the hospital had been taken over by Ukrainian radicals and all the \u0027mothers and nurses were chased out of there\u0027.The foreign minister also accused the West of providing Ukraine with weapons.He said: \u0027We see how dangerously our Western colleagues, including in the European Union, are acting now, which, in violation of all its so-called principles and values, encourages the supply of deadly weapons to Ukraine.\u0027Meanwhile his counterpart Kuleba blasted the \u0027difficult\u0027 meeting, accusing Lavrov of bringing \u0027traditional narratives\u0027 about Ukraine to the negotiating table.He said after the failed talks: \u0027I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender.\u0027  Russia has demanded that Ukraine cease military action, change its constitution to enshrine neutrality so it cannot join the EU or NATO, recognise Crimea as sovereign Russian territory and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent territories."},{"url":null,"title":"China refusing supply Russia aircraft parts Western sanctions Moscow admits","story":"Share this article Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries tweeted that Chelsea FC will be able to operate under a \u0027special licence\u0027.The team will be able to play fixtures and pay staff, but trading in players seems to be off the table.Only \u0027existing ticket holders\u0027 will be able to attend matches.It appears that means only season ticket holder, and away fans will not be permitted. There is also the prospect that Champions League games will be played effectively behind closed doors, as those tickets are often purchased separately from season tickets.Merchandise sales are also expected to end. Ms Dorries said the aim was to ensure that Abramovich cannot \u0027benefit from his ownership of the club\u0027. Mr Abramovich is worth 10.4bn ($12.5bn), according to Forbes, and owns a £150million Kensington mansion, a £22million West London penthouse, and more than £1.2bn of yachts, private jets, helicopters and supercars based in Britain and around the world.His two superyachts may already be out of reach. £430million Solaris was moored in Barcelona a week ago but is now off the Sicily coast, believed to be heading to Israel, where he holds citizenship. The £540million Eclipse is currently in open sea off the coast of the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.In London, his staff are said to have been ready for viewings at his 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens, valued at more than £150m, and a three-storey penthouse at Chelsea Waterfront, worth an estimated £22m.Chelsea FC is his most valuable British asset, after the oligarch transformed its fortunes from outside challengers to Premier League giants with the help of Jose Mourinho and huge signings like Didier Drogba, so its sale will be a personal blow to the billionaire industrialist. The country is facing the gravest economic crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after crippling sanctions were imposed on almost its entire financial and corporate system. Many companies  - including McDonald\u0027s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and General Electric - have also hit Russia\u0027s economy by temporarily suspending business in the country.Major retailers such as Zara, H\u0026ampM, Ikea and many others have also suspended sales in Russia, closing their doors in many shopping centres in the capital Moscow. The world\u0027s top fashion houses such as Gucci, Prada, Dior and Fenti also shut from Monday.The sanctions have seen the US cut off the Russian central bank, effectively preventing Americans from doing business with it and severely limiting Russia\u0027s ability to defend its currency.The US also imposed sanctions on the state investment fund, with an official saying Joe Biden intended to ensure the Russian economy \u0027goes backward as long as Putin goes forward with his invasion of Ukraine\u0027. As of the morning of March 9, $1USD was equal to 133 Russian roubles.

Latest figures show there are 164 multi-denominational schools.Under a new deal, Catholic bishops will “co-operate fully” with the department in seeking to facilitate a more erse school patronage in eight pilot areas where there are no multi-denominational primary schools. The pilot areas are Arklow, Athlone, Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick and Youghal.The department said it will make available “independent facilitators” to work with school patrons and school authorities at a local level.They will help identify potential schools and engage with school staff and parents, with a view to agreeing on a transfer of patronage and change of ethos, where there is demand.Minister for Education Norma Foley said the learning from these pilots will inform the process in other areas of the country.“I acknowledge the significant contribution that the Catholic Church has made, and continues to make, to the Irish education system. The department and the church recognise that there is a need for further progress in terms of visible and tangible change to provide more options of multi-denominational provision for parents,” she said.The patronage of many Catholic schools that reopen as multi-denominational is likely to transfer to State-owned Education and Training Boards.It is the patron to Community National Schools, which are multi-denominational in ethos.Earlier this week, Educate Together – another multi-denominational patron – said it was seeking reassurance from the department that parents will be consulted and provided with accurate information for the reconfiguration of future schools.It said it had been excluded from the reconfiguration of a Catholic school in Nenagh, Co Tipperary, despite surveys indicating it was the patron of choice among parents."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"\u0026ldquoWindthrow is now the greatest threat to economic forestry in IrelandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus testing may be derailed due to strike action","story":"Patients in hospital with the virus increased again on Thursday to 877, up 48 on the previous day, and the highest figure since late January.

A total of 82 of these have died in this wave, since last Christmas, according to an update from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).This is by far the lowest mortality figure for any wave of the pandemic 884 care-home residents and staff died in the first wave in 2020 and 1,026 in the third wave in 2020-21.There were 44 outbreaks in nursing homes and community hospitals last week, involving 384 linked cases – 129 outbreaks among staff and 246 among residents, with nine cases of unknown status.The absence of staff as a result of infection is having an impact on acute hospitals and residential care settings, according to Health Service Executive chief clinical officer Colm Henry. The recent rise in cases was also having a “very disruptive effect” on the flow of patients through hospitals, he acknowledged.The number of patients in hospital with the virus increased again on Thursday to 877, up 48 on the previous day, and the highest figure since late January.Dr Henry described the recent rise in hospitalisations as troubling, but said that half of all coronavirus cases in hospital are incidental, in that the patients were admitted for another condition and were then diagnosed with the virus.The proportion of non-incidental cases in intensive care, which had been at 99 per cent, has fallen to 57 per cent, he added.The number of intensive care unit patients with the virus dropped to 41 on Thursday, down six on the previous day.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"emma desouza to run as independent voice in ni assembly elections","story":"Emma DeSouza: ‘I think this is an opportune moment for a new type of politics in Northern Ireland.’  Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe campaigner Emma DeSouza is to stand as an Independent candidate in the North’s Assembly elections in May.Ms DeSouza, who lives in Co Fermanagh, will run in the constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone.

Its nuclear weapons programme and missile tests make headlines but, fundamentally, it is a “Hermit Kingdom” cut off from the outside world. Even its Chinese allies are viewed with deep suspicion. Yet the Kim dynasty’s rule there has lasted since 1948.Russia may soon be about to experience the same fate. If the Western alliance wants to isolate Russia as severely as North Korea, we could inadvertently grant Vladimir Putin and his chosen successor decades of tenure in the Kremlin. Squeeze Putin until the pips squeak is an understandable reaction to the Russian invasion, but is it wise? The question is whether cutting Russia off from other sectors, such as media, would in fact benefit the Kremlin\u0027s information operation. North Korea cracks down on “spiritual pollution” with  gusto. A recent Russian visitor to the country told me how shocking the lack of private cynicism of Kim\u0027s regime there was. Whereas ordinary Soviet citizens sneered at the Party line in the 1980s, almost complete isolation from outside contacts has enabled Pyongyang to fill people’s minds with the official version of events. Kim Jong Un is safe so long as North Korea is isolated from the West. Vladimir Putin may well think he can stay in the Kremlin so long as the West targets young Russians as cultural pariahs. We may think that depriving them of contact with the wider world – and cancelling everything from Tchaikovsky to Russian Netflix – will provoke a popular uprising in Moscow, but that does not account for the fact that neither North Koreans nor Cubans have not risen en masse on the back of decades of stringent sanctions.History suggests that the killer for totalitarian regimes is in fact the relaxation of tensions. These autocrats need an enemy.Anyone who can remember how, for instance, the Reagan-Thatcher détente with Gorbachev led to much more contact between East and West can see how that did to erode Soviet communism. Even before that, participation in the Moscow Olympics in 1980 by Western spectators as much as athletes opened Russian eyes to the gap in lifestyles between “us and them”. Simple consumer gadgets like the Sony Walkman cassette player caused crowds to gather in admiration.Russian nationalists who regard Putin as “wet” on Western influence are delighted by every fast food restaurant shut and every Spotify subscription blocked by sanctions. President Biden and the EU  are closing Russia’s windows on the West far mote effectively than ever the Tsars’ censors or Soviet goons could.A generation of Russians whose minds lived in a Western-dominated cyber-space have been spurned by us. There is no guarantee that they will blame the Kremlin, rather than us, for that fact. An isolated Russia might well become North Korea on steroids, with the largest nuclear arsenal in the world.

Shadow Defence Minister Luke Pollard said: “Conservative ministers have cut the British Army to its smallest size in  years, with frontline troops bearing the brunt of these cuts. Our Armed Forces are essential to our national security and resilience. “With growing Russian aggression, the Government is pushing ahead with further cuts to the Army by , troops over the next three years. “Ministers must halt these cuts now.

Visiting a Tapa military base with shadow defence secretary John Healey, he thanked soldiers for providing “reassurance” through their presence at the base in the country bordering Russia.He added that “there is no time for party politics” because the world faces “a very grave situation” amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. A small number of serving British personnel are believed to have gone absent without leave to join the fight against the Russian invasion. Boris Johnson warned they would face court martial on theirto the UK, as Ministry of Defence chiefs have banned all service personnel from travelling to Ukraine “until further notice”.Armed forces minister James Heappey said earlier this week: “It is illegal for British service personnel to first of all go absent without leave in the first place, but to go absent without leave in order to fight in a foreign war is simply unacceptable, and frankly risks the United Kingdom being wrongly claimed by Russia to be a belligerent in this. “Service people who might think they are doing the right thing should reflect it is % not the correct thing to be doing.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBritish ArmySoldiersWar crimesCrimePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Days after the party fundraiser, on July , , the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines flight  was shot down by a surface to air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.And just months earlier, Putin had faced international condemnation over the annexation of Crimea.But speaking to LBC Radio’s Andrew Marr today, the former PM insisted Mrs Chernukhin had attempted “absolutely no influence” on UK policies on Russia.Askedhe remembered the game, he said: “I do, I remember - and there was absolutely no conversation about Russia, finance, Putin or anything .”  “We had a very careful system for vetting who could and could not give money to the Conservative Party. “A small handful of people had any connections with Russia, and as I’m concerned most of them were dissidents, often Ukrainians.” Mrs Chernukhin was born in Russia, studied in the United States and became a British citizen in .

But they do not single out the Prime Ministers behaviourBoris Johnson at a No press conference the day before the lockdown Image: Ian Vogler   Daily MirrorByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsThe government today announced the full list of issues that will be covered by the Covid public inquiry. Boris Johnson announced an inquiry last year after fury at his slow decisions to lock down, which scientists believe cost lives.It will start hearings in the spring and publish any reports in a timely manner, though many fear this will not happen until the next election.Todayaposs draft Terms of Reference do not name Boris Johnson or promise to look at the inidual behaviour of the Prime Minister. That could come as a blow to bereaved families after ex-aide Dominic Cummings accused him of a litany of failings.But they do vow to look at how prepared the government was and how decisions were made, communicated and implemented, including in the disastrous month before lockdown was imposed on  March . While the inquiry will not investigate inidual cases, it will listen to bereaved families and seek to learn lessons for any future pandemic.Scroll down for the full terms of reference - or have your say in the comments. Importantly it will also have reasonable regard to relevant international comparisons, suggesting the levels of death and disease in the UK could be compared to other European nations. And it will look at the response for shielding people, the poorest forced to rely on sick pay of less than £ a week, and those subject to aposdo not resuscitateapos orders. It will examine the response for care homes, where the virus swept through killing tens of thousands of people despite ministers pledging a aposprotective ringapos. But the inquiry will also look at the merits and problems of lockdown itself, not just the virus response that triggered it.Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: “The inquiry is a one off and historic opportunity for the terrible suffering and loss of the past two years to be learned from, to ensure these tragedies are not repeated in the future. “The Government finally publishing the draft Terms of Reference is a huge step forward, and we look forward to feeding into the consultation on them. “Sadly, today’s announcement comes far too late. We will never know how many lives could have been saved had the Government had a rapid review phase in Summer , as we called for at the time. “Crucially, Boris Johnson must now commit to implementing the chairaposs recommendations for the Terms Of Reference in full. The fact his office is under police investigation for breaching their own rules means thathe attempts to interfere with what the inquiry looks into, it risks ruining its credibility before it’s even begun.” Boris Johnson suggested the terms of reference will changethere are complaints, as there will be a four-week period to consult on them. He said: It is vital that we get its terms of reference right and that people can have their say. To deliver this, Baroness Hallett will now lead a period of public engagement and consultation, which will last for four weeks. This process will inform further refinements to the terms of reference before they are finalised and the inquiry begins its important work. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the findings must be delivered before the next general election.” Here is the full list of whataposs been announced today by the government, in the governmentaposs own words.

In meeting these aims, the inquiry will:listen to the experiences of bereaved families and others who have suffered hardship or loss as a result of the pandemic. Although the inquiry will not investigate inidual cases of harm or death in detail, listening to these accounts will inform its understanding of the impact of the pandemic and the response, and of the lessons to be learned highlight where lessons identied from preparedness and the response to the pandemic may be applicable to other civil emergencies consider the experiences of and impact on health and care sector workers, and other key workers, during the pandemic consider any disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic and the state’s response, including those relating to protected characteristics under the Equality Act  and equality categories under the Northern Ireland Act , as applicable have reasonable regard to relevant international comparisons and produce its reportsand any recommendations in a timely manner.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonHospitalsCare homesNursing homesPublic inquiryPublic servicesPoliticsHomelessnessCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fuel’s gold The sanctions against Russia are not without cost. Motorists have already seen the price of a litre of petrol reach a record high after Western nations imposed embargoes on oil exports. Experts are warning that average energy bills could top £, a year by this winter. This squeeze on households will force more families to choose between heat and food.

The Government had promised to increase teachers pay by % over the next two years and bring them up to £k by September . But the proposed increases for more experienced teachers are lower, with increases of % in  and % in , equating to an average rise of just under % across all teachers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated. Given soaring levels of inflation, the proposals for teacher pay would see a real terms cut of % for more experienced staff between  and . And when taking the decade of Tory cuts to teachers pay the IFS estimates teachers will see a pay cut of % from  to .  For those at the top of the pay scale, equating to around a third of classroom teachers, this is equal to a pay cut from £, to £,. Luke Sibieta, research fellow at the IFS, said: The Governmentaposs proposals for teacher pay in  and  would enable them to deliver on a manesto commitment to raise starting salaries to £,. However, smaller pay rises of -% per year for most other teachers are likely to represent real-terms cuts and would follow on from more than a decade of real-terms pay cuts. There is also a risk that the highly unstable geopolitical and economic situation pushes inflation higher still. While there are clearly signicant pressures and demand on school budgets, schools need to be able to recruit and retain high-quality staff to meet those challenges. An increase in school funding of close to £ billion in  means there is room for a higher pay award within planned school budgets. A higher award than that proposed by the Government may carry fewer risks than a lower one. It comes as millions of workers are set to face a £, pay cut in April when inflation skyrockets due to Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine. MPs were told yesterday the cost of living crisis will prove fatal for some of the poorest families as Brits face soaring energy bills, rising inflation and national insurance hikes. Living standards across the UK will be slashed by around £, per household as Boris Johnson unveiled severe sanctions on the Kremlin. In the wake of this, the Chancellor faces a huge judgement call on whether to borrow or allow households to face the biggest price hike since the s, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has claimed.  IFS director Paul Johnson said: Will he do more to protect households from the effects of energy prices which have risen even further in the last two weeks  If he doesnapost then many on moderate incomes will face the biggest hit to their living standards since at least the financial crisis. If he does, then there will be another big hit to the public finances. Prices have already suged by .% in the year to January , due to rising energy, fuel and food prices. Labour has blasted the Tory Government for allowing the cost of living crisis to spiral over the last six months. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: The Conservatives should halt their National Insurance hike in April – and they must look again at Labour’s proposal for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut household energy bills by up to £. But we’ve also got to get out of this Tory high tax, low growth trap that is making our economy less resilient and leaving public services weakened. That means growing our economy – by buying, making and selling more in Britain and through our Climate Investment Pledge, Labour will get us firing on all cylinders. According to forecasts, someone on a median salary of £, is likely to be around £ worse off, thataposs £ more than earlier forecasts. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: Teachers and other educators are already in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis even before the impact of higher inflation.They canapost afford any more pay cuts, but the Government can afford to invest in our public services including education.Cuts to public sector pay damage the private sector too, due to the reduced spending power of public sector workers. Cuts to education cause signicant economic damage, because economic recovery depends on investing in the skills and potential of our young people. Government investment to protect our public services including education is essential, and that means restoring pay cuts instead of inflicting more of them.

The updated UK sanctions list said Mr Abramovich has had a close relationship for decades with Putin, which the football club owner has previously denied.The Russian businessman was named alongside billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska on the list, which imposes assets freezes, travel bans and a prohibition on transactions with UK iniduals and businesses. These elite iniduals have a collective net worth of £ billion, the Foreign Office said in an official announcement. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. Todayaposs decision brings the total number of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by Britain to , with another five already on the list. Sanctions have also been imposed on Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and a number of Belarusian officials  Liz Truss said: Today’s sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society. With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression.The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame. Boris Johnson said: There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putinaposs vicious assault on Ukraine. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was the right decision but it should not have taken the Government weeks. He said: Too few oligarchs linked to Putinaposs rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK Government. We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US.It is right that, under pressure from Labour, the Government U-turned to strengthen sanctions legislation. Ministers must now move faster to continue to close the sanctions gap.Here are the new names added to the sanctions list. Roman Abramovich Roman Abramovich is one of the most high-profile Russian oligarchs in the UK thanks to his ownership of Cha Football Club. Abramovich, who is worth an estimated £. billion and has a multi-million pound property empire in the UK, also has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, the UK Government said. He sold a % stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £. billion in . He recently announced plans to sell the top-flight football club, which he has owned since , after initially saying he was passing stewardship to the clubaposs charitable foundation. Abramovich has denied having strong ties with Putin but the Government said he had had received financial benefits from the Kremlin, including tax breaks for his companies, the buying and selling of shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and contacts in the run up to the  World Cup in Russia.The list shows he has been sanctioned both on the basis of his personal connections to the Kremlin and preferential contracts over the years, but also the role the Evraz steel company plays - the British government believe it is providing steel to the Russian military The football club has now been seized by the UK Government but ministers have issued a licence authorising Cha to continue playing matches. Season ticket holders and those with games already booked can still attend matches, but no new tickets can be sold and the clubaposs merchandise shop will close. Abramovich’s UK property will also be frozen with not even cleaners allowed to enter it. But the asset is still only “frozen” - not actually seized by the UK government. Technically the tycoon’s family - who are not directly targeted with sanctions - could stay in his homes but officials believe it would be practically very dficult. Oleg Deripaska Industrialist Oleg Deripaska, who is Abramovichaposs former business partner, was among those newly added to the sanctions list. The Russian tycoon has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world’s major aluminium producers. Deripaska is estimated to be worth £billion, with a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK.  He hit the headlines in  when he hosted Labour grandee Lord Peter Mandelson and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne on his yacht in Corfu. Mr Osborne was accused of trying to solicit a donation for the Tory party from the oligarch - something he denies. The US designated Deripaska in , which is means a personaposs assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them. Igor Sechin Tycoon Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. The UK Government described him as a particularly close and influential ally of Putin and he is understood to be regarded as Putinaposs number two.  He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. The French Government seized a yacht linked to the oligarch last week. Andrey Kostin Andrey Kostin is the chairman of VTB bank, Russiaaposs second largest bank. The bank was designated by the UK last month. The UK put his net worth at an estimated £ million. Kostin was described by the FCDO as a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through the bank.  He has previously accused the West of waging economic war against Russia through sanctions. He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. Alexei Miller The chief executive of Russian energy company Gazprom is one of the most important executives supporting the Kremlin. Miller served under Putin in the s when the now-President was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. UK officials believe he has been going along his career trajectory with Putin since the Russian President was was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in s.  Miller has already been sanctioned by the US. Nikolai Tokarev Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft. He served alongside Putin in the KGB in Dresden, East Germany, in the s. They have remained closely associated ever since. Tokarev has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Dmitri Lebedev Dmitri Lebedev is the chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya.

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

The history student first started feeling unwell in August , but she claims doctors told her she had a blockage in her body. The mum from Essex said: I was on the contraceptive pill. I was taking it every day and even through my pregnancy, I was taking it every day. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here I didnapost really have any symptoms. I was still having periods every month and didnapost have a bump or anything like that. When she first saw a gastroenterologist in October, Ellie claims she had blood tests which didnapost detect any hormones that indicated she was expecting. She recalled: The only reason I started going to the doctors was because I had stomach pain, was really uncomfortable and felt like I was putting on weight. I did a pregnancy test at home and thought aposoh, itaposs negative, it canapost be thatapos and had six doctors say that I wasnapost pregnant.  I went to the doctors and they looked me over, sent me for some blood tests and gave me a pregnancy test while I was there, and it came back negative. They thought it was something to do with my digestive system so I was sent to specialists. All of the easy stuff was being ruled out by tests and they thought it was quite serious and that I basically had a blockage somewhere. She even claims she had an ultrasound scan on  December which didnapost detect anything in her womb - but the following day she realised that wasnapost the case. After going out for dinner to celebrate her grandmotheraposs birthday, Ellie went to bed but woke up hours later with excruciating stomach and back pain.  After throwing up for the next four hours, Ellieaposs mum called an ambulance at am and she was rushed to AE. Ellie recalled: I went for a wee and it felt like all of my lower stomach muscles were just pulling and I thought aposthereaposs something there, thereaposs something going on thataposs not quite rightapos. While on the toilet, Ellie screamed out to the nurse who rushed in to examine her. I said the pain was really bad and worse than it ever had been and they basically pushed me onto my side and her head was born, and that was the first time I knew that I was one, pregnant, and two, in labour, she recalled. Her head came out and the doctors recoiled back from the bed and said aposwe need to get a midweapos and pulled the panic button. At that point I had another pain and she was delivered on the bed behind me.  I didnapost quite believe it. I thought I was hallucinating at that point as well because of the pain and then I had this bundle put next to me and cuddled up with me, and there was a little baby face. And that was the first time I kind of fully believed that this was happening to me. Ellieaposs daughter Alicia was born at .am on  December  weighing lbs oz. Ellie claims she had been taking the contraceptive pill for six years and was advised by doctors that this meant that it wasnapost as effective as it should have been. She was also told it was regulating her hormones, which is why her pregnancy wasnapost detected via tests. Ellie believes her pregnancy wasnapost spotted on the ultrasound because Aliciaaposs back was against her spine, which also explains the excruciating back pain she experienced during labour.  After Ellieaposs friends and family got over the shock, they rushed to her aid to provide the new mum with nappies and baby equipment - seeing as sheaposd not had time to get anything ready for Alicia. Ellie said: Because I was still in that panic mode, my first reaction was aposI canapost be a mum, I canapost do it, please donapost.apos I spent  minutes alone with her and said aposyou know what,my body could have done that, I can do it, itaposs meant to beapos and I just fell in love with her at that point anyway. I rang my friends and they didnapost believe me, so they had to come to the hospital and they all cried. I think I was the only person that didnapost cry, because I was still in a bit of a blur. Now Ellie couldnapost imagine her le without Alicia, who she describes as a whirlwind of energy. She said: Sheaposs an absolute little fighter, she had nothing wrong with her and we joke that she was pickled through the pregnancy.Did you have a surprise miracle baby  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcBut she is incredible, smart and she started walking when she was -months-old. She is just amazing and full of beans. I canapost imagine my le without her now. Itaposs crazy.

Dubbed ‘Deltacron’, the new French-based strain combines both lineages. However, its severity is not yet known.But there is a warning that immunity is waning in the elderly as one scientist added that it is aposthe real thingapos. The World Health Organisation said it is apostracking and discussingapos the iant following research into the strain. There is no clear data yet to show whether Deltacron is more infectious than its predecessors. Health chiefs told The Sun a very small number of cases have been detected in Britain, but more details are to be reported in a briefing on Friday.Aris Katzourakis, professor of evolution and genomics at the University of Oxford, said: “It is one to keep an eye on.

Dr Stephen Grfin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: “Whilst it doesn’t seem to have taken off as a dominant strain yet, this could be due to a very slow start based upon seeding density - the number of initial cases, he said.“There are multiple scenarios that can play out here in terms of what this means for people that become infected as this combination of viral proteins may behave dferently to either parent. “The French cluster appears to be a validated occurrence where a recombination event has given rise to a virus fit enough to circulate.Last month, the UK Health Security Agency announced it was investigating a iant named “Delta x Omicron Recombinant ”.However, it is not knownthis is linked to the French-based Deltacron.

In it, they opened up about many members of the Firm - with Harry accusing his dad Prince Charles of cutting him off financially and not taking his calls. Even after the explosive chat, he appeared on the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting and talked about total neglect on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See. Later reports claimed that relations between the pair were at rock bottom - but recently there have been signs that Harry, Meghan and Charles could be ready to bury the hatchet. Here we take a look at them... Full of praise  One of the first signs that Harry and Charlesapos relationship could be improving was just a few days into . Charles wrote an essay for Newsweek, where he issued a call for urgent action to save the environment.In the piece, he praised both Prince William and Harry for their work in raising awareness of the issue. He spoke about how he was proud of both of his sons for having recognised the threat of climate change. He said: Most recently, my elder son, William, launched the prestigious Earthshot Prize to incentivise change and help repair our planet over the next ten years by identying and investing in the technologies that can make a dference. And my younger son, Harry, has passionately highlighted the impact of climate change, especially in relation to Africa, and committed his charity to being net-zero.

Shortly after the Newsweek essay was released, the Mirror revealed that Charles had held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with Harry. Sources close to Charles said that despite reports of the two not speaking, Charles and Harry have been on “a journey of rediscovery” in terms of their relationship. One said: “The Prince of Wales has spoken to his son frequently in recent months. He loves him very much, as he does both his children, and he looks forward to them being able to spend time together in the near future.” Regular contact And it seems these video calls might not be a one-off for Harry and Charles and itaposs been suggested they talk regularly.Thataposs because, writing in the , royal expert Camilla Tominey claims that Prince Charles is thought to be in regular contact with his youngest son.However, she added: Whether Meghan will everto the UK remains to be seen. Olive branch invitation Meanwhile, it has also been reported that Charles offered his son an olive branch by offering him an invitation to stay with him the next time he brings his family to the UK.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood. But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. Meghanaposs photo Meanwhile, another sign came on Tuesday when eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a touching photo of Meghan Markle that has pride of place in Charles and the Duchess of Cornwallaposs home.Camilla welcomed three female rowers, who crossed the Atlantic in record time, to Clarence House - the London home she shares with Charles - to mark International Womenaposs Day. They were joined by former male rower Tim Christian and were pictured chatting with Camilla in a sitting room at the royal residence.  Behind where the guests were sitting, royal fans noticed a side table that was filled with lovely family photos. And one of them included a stunning black-and-white image of Meghan with Charles on her wedding day in . When Meghan married Harry, Charles escorted the bride halfway down the aisle of St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - and the framed photo appears to depict this.

Others who stayed at The Airport Hotel in Manchester claim there was a huge stench of cigarette smoke and alleged their bedding had not been changed for three weeks.The budget hotel has faced complaints from multiple guests online, and some have claimed that they found suspicious stains on a duvet and dirt throughout their bedroom, ManchesterEveningNews reports. The accommodation, which is rated two out of five bubbles on TripAdvisor, is owned by Britannia Hotels - which has recently been voted the worst hotel chain in the UK for the ninth year running.In recent weeks, a series of terrible reviews have been shared on the travel site, and guests at the Northenden hotel branch branded it diabolical and filthy. One guest, named Emma, claimed that she had been staying in the hotel after fleeing domestic abuse. Rating the hotel just one star, she wrote: Cleaning staff haven’t changed my bedding in THREE WEEKS actually think I’m going to be sick from how they’ve treated me. Another, named Laura alleged she had an awful experience where she found herself sinking right through the mattress through to the other side. Laura claimed that after she changed rooms three times she ended up in one with stained bedding. She said: Given room  and wanted a little sleep. Pulled back the duvet and the bed springs were coming through the mattress so we were given another room on the same floor. I sat on the bed and sunk through it! It jolted my back really badly. I took a picture of the mattress to show the manager.  Was given a third room and the manager came with us and again a mattress with the springs sowingthrough. He admitted that all the mattresses in the hotel were in the same sorry state. So I asked for spare duvets to sleep on to try to create padding from springs. One of the spare duvets had blood on it! I then got the spare pillows down and they had hairs all over them from a previous guest. Also there were chocolate buttons under my bed and a chupa cup wrapper under my friendaposs bed. Certainly not cleaned. Putting hygiene sticker on the door make no dferenceyou do not vacuum the floor! She also claims that she woke up in the morning with terrible back pain and was forced to lie on the dirty floor to try and relieve it. Another guest, Catherine B, said it was the worst hotel she has ever stayed in. She said: Our allocated room was an unprepared room that had not been cleaned, it had dirty sheets on the bed that had clearly been slept in and mud on the carpet. This was rectied, but our subsequent room was dreadful. The mattress had springs you could feel through the sheets, and the edge of the mattress had collapsed. The whole hotel is worn out and everything needs replacing. The lts smell of stale cigarette smoke. The whole place has an unpleasant odour, possibly due to the smoking rooms, and cigarette smoke infiltrating the whole building. Avoid at all costs.

The portrait, taken by esteemed photographer David Bailey in , captured a black and white side profile of the princess. Sheaposs posed in a satin one-shoulder dress, which has been paired with a teardrop earring as she looked off into the distance.This has been compared with some of the portraits released of Kate on her th birthday earlier this year, where she too can be seen wearing a similar style gown and looking away from the camera.

She doesnapost need to try to be someone  including Diana. Sheaposs great as she is.” The tweet sparked discussion among royal fans, who were quick to also share their thoughts.One person said: I donapost even think she is trying to be Diana, I donapost see any major similarities to Diana apart from the fact that they are both beautul and kind. The Duchess of Cambridge never tried to be anyone  but herself, wrote another. She has been in the public eye for over  years. A lot longer than that of Diana. The Duchess of Cambridge has made her own mark and done things her own way including creating her adorable family. A third commented: Of course she canapost be compared to Diana. Diana was doing over  appearances every year, and so many tours and she was so young. She had a huge influence on pop culture and her Charity work remains unmatched. So yeah. No comparison. While someone  put: Spot on Angela! Nor is she trying to be anyone . It’s certain people pushing that nonsense.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The Money Saving Expert founder warned about forthcoming price rises which will impact Brits in the coming months.Martin revealed that the price of stamps and prescriptions will rise from April , the Manchester Evening News reports.First class stamps are going up by p to p, and nd class stamps will now cost p, up by p. Consumer expert Martin issued a useful tip to adults in the UK to help them save money ahead of Christmas. The key rule here is to stock up now on these class stamps i.e those that say first or second. In the past when prices went up Iaposd always say you could use them indefinitely but you can only use these until January , , Martin said.  So buy [these] Christmasapos stamps nowyou can do so. Ordinary stamps are set to be replaced by bar coded stamps from February . Martin also advised that you could still buy the existing stamps now, and then swap them in for the new ones via a free scheme that is going to come later in the year. Butyou are going to use stamps in the future, you may as well buy them in now whilst they are cheap, he added. His advice comes as family finances face being stretched as Ofgemaposs price cap will rise for  million homeowners, with the average household bill increasing by around £ per year.Earlier this week Martin issued a new video with three things everyone must do before prices rise on April . This included checkingyou can stockpile energy now to beat the price hike, taking a meter reading nowyou pay by direct debit and checking how you can claim a £ council tax rebate from April. Keep an eye out for a letter from the council because each council will tell you its claim system and you need to watch for that,” said Martin. If youaposre not eligible for the £, say, because youaposre in a higher band, then there is a discretionary £ million fund being set-up to help those who are struggling. “It will be up to each council to decide how it distributes it, but be ready to claim that.

An official report said Mr Pitt died aged  after falling victim to a huge Covid outbreak at the prison near South Cave on the outskirts of Hull.Mr Pitt died of Covid- on March , , aged .Hull Live reports that Mr Pitt, who was a serial criminal with a history of violence, had served almost eight years more than his original sentence after he was jailed for attacking a former partner.A judge had described him as an obvious and gross continuing danger to the public. Mr Pittaposs partner had been tied up naked and threw herself ft from a window to escape him when he attacked her out of the blue at their home in Northumberland, trying to gouge her eyes out and threatening to cut her throat with scissors.  In July , Mr Pitt was given a minimum four-and-a half year imprisonment for public protectionsentence for  imprisonment. He was moved to HMP Humber in . An independent investigation by the Prisons and Probations Ombudsman has found that Mr Pitt caught the disease in the prison during a apossignicant outbreakapos in February and March . The ombudsman said she was concerned that when Mr Pitt tested positive for Covid-, healthcare staff did not take his clinical observations and he was not monitored to seehe became symptomatic. Mr Pitt was obese, which meant that he was at a higher risk of developing complications, and should have been closely monitored and his observations taken regularly, the report says.

The collision, which involved a motorbike and a Nissan, happened in Liverpool on Wednesday at about .pm.Afterwards, the motorbike was reportedly left in the middle of the road in flames after the rider ran off from the scene, LiverpoolEcho reports. Jake Carter, from Childwall, has shared Ring doorbell footage and a CCTV clip of what happened on his TikTok page after the crash happened outside his home. The -year-old claims the Silver Nissan, which was hit by the scrambler bike, belonged to a mechanic who was coming to his home to look at a car.  He claims the mechanic indicated and drove towards his house and onto his drive. However, he claims that as the driver turned into the driveway, two scrambler bikes flew up the road and smacked into the back of the Nissan. Ring doorbell footage shows one of the riders jumping on his wall and screaming: You nearly killed me lad. What were you doing   In footage shared with the ECHO, a masked person wearing a balaclava can then be seen jumping onto the bonnet of a Range Rover on the drive and smashing it with his foot. The Range Rover was not involved in the crash. Speaking over the TikTok video, which shows the CCTV footage, Jake Carter said: Three lads wearing balaclavas were extremely confrontational and aggressive to the gentleman.  The mechanic is an older guy who is lovely and he was extremely shook up [sic] by this situation. But then one of the three musketeers decides to do a little bit of a jigg on the wall before jumping onto my dadaposs car and basically kicked the windscreen in. Spiderman then jumps back on the wall before fleeing the scene on another scrambler. Jakeaposs video of the crash and the thug later vandalising his dadaposs car has been viewed on TikTok more than , times.  It was shared on his page @Jakecartermusic with the caption: Help us find who these scumbags are, someone must know something  They’re missing a scrambler now! Please share.

Dominique Nicholson had a three week old newborn, Erin, when she was given the heartbreaking news that her severe headaches - which she claims were dismissed for months whilst pregnant - were down to a grade  atypical meningioma brain tumour. The -year-old from Leicester underwent surgery to have % of the mass removed just weeks after giving birth. She was so frightened that she even wrote goodbye letters to her young daughters, Erin, now two, and Freya, now six. The mum-of-two said she was left feeling numb at discovering the real reason behind her severe headaches, but that maternal instinct to watch her daughters grow up kept her determined to survive.After undergoing craniotomy surgery in July , she is now in recovery and has yearly checks. Dominique, who is sharing her story to raise awareness, said: I had headaches when I was pregnant with my first daughter, Freya. So when I had headaches with Erin, I wasnapost concerned, I assumed it was a mix of the stress of having a young child, working, being pregnant and generally tired. I mentioned my headaches to my midwe around five times, but she agreed there was no cause for concern and I assumed once I had given birth they would ease. However, after Dominique gave birth the headaches continued to get worse.  She said: I was emptying the dishwasher and as I bent down, the pressure behind my eyes was intense and I fell to the floor in agony. My head was throbbing and when my husband, David, now , came home we went to the hospital. Dominique, a licensing conveyancer, was sent for a CT scan but couldnapost process the diagnosis. She said: Erin was just three weeks old and I expected to be told it was severe migraines.When the doctor explained it was a mass on the brain, I was in shock and very scared. My first thought was my girls. I had to see my daughters grow up. It was my maternal inner strength that got me through the surgery - my biggest fear was not waking up.Dominique wrote goodbye letters to her daughters before undergoing craniotomy surgery to remove all but a small percentage of the tumour which was wrapped around a major blood vessel. She said: I spent a lot of time sobbing in hospital. I needed to put things in place, so I wrote letters, arranged godparents and thought about things to help Davidsomething went wrong in surgery. I distracted myself as much as I could, preparing things for Dave in case I wasnapost there. Thankfully the surgery was a success and without complications and Dominique was able to go home soon afterwards. A biopsy revealed it was a grade two atypical meningioma. She added: I was diagnosed, operated on and home within seven days. There was a bit left attached to a blood vessel that was too dangerous to move but as I was breastfeeding Erin doctors knew that my recovery would be quicker at home. I needed to be with my family.  Dominique was left with a cm scar across her forehead and down the right-hand side of her face. She said: The scar was so much bigger than I expected and I tried to hide it from my eldest and bought headscarves. The scar was mentally hard to come to terms with and I can still feel the scars now. I also saw a counsellor as it was a lot to deal with. I spent a long time hiding inside when my face was at its worst, but gradually I made little outings to regain my confidence. I consider myself to be so lucky and I am grateful to be alive. I now have annual scans to checkthe tumour has come back. It is worrying to think it may come back and that does cause me a lot of anxietyI get a headache. The married couple have been together for  years and are looking forward to celebrating their -year wedding anniversary later this year.  Now the family are focused on raising as much awareness - and funding - as possible. She said: The Brain Tumour Charity is incredible and I just want to get as much awareness out as possible. I am running  miles to represent the  types of brain tumours that exist. I am very lucky to have been treated so quickly and I donapost like to think about what could have happenedI didnapost. I want to warn everyone - but especially mums and expectant mums not to put their own health last. You know your own body and what is normal andsomething isnapost right push for answers. My headaches were ongoing, I felt sick and I was forgetting things. If that sounds like you, please go to your doctor. This is Dominiqueaposs third year of challenges and this year she will be completing two Olympic Triathlon distances.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsPregnancyGiving birthBrain Tumours\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The terraced home in Christchurch, Dorset was listed on the market on Tuesday March . The large living room takes up over half of the downstairs and its main feature is a detailed ceiling painting that depicts angels flying and sitting on clouds. The depiction is bordered with round gold and blue trim with ious patterns.  A bust of a woman stands tall at the back of the room, while gold trimmed patterned chairs and couches are positioned next to the light blue walls. There is a marble coffee table that sits on an old fashioned royal-looking carpet whilst a large gold rimmed mirror hangs on the back wall. Breaking the Roman theme, there is a flat screen TV hung from the wall and a guitar amplier resting on one of the chairs.  Leaving the lavish room, the rest of the house appears to be far more common. The kitchen is of a good size and has a double glass door that leads to the garden. Two of the three bedrooms are of good size and can comfortably accommodate double beds, while the third room could only fit a single bed.  The only bathroom in the property is situated upstairs and has a large bath and a separate shower. In their listing on Rightmove, Goadsby, who are managing the property wrote: A spacious terraced home situated in a popular area being just yards from Two Riversmeet Leisure Centre with its golf course. Christchurch town centre is also easily accessible.  There is a covered entrance porch which has a storage cupboard, a door leads through to the lounge. The lounge is a good size with a front aspect window. A door leads through to the kitchen breakfast room which has ample space for a dining table whilst also having a good range of wall and floor cupboards with working surfaces over... There are  doubles, both having fitted cupboards and Bedroom  is currently used as an office.  The bathroom benefits from a corner bath with separate shower cubicle, pedestal wash hand basin and low level w.c. One social media user saw the unique living room and decided to share it on Reddit: For just £k you can enjoy the wonders of the Sistine Chapel from the comfort of your own living room. The post has over  likes and has been commented on over a dozen times.Reddit users found the living room amusing.@Grumpyandproud said: I was not prepared for that living room. @Keiepse wrote: aposThe lounge is a good size with a front aspect window.aposAmazing that the agent couldnapost think of anything  for the description. @Leftpillz commented: Itaposs a pretty appropriate design given the cityaposs name, Christchurch. @Nicowltan replied: That living room is insane, but Iaposm a big fan of the dog at the back door.@busyphil added: Wow.

Two years on, we have seen communities come together, neighbours look out for one other and groups form across the UKCharles Burrell Centre manager Nik Chapman, outside the centre in Thetford Image: MATTHEW USHERByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  Mar |comments At the peak of the pandemic, on the Henley Green estate in Coventry, residents got used to the sight of two top-of-the-range Jaguars delivering food.The local community centre had turned its ‘Grub Hub service’ into a delivery service for isolating residents. As it grew from  members to supporting , people, they had asked local business for support. “Jaguar Land Rover let us use two of their vehicles,” says Dianne Williams, , CEO of the Moat House Trust. “We went out delivering meals in these two white jags. It was brilliant.”We are days away now from the second anniversary of lockdown. Two years on, we have seen communities come together, neighbours look out for one other and groups form across the UK. Never mind that – to use words of one campaigning organisation – we were led by donkeys. The British public were lions – acting as a pride. This week, the Mirror has been celebrating working class solidarity and community spirit after revisiting our  Wigan Pier Project journey. Now, we are paying tribute to those who stepped up during the pandemic. From the Knowle West Alliance who fed people in Bristol, to an advice delivery service in Berwick-on-Tweed, to the Levy Corona Helpers in Manchester’s Levenshulme and Centre in Grimsby, this was a national effort carried out at grassroots level. Hyper-local micro-miracles that have changed the face of Britain. Over , mutual aid groups – modelled on systems of support used by black radicals in America – provided solidarity, not charity, supported by a staggering three million volunteers. Existing community projects transformed their provision. Trade unions turned out volunteers, as well as getting workers furloughed and preventing redundancies.  The Mirror teamed up with the Red Cross for a Kindness Will Keep Us Together campaign and more than , signed up. From driving people to hospital appointments to delivering essential medicines, more than , acts of kindness were carried out across the country in just the first four months of lockdown.More than , people signed up to the NHS volunteer scheme. In the first three weeks of lockdown, , people signed up to become community volunteers. More than , people donated their time in  to support the vaccine rollout.Groups formed to help with food shopping and food parcels, collecting prescriptions and providing dog walking. They helped tackle loneliness, were a source of trustworthy Covid information, set up community gardens, and much more. But most importantly, in dark times, every act of kindness was a beacon of hope. The Charles Burrell Centre in Thetford, Norfolk, became a hub for mutual aid that has never ended. “We had a lady in this week enquiring about eligibility for fuel voucher,” Nik Chapman, CEO of The Charles Burrell Centre in Thetford, says. “In the last eight weeks, she only switched her heating on for Christmas Day and had been eating all food cold. She has been making extreme decisions to stay out of debt.”  The Centre provides a supermarket, a community fridge, a hygiene and a fuel bank – services accessed by around , people. “It’s not just about any food,” Nik says. “We need to combat diabetes, obesity and rickets. Le expectancy in this part of Thetford is  to  years less than the more affluent parts. Part of that is nutrition.” He adds: “% of the people who come are employed – a lot work at local supermarkets but they can’t afford to shop there.” Some  miles away in London, the Manor House Development Trust realised many families were unable to home school because they had no internet access. “People would usually come to our spaces to use the wi, but during the pandemic we couldn’t do that,” CEO Simon Donovan, , says. So, they crowdfunded to get residents old and young online. They delivered art packs to kelp kids learning and connected knitters and sewers who got to work making PPE. More than  volunteers gave out , pre-cooked meals to local residents – , kilos of food. Two years on, some Mutual Aid groups have already pivoted to help refugees from Afghanistan, and now Ukraine – putting our government to shame. Meanwhile, the crisis after the pandemic is only just beginning. Vulnerable families face rocketing bills. Many are far worse off than when they were furloughed, while others have lost the £ pandemic uplt to Universal Credit.This incredible network of local groups stands poised to help – but it faces its own challenges, from volunteer burn out to a lack of footfall in charity shops and cafes. Locality – which supports local community organisations – will publish a new report next week that will argue government should put communities in charge of its levelling up funding – including the Community Ownership Fund and UK Shared Prosperity Fund. “Two years ago, an amazing thing happened,” Tony Armstrong, chief exec of Locality, says. “At our hour of need, we looked to each other for help and rediscovered the awesome power of community. Now government, funders and other decision-makers must put their faith in these organisations and give them the powers and resources to get on with the job. There can be no levelling up without powering up community organisations everywhere.”  Done properly, what happened during the pandemic can be a blueprint for Levelling Up. Instead of reinventing the wheel with top-down, eye-catching schemes, the government should strengthen existing community-led projects. “I think we all know it is going to get worse,” Nik Chapman says. “The cost of pretty much everything is rocketing. Undoubtedly the tragedy in Ukraine will have an impact. It’s a crisis.

A spokesperson for the venue said this could not come at a worse time, as the business is still recovering from the Covid lockdown.He told Nottinghamshire Live: It is just ridiculous. One of them distracted the member of staff by standing at the bar out of sight of the door. He was ordering another drink while the ladies in the group marched their children out, one under each arm, and bundled them into a couple of cars. Then they waited until the last guy exited and shot off. He went on and said: We started the business in , just before Covid hit, and so obviously it is a dficult time. The price of everything is going up massively. We have got wholesale beer increases of nearly p a pint this year to deal with. We are going to try to soak that all up, and we will try and fight all of that and then people are going to do that. It is not very helpful.  He said that while the incident hit the venue from a business perspective, it is the well-being of members of the staff that he is more concerned about. He added: The member of the staff that was on rang the manager and said he was upset and quite exasperated. He had been intimidated by their passive-aggressive behaviour - and he has blamed himself. It is awful because he was doing really well and was training to be in a managerial position. Now he has lost all of his confidence. It is not that it just hurts my pocket, the real problem is that the staff there are nervous now and do not feel comfortable.  The pub owner said that he has worked in the industry for about a decade - but that he has never witnessed anything like it. He added: The children were running around the restaurant, running up to peopleaposs tables, falling over things. And then they have left bowls of food upturned on the floor - I have never seen anything like it in ten years in the industry. It was just like a pack of bears had been in.Inspector Hayley Crawford, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We are pursuing lines of enquiry following a report that a group of people had attended The White Horse Inn in Barnby Moor, eaten a meal and left without paying.“Officers are making enquiries after the incident was reported to us at around pm yesterday. “To help us with our investigation we are urging anyone with information to please get in touch with us.” It is believed those involved left the area in a white van and a black car.

But it seems one man on Reddit didnapost get the memo, as he admitted he only recently found out about the special prize-winning eggs - just hours after polishing off a half white, half milk chocolate Creme Egg.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The student, who posted his story anonymously, confessed he had no idea that the egg was special until he saw an advert for the promotion just a few hours later when he had already eaten the chocolate treat and thrown the foil wrapper in a public bin.He said: I am an international student studying in the UK, and so I don’t really keep up with the ads here. A few months ago, Cadbury released  prize-winning eggs across the country with the chance of winning a range of cash prizes including £, .Long story short, I was scrolling through Instagram today and saw the prize-winning egg that looked identical to the one I ate a couple of hours ago. It then dawned on me. I potentially ate £,. The manaposs blunder has left him facing utter defeat as he comes to terms with the potential jackpot he missed out on, as he added: I don’t actually know what  to say other than utter defeat. I think I have officially hit the lowest point in the short  years of my le. While finding one of the rare Creme Eggs is a dficult task in itself, the chances of actually bagging £, are very slim - as only six of the  winning eggs are actually worth the top prize. The six eggs were hidden in an Asda, Co-op, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and an independent retailer, while a further three eggs worth £, on sale in a Waitrose, One Stop and a Booker shop.  Four eggs worth £, are being sold across Iceland and Booths stores, and there are  eggs with prizes of £, while the rest are scattered throughout participating retailers and are worth £ each. Commenters on the Reddit post were sympathetic to the manaposs plight, but many of them suggested he may be able to salvage his prizehe kept hold of his wrapper. One person claimed: To claim, you simply call a number that’s printed on the tin foil wrapping of the winning egg. While another added: Thataposs irrelevant. Evenyou ate the egg, the code you need is on the wrapper, you donapost need the egg itself. So you enjoyed the chocolate, get the packaging out of the bin and collect your winnings! Unfortunately for the student, he had been eating his egg while out and about - so threw the foil wrapper into a public bin and was unable to retrieve it. However, terms and conditions for the Cadbury Creme Egg hunt state that a picture of you not eating your winning egg may be required via email to prove that youaposre the rightful owner of the winning egg. Prizes must be claimed by June ,  and you’ll have to call a number that is printed on the tin foil wrapping of your winning egg to register your win.

There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

The -year-old, who lives out in Otago on New Zealandaposs South Island, lives an extraordinary le which involves performing dentistry on himself and not collecting any benefit to survive. There was no particular animosity or argument in the family that broke them apart - but the separation came after the death of Little Johnaposs brother which hit everyone very hard. Little John was battling addictions and watched the collapse of his relationship - and thataposs when he moved out to live in the cave. And he hasnapost moved for the last  years. After publication Stuff shared Little Johnaposs story, his family, including his sister based in Australia, got in touch saying they were so grateful for the words about him.Little Johnaposs sister said: It feels like a weight has been lted, no longer fearing the worst and wondering where he was. It also caused his father, who Stuff agreed not to name and who is based in Dunedin, New Zealand, to contact a foodbank to try to track him down. Michelle Kerr, from the Mosgiel Community Foodbank, told  News it was a huge step for him. Little John explained that he knew his fatheraposs address but hadnapost visited him since he moved to the South.  But on Wednesdaythe father and son were finally reunited after  years apart. Little Johnaposs dad said it was a wonderful experience. The pair enjoyed a meal and spent quality time together - Little John even spoke to his sister in Australia. Little John even found out his mother had died in . The father and son decided they plan to see each other again in the future.  Living several kilometers away from the closest human structure, Little John said itaposs there that he found peace with God and became close with his fellow Christians.Little John himself said the Stuff article had helped him too as he has been able to form bonds with local residents. Where previously they were wary of picking him up, he can now hitchhike. And a few weeks ago Little John said he heard people calling his name who had obviously gone looking for him. Struggling to find his cave at first, they began calling his name, to which he replied Gaposday. Little John said he had had some offers from hopeful aposcave womenapos, but not as many as he wanted. He particularly likes the cold months in the Otago caves and plans to spend winter there. Explaining why he lives in the cave he said for me itaposs natural, and natural is healthy.  He also doesnapost want to claim the unemployment benefit or eventually the pension because he said the money would give him access to his addictions. Little John explained heaposs always had a problem with booze and smokes but now he smokes and drinks much less basically because he canapost afford it. He has given up on Government support, come off the dole and closed his bank account in what he describes as a really big step. Doing odd jobs and using food banks, he gets by on around  a year. Little John added that he lives in a cave because itaposs free but also because nobody bugs him there.

The Russian military is now believed to be just three miles from the cityaposs limits, a senior US defence official said. A -mile long convoy of Russian tanks has been slowly advancing towards the capital as ambush attempts and shelling have been seen on the outskirts. Russian troops launched two attacks in the area - one in the western city of Irpin and another on the east side of Broy.

Putinaposs efforts to surround the capital continued today as more fighting has been reported on the southwest side of Kyiv.

Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in unorm with machine guns in their hands. Troops are warning civilians not to stray beyond the outskirts of the city because Russian vehicles had been spotted just a few miles away.  If Putinaposs troops encircle Kyiv, they could shell it as they have done to Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Ukrainian officials say Mariupol continues to be surrounded by Russian forces but is still in Ukrainian control. They said Ukrainian fighter jets and anti-aircraft missile units destroyed four Russian Su- attack jets and two Russian helicopters over the past  days.It comes as chilling photos from Mariupol showing corpses being discarded in mass grave sites as the death toll in the city grows.This week it was revealed more than , people have died in the port city, formerly the home of nearly half a million people, since the start of the Russian invasion.Described by rescuers as a humanitarian crisis, authorities have ordered workers to dig  metre long trenches as morgues are at breaking point.In tragic scenes, they were seen making the sign of the cross as the dead- wrapped in an old carpet- are pushed into the makesht mass graves.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match. MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"oban golfer bob shines in californian sun","story":"With  top  world-ranking players in the field, the honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member was going head-to-head with the one of the strongest fields assembled outside a major championship.Having shown signicant signs of ato form in his previous two tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, this was a chance for the left hander to build on his progress and climb back towards the top  in the world rankings.An opening level par  on Thursday left Bob in the middle of the pack after day one.

the Military Medal at the Battle of Longstop Hill. He was commissioned in the field in Africa.Later advancing through Italy, Germany and Austria, he ended his service in an Austrian town called Dolsech, after which his home in Campbeltown is named.During discussions on his war service with Lt Col Donald Ross OBE and Col Robert Steele, it became apparent that he had not been awarded the Territorial Decoration to which he was entitled.The army medals office was approached and it was agreed MajMcMillan should receive this honour and he was awarded the Territorial Medal in the Queen’s New Year’s Honours List.At a ceremony last week, his family joined him, including son James who travelled from Canada to witness the medal presentation at the former RAF airbase at Machrihanish.Major McMillan said: #I am delighted to see some of my oldest friends here and as well as receiving this medal, it has made my day.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOIslay’s Ardbeg Distillery has been bought by Glenmorangie plc for £ million.Allied Domecq plc, which owned Ardbeg Distillery, will receive £ million of the total sum in tranches within the next three years.The sale includes the Ardbeg brand, the distillery and surrounding land as well as the stock profile which will come on stream as Ardbeg -year-old and -year-old stocks mature.It will signicantly strengthen Glenmorangie’s current portfolio of malt whiskies which include Glenmorangie and Glen Moray and will provide excellent potential for new brand development, utilising the company’s proven experience in premium brand management.Commenting on the acquisition, Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman of Glenmorangie plc, said: #The company has made signicant progress since the introduction of a new strategy in .#We are particularly confident that our existing portfolio will continue to deliver above average growth and we wish to exploit our marketing capability to achieve a similar success rate with this Islay malt.#An opportunity such as Ardbeg, in a segment of the market which remains under developed, provides us with a rare opportunity.#Glenmorangie is well positioned in the Scotch whisky market, with a strong presence in the malt sector which grew by . per cent in the year to October  in export markets and by  per cent from January to October .FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Lachlan McKinnon, the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist officer, this week reported bumper bookings for the coming season.Talking to a Courier man, Mr McKinnon said that there had been a tremendous boom in the self-catering type of holiday.In fact, the association’s list of cottages, chalets and so on has become exhausted with the result that the months of June, July, August up until the middle of September are fully booked.A total of , enquiries were dealt with in the association’s Campbeltown headquarters by the end of February, an increase of  on last year.Mr McKinnon said he hoped the upward trend in self-catering holidays would continue further and preparations would be made to meet with the demand.It is hoped that the Arran-Kintyre ferry service proposed for this summer will be successful.Mr McKinnon’s plan is to bombard the landing jetty at Claonaig with advertising literature in an attempt to induce motorists south to Campbeltown.He feels strongly that the local authority, hoteliers and businessmen should spend more on advertising nationally in an all-out effort to attract tourism to the burgh.‘Unfortunately the tourist association does not have the money to advertise a specic place.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

paper characters and #Stikbot# figures.One week, they even tried their hand at pixilation which is animating with living human beings. The pupils all sat on the floor and the film made it look like they were moving in a line without moving their hands or feet.Jim Parkyn of Aardman Animations also joined in for a session and demonstrated how to make model characters from single pieces of plasticine, rather than adding bits together, as pupils# found these often fell apart.This skill has been used frequently since and some of these creations will be evident in the children#s own short animation films which will be showcased on the large screen at Campbeltown Picture House next week.Mhairi Hendrie from the cinema has facilitated the smooth transitions between the schools and ensured ample space was made available for sessions. This enabled the project to spread out and the children to have more hands-on experiences.Eoin Bruce from Campbeltown Grammar School is another expert who joined pupils and shared many technical know-how tips.There are two showcase events planned for Friday, March , and the schools hope people can go along to Campbeltown Picture House and join them.Glenbarr and Clachan#s films and awards will start at am.

Hogmanay festivals from  until .The new producers are being asked to deliver the traditional aspects of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay celebrations including a ‘signicant midnight moment’, which could include fireworks, drones, lighting, or another major spectacle to ring in the bells.However, they will not have to provide a street party.The tender specication document states: “Whilst previous events have incorporated live music and a large street party, the contractor is not obliged to repeat this format but must propose alternative entertainment that maintains or increases the media and audience impact.”Over the past two years, the Scottish capital’s traditional Hogmanay street party has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, but normally draws crowds of tens of thousands of people from across the UK and further afield.Historically, Edinburgh’s Christmas and Hogmanay festivals have taken place in the centre of the city at locations such as Princes Street Gardens and St Andrew Square, but in the new specication producers will also be asked to extend the celebrations to other parts of the city outside of the centre, such as light installations at Granton waterfront and Leith.For years, Edinburgh’s Christmas has taken place over a six-week period from around the third weekend in November to around January  and has featured activities including a market, fairground, family attractions and an ice rink.The council now wants to see Christmas celebrations distributed more widely throughout the city centre to avoid overcrowding, and the introduction of alcohol-free times and or areas.The specications were devised in response to the findings of a major independent survey into the future of Edinburgh’s Winter Festivals conducted last year.Edinburgh City Council leader, Adam McVey, said: “Through our citywide conversation with residents, businesses and stakeholders last year, it was clear that there was overwhelming support for the continuation of Christmas and Hogmanay celebrations in the Capital, but with a revised format.“More than , people and  organisations responded to the survey, with % expressing support for a Christmas celebration and % for Hogmanay.“I’m confident that by acting on residents’ feedback, we can remain the home of Hogmanay and ensure our Christmas events, enjoyed by so many across the City, continue in a way that balances residents’ needs and aspirations for how they should look and feel in future.”The tender responses will be used to draw up a shortlist for further consideration, and the council hopes to have a producing partner in place by the summer.For Hogmanay, the successful contractor will be required to “maintain the city’s Hogmanay Festival status as a world class event that promotes the city internationally”.Deputy council leader, Cammy Day, added: “Our winter festivals are internationally renowned and, from our conversation with the city, we were pleased that the majority wanted the capital to keep its place on the world map for Christmas celebrations and as home of Hogmanay.“As well as contributing to the wellbeing of our residents, our winter festivals deliver real economic impact, benefitting tourism, hospitality and leisure sectors in particular.“With these new contracts, we want to continue to provide inclusive, high-quality, festive celebrations, further enhance the city’s reputation and allow the benefits to be shared across our town centres and communities.” "},{"url":null,"title":"zoe-covid-study-uk-government-pulls-funding","story":"Professor Tim Spector said

government would \"see sense\" and reverse the decision.More than . million people have contributed to the app-based study with , daily contributions providing data on positive test results, symptoms and vaccine side-effecs.It provided evidence that the Delta iant was causing dferent symptoms to the original strain of Covid and led to Prof Spector lobbying the government to change official

His place in the team to play Italy tomorrow has gone to Glasgow back Kyle Steyn.The announcement of the suspension came from the RFU, England’s governing body, but Townsend believes the issue needs to be claried at global level. He cited a try in which South Africa winger Makazole Mapimpi handed off two Japanese players as an example of what is and should be allowed, and contrasted that with the ruling that has deprived him of Van der Merwe. “I was really disappointed with the decision at the time, and I’ve been scratching my head ever since,” the Scotland coach said. “We’re allowed to hand off in the game of rugby. It’s in the law book and something we do from a young age. It’s something which is celebrated.“So you’re allowed to put your hand in someone’s face, in the head area. So for someone to attempt that at high speed against another player who is going at high speed, who is upright trying to tackle him, and execute it in the end but on the way to doing that his forearm touches that player’s face ...  “The fine margin for that, from something which would have been celebrated as a great hand-off, to be sent off from the game and you are not going to play for three weeks, is ridiculous in my view. And World Rugby need to come out with a statement and make a distinction between something which is legal and encouraged in the game, and not put attempted hand-offs in the same criteria as a high tackle or a dangerous ruck clear.“They [the English ] followed the head-contact process, but I think that is wrong in this situation,” he added. “We should be protecting the attacking player in a circumstance like that when he is up against someone trying to tackle him upright.“So, obviously we’re disappointed for Duhan. He’s very upset. But we’ll move on, and Kyle will go and grab his opportunity. But I have real questions about the game and what we’re trying to do here, when a hand-off to the face is allowed and encouraged.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

When he plays he gives everything.“To score a goal, create a goal, work as hard as he did, he had a great night. He’s been a big player for us coming into the team.“What’s allowed us to get our win rate up has been work rate, and that work rate from players like him is so important.“How you press the game at the top end of the field, make it really dficult, that’s been the real foundation of our work, and he epitomises all of that. He’s been absolutely brilliant, and it was a great night for him.”Giving his overall assessment, Rodgers said: “I think you can see Rennes are a very good side. They made a better start, were quicker to the ball, and we were giving it away too cheaply.“But we worked our way into the game, and I think once we got the first goal, which was an outstanding goal, then it gave us real confidence in the game. Collectively we worked very hard, and we scored two outstanding goals.“Thegoal was a fabulous goal. Barnes’ touch was sensational, then he beat the full-back, got into the box, pulled it back and then Marc, what a finish that was. It just was such a great, great goal, and a wonderful finish.”Rodgers added: “- for me is a scoreline of endurance. It’s still you have to endure and suffer, because the opponent has nothing to lose, they can come after you. So we know we’ll be under pressure in the second leg, but we also know we can score goals.“You couldn’t be happier really with a first leg, but it’s only half-time.”Rennes failed to make the most of some notable chances, and were thwarted by Kasper Schmeichel with just over  minutes to go to when he made a good save to keep out a Martin Terrier shot.Rennes boss Bruno Genesio said: “I think we did lots of good things during the game. Technically we were good and we created chances.“But I think in football you have to be clinical at one end and score your chances and also very efficient at the other end, and more than anything  I regret the fact we conceded the second goal towards the end.“Sometimes you can make errors or mistakes, but I think tonight our game management at the end, there were a couple of times when we could have maintained possession of the ball, we gave the ball away and then we ended up conceding that goal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"papers-say---march-11  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

People across the generations put their best foot forward at the city’s Titanic Quarter dressed in neon and glitter to raise money for le-changing dementia support and research.Mervyn Currie, an engineer in the food industry from Glarryford, who lost his mum to dementia cut the ribbon to start the walk.He volunteered to be a steward at the event after witnessing the effects of dementia first hand when he cared for his beloved mum Hannah Currie throughout her journey with the condition.Taking part in Friday’s event was emotional for Mervyn and his mum was never far from his thoughts.“It did bring it all back as you are surrounded by people who have all gone through the same thing but there was a great sense of comradeship too.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences, I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honor and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Hannah’s husband Robert passed away in  and she enjoyed  years of good health, but after a while Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. She was taken to hospital following a fall, where she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Meryn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and a carers who visited daily.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died infancy.“At the start caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one but you can’t really talk to them.”Hannah sadly passed away in , aged .“When she died it was still very dficult,” said Mervyn. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.”Those taking part in Friday’s event completed a .km route though Belfast, stepping out to stop dementia in its tracks after a devastating period for those living with the disease.

The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , led by Environment Minister Edwin Poots, and Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey have bills that have reached the consideration stage in the Assembly.Whichever bill emerges, it is clear that signicant change to our socio-economic model needs to occur to reach any of the proposed targets. In , Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be . million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Northern Ireland accounted for % of UK greenhouse gas emissions in , compared to approximately % of the UK population. Agriculture , transportand residential buildingswere the largest sectors in terms of emissions. Mindful of the need to address this and maintain a viable economy, Daera has produced a draft green growth strategy which is about creating more green jobs and protecting or re-purposing existing jobs where possible.An important part of the draft green growth strategy is the new energy strategy from the Department for the Economy. It notes an ambition to deliver energy savings of % from buildings and industry by  and meet at least % of electricity consumption from a erse mix of renewable sources by .While the legislation may be edging forward and strategies are emerging, the current Northern Ireland report within the latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment makes for sobering reading. The Government is required by the Climate Change Act  to conduct such an assessment every five years to inform the UK National Adaptation Plans for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The assessment covers  specic risks and opportunities in detail across themes such as infrastructure, health, the natural environment, international dimensions and business and industry.Taking the business and industry theme, issues such as increased flooding of business sites, increased levels of coastal flooding, access to finance, worker productivity and disruption to supply chains could all be at risk from climate change.For example, the annual bill for damage for non-residential properties in Northern Ireland is expected to increase by % by  due to flooding events. The expected annual damages for UK business properties from coastal flooding is expected to increase by % by .The Climate Change Risk Assessment also suggests that there is a risk that access to finance, investment, insurance, and capital for businesses are negatively impacted by climate change through decline in availability and affordability of insurance, a reduction in the value of assets and investment and increased credit risks and cost of capital.Across Northern Ireland, this is currently a medium risk, but it has the potential to rise to high magnitude in future.With these potential risks fast approaching, finding a path to net-zero is crucial. The net-zero carbon roadmap produced for Belfast is enlightening in this regard. Currently, % of Belfast’s emissions come from the domestic housing sector, with transport responsible for % of emissions, public and commercial buildings for % and industry %.Belfast’s roadmap includes an assessment of the potential contribution of approximately  energy-saving or low-carbon measures.I don’t think anyone knows where the money is coming from to pay for these initiatives, but it may be the case that a slowness to act has brought us to the point where we can’t quibble on the cost.Andrew Webb is chief economist at Grant ThorntonMost ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Top VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlay moments captured by photographer Mark Condren at the Ukraine borderPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest EnvironmentFour main parties speaking out of both sides of their mouths on climate, claims Green Party leader Clare BaileyPedal power: Cycling Culcavy mum doing school run on two wheels after ditching carEnvironment In Focus: North West cricketers take on ‘responsibility’ of climate action as sport most vulnerable to changeAsk the expert: What Stormont can do to battle climate change issuesGreen is the new black: the rise of eco funeralsLatestJudges to rule over Met Police’s handling of proposed Sarah Everard vigilLong-awaited apology at Stormont for historical institutional abuse victimsDurham University accused of ‘cover-up’ over review of guest speakersHIA Inquiry recommended apology to victims, compensation and a memorialJussie Smollett sentenced to  days in jail for fake attack,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This was largely due to the implementation of a number of emergency grant schemes, designed to provide support to businesses and iniduals subject to closure or restrictions.Mr Donnelly’s reports highlight four Covid schemes, totalling £ million, which, although recorded in Invest NI’s accounts, were actually controlled and administered by DfE. These include the Small Business Grant Scheme and the Tourism and Retail Sectors Grant.INI was instructed by the department to include the expenditure within its accounts as it had the correct legal powers to make the payments, whereas the department did not.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Donnelly concluded that INI had no role in the schemes’ design or delivery and that the schemes were actually administered by the department, meaning that the expenditure should have been recorded in the DfE’s accounts.It also means that the expenditure was incurred by DfE without the appropriate legal authority. As a result, he has qualied both sets of accounts on the basis that this expenditure was “irregular”.He also concluded that INI’s financial statements did not provide a true and fair view of the substance of the transactions and he has provided an adverse opinion on Invest NI’s accounts on that basis.Both the department and INI were provided with an opportunity to adjust their accounts to resolve the issues identied by the audit. They both declined to do so as they do not agree with the independent opinion of the CAG.This disagreement has, in part, contributed to the lateness of certication and publication of the annual report and accounts of both organisations.Mr Donnelly commented: “My report acknowledges the speed with which these support schemes were designed and delivered.“It is important to stress, though, that the issues I have identied do not merely pertain to technical matters, but to fundamental principles and standards of accounting with which all public bodies should comply.”The report also sets out the CAG’s qualication relating to Covid- business support schemes administered by Invest NI totalling £. million in -.Based on how these schemes were designed, INI relied on self-declarations by applicants as evidence that certain eligibility criteria had been met, with no corroborating evidence. As a result there was “insufficient audit evidence” to confirm that expenditure was regular.These schemes were launched at pace in response to the continued impact of the pandemic on Northern Ireland’s economy.Approval for their implementation was granted by Ministerial Direction, since the Department’s Accounting Officer was unable to provide evidence that these schemes would provide value for money or that there would not be an unacceptably high risk of error or loss of funds.In addition, Mr Donnelly’s report on INI notes “irregular income and expenditure” relating to a £. million loan made in previous years to Glenmore Generation Limited – an anaerobic digestion facility.The Department of Financeconsidered this loan to be irregular, because certain conditions of its approval had not been complied with and further approval had not been sought.Irregularities were also highlighted in relation to a £.m payment to Tourism Ireland Limited, where again DoF approval was not obtained.Commenting on these qualications to the accounts, Mr Donnelly said: “It is completely unacceptable that a Department fails to comply with the requirements of primary legislation it is relying on to make payments.“This is a basic requirement, and it is extremely disappointing to see that the Department has failed to learn lessons from its past failure on obtaining approvals required for the Renewable Heating Incentive scheme.”INI published its - Annual Report  Accounts on Wednesday. They say the accounts have been qualied by the NI Audit Office in two areas – expenditure relating to NI Executive Covid emergency response schemes and expenditure relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility.Responding to the qualications Mel Chittock, Interim CEO, Invest NI said: “We acknowledge the decision of the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualy our accounts.“The global pandemic was an unprecedented situation which required implementation and operation of emergency schemes outside of normal process.“I am confident that all the necessary steps were taken to provide the best solutions to get much needed emergency funding to businesses. We complied fully with the instructions given to us and NIAO found no irregularities.”Addressing the qualication relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility in more detail, she said under the Sustainable Utilisation of Poultry LitterScheme INI provided funding towards the build and operation of two anaerobic digestion plants.“The aim was to help resolve a signicant local environmental issue and to help Northern Ireland comply with EU nitrates targets, as well as provide economic benefits by supporting growth in the agri-food sector,” Ms Chittock said.“It was always understood that the development of anaerobic digestion plants using innovative technologies was high risk. This risk was balanced against the environmental and economic benefits to the NI economy.“The Glenmore facility encountered technical and operational dficulties and in  the owner operator decided to refinance the business. As a result, Invest NI, and the main funder, will not receive aon the initial investment made.“However, the plant remains operational, is contributing to the objectives of the SUPL Scheme, and producing green energy for two NI manufacturing businesses.”A review highlighted that there could have been improvements in Invest NI internal processes and that it could have taken more steps to better mitigate and manage the loan investment in this project.However, the Department of Finance concluded that some of the conditions it put in place around the loan were not met, and now views the loan as an irregular spend.INI insists that it has tightened its processes and procedures and formed a new Invest NI Governance Council focussed on implementing best practice and improvements right across the organisation.A DfE spokesperson said as the Covid crisis gripped the country, the department and its arm’sbodies responded immediately, with  schemes delivered at a cost of £m. which helped tens of thousands of local businesses.It is therefore disappointing, and not for the first time, that the Department is forced to clary its position following an NIAO report,” he added.“The Department’s accounts were presented to the NIAO in May , as agreed. A delay arose because of the NIAO’s interpretation of an accounting issue it had not raised the previous year when the same schemes were delivered.Despite obtaining extensive and robust legal advice supporting its approach, the Department was unable to persuade the NIAO of its position a position that was universally accepted and supported across Government.The Department’s Accounting Officer shared his legal opinion and wider supporting documentation with the NIAO in an attempt to agree a consensus. Unfortunately, a resolution to what was, and remains, a subjective issue in accounting terms, prevented the accounts from being laid on time as anticipated.”Most ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Top VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlay moments captured by photographer Mark Condren at the Ukraine borderPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest Northern IrelandSuzanne BreenOpinion‘The look on Denis Donaldson’s face wasn’t even shock’ night hit team struckIan Rush backing £.m investment in Crusaders as stakeholder in Irama SportAllison MorrisOpinionDenis Donaldson’s fate was sealed, but who pulled trigger Four main parties speaking out of both sides of their mouths on climate, claims Green Party leader Clare BaileyFormer DUP MLA ‘may be open to chat’ about ing to party after electionLatestJussie Smollett sentenced to  days in jail for fake attackWhat the papers say – March British public to be asked to take in Ukrainian refugeesUkrainian MP urges West to protect citizens who remain as well as refugeesBrendan Rodgers hails impact of Leicester winger Marc Albrighton,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHome heating oil prices have increased dramatically.Allan PrestonTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTHE owner of a family fuel business in Lisburn has spoken of how “horrendous” price increases have driven some customers to tears — and others to abuse to staff.Anne Gordon is a partner with Stanley Gordon and Sons Fuel Group.It is currently capping sales to  litres of oil per customer, which yesterday was costing a “crazy” £. The price was just over £ this time last month.“The last week has been horrendous, the demand is so high and the stocks are so low,” she said.“We’ve just been getting whatever we can at the docks and it’s just coming through in small quantities.“Some of the customers have been very abusive. My sister works in the office with me and she was actually sworn at this morning.“I’ve been in the business  years or more and it’s the worst I ever remember it.”!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreWe are now living in ‘war-time conditions’, says Northern Ireland fuel poverty charityExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room She called for fuel prices to be regulated to protect those struggling to heat their homes.“This is not right. It’s not the normal distributors like us that are putting the costs up, it’s the bigger boys that are doing the price hikes,” she said.“We’re paying a surcharge on top of that as well. We’re very careful with our money, but I’m sure there are distributors out there who are going to the wire.“I’m quite scared to count up the numbers at the end of this month, to be truthful to you.“The Government does need to step up and do something, because people cannot survive, between the cost of their oil, electricity and food.“We’ve had people on here in tears because they can’t even afford to heat their houses.”Other fuel company owners shared similar experiences.Jean Irwin, who runs Gransha Fuels in Newtownards with husband David and son Alexander, said she had never seen such a dramatic spike in prices.The company is now delivering single drums to customers, with a cap of  litres.Yesterday it was charging £ for  litres.“We’re doing really long hours at the minute, delivering drums to people because the tankers aren’t delivering yet,” she said.“There’s a lot of very old people out there with no heat having to put on their coats.“There’s also young people with families who are struggling. It’s scary.”She echoed calls for the regulation of fuel prices.Eugene Hutcheon of Hutcheon Fuels in the north west said the frantic pace of recent weeks had just slowed down thanks to a few days of sunny weather.Yesterday he was charging £ for  litres. It was £ a month ago.“This is double the dearest price it has ever been before,” he explained.“It’s the surprise of customers: someone phoned the other day for  litres and it was costing £. They couldn’t believe it, as it was £ the day before. I had another customer getting in touch yesterday and they could only afford  litres when they heard the prices.“I’m a one-man band in my business. In the next few months you just don’t know what will happen because of the uncertainty of the war.”He said regulating fuel prices would take the pressure off, but he didn’t see how this could happen with so much of the world’s supply coming from Russia.Another company owner in Co Antrim, who did not wish to be named, said the market was in a “hateful” situation.Yesterday the company was capping sales at  litres . It was £ a month ago.“I’ve never seen a jump like this before in my career, it’s absolutely horrendous,” he said.“You would need a crystal ball. Personally, I think the prices need to be regulated because it’s unbearable. It’s unacceptable that the prices can change so much in a couple of days.“I know some firms are running around delivering at a loss, believe it or not. That’s because they pre-booked the orders, and with the costs going up it’s caught them out.”Meanwhile, police have urged homeowners to secure their oil tanks properly.Officers in Lisburn are investigating two reports of theft in the Dundrod area. Another two are being investigated in Strabane.The PSNI has advised safety measures like locking garden or drive gates, as well as disguising oil tanks with things like fencing or plants.Other steps can include installing CCTV, limiting the quantity of fuel in tanks, locking tanks, using a tank cage or guard, and installing a level gauge audible alarm.Related topicsCost of LivingMore On Cost of LivingWe are now living in ‘war-time conditions’, says Northern Ireland fuel poverty charityExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Cost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealed PremiumMargaret CanningOpinionCost of living crisis will only get worse as full impact of war in Ukraine still to be felt‘No plans’ to ration NI’s energy over supply fearsMost ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Top VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlay moments captured by photographer Mark Condren at the Ukraine borderPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest Northern IrelandLong-awaited apology at Stormont for historical institutional abuse victimsHIA Inquiry recommended apology to victims, compensation and a memorialSuzanne BreenOpinion‘The look on Denis Donaldson’s face wasn’t even shock’ night hit team struckIan Rush backing £.m investment in Crusaders as stakeholder in Irama SportAllison MorrisOpinionDenis Donaldson’s fate was sealed, but who pulled trigger LatestJudges to rule over Met Police’s handling of proposed Sarah Everard vigilLong-awaited apology at Stormont for historical institutional abuse victimsDurham University accused of ‘cover-up’ over review of guest speakersHIA Inquiry recommended apology to victims, compensation and a memorialJussie Smollett sentenced to  days in jail for fake attack,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is probably the most erse area in Belfast and of course there’s students here, nobody is saying they shouldn’t be able to go to and from their houses, but we have a right to enjoy St Patrick’s Day and every day.

When we need help is really when the council knocks off, which is at am when people are coming back from clubs and pubs looking for parties. We are all victims of anti-social behaviour.I think we do need them to take responsibility, whether that be the universities or the police. They can work together on this.”Catriona cited the fact that purpose-built accommodation specically for students, such as Queen’s University’s Elms Village, has   security, and welcomed something similar being introduced around the Holylands.“Maybe the universities can think of some form of security we can have between midnight and am in the morning, sothere is a problem, orsomebody is drunk, it’s dealt with straight away.”Belfast City Council and the PSNI said they “will be providing a high visibility presence” alongside other statutory agencies, which will include safer neighbourhood and alcohol enforcement officers, night-time noise and cleansing teams, and police patrols in the evenings and early hours of the morning.Ulster University and Queen’s University, Belfast said they are “fully supportive” of this and that “criminal behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated”.Most ReadNI motorists will cross the border ‘in their thousands# for fuel after Republic’s tax cutNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisCost of living crisis: Northern Ireland fuel and heating oil prices soar – weekly increases revealedThe John Hewitt: ‘End of an era’ for well-loved Belfast pub as it gets a new operatorExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Top VideosPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlay moments captured by photographer Mark Condren at the Ukraine borderPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest Northern IrelandSuzanne BreenOpinion‘The look on Denis Donaldson’s face wasn’t even shock’ night hit team struckIan Rush backing £.m investment in Crusaders as stakeholder in Irama SportAllison MorrisOpinionDenis Donaldson’s fate was sealed, but who pulled trigger Four main parties speaking out of both sides of their mouths on climate, claims Green Party leader Clare BaileyFormer DUP MLA ‘may be open to chat’ about ing to party after electionLatestJussie Smollett sentenced to  days in jail for fake attackWhat the papers say – March British public to be asked to take in Ukrainian refugeesUkrainian MP urges West to protect citizens who remain as well as refugeesBrendan Rodgers hails impact of Leicester winger Marc Albrighton,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s frankly embarrassingSouth College student Niall HignettStudents said the university response smacks of a “systemic cover-up”.South College student Niall Hignett, an organiser of protests on the issue during post-offer open days, told the PA news agency that the university had said it would deal with the matter “swtly”.“And what we’ve actually seen is delay, delay, delay,” he said.“To be honest, I’m really disappointed with the statement. It’s frankly embarrassing.”Mr Hignett said the issue was not about free speech, “it’s about student welfare and wellbeing – because the event wasn’t an academic setting there was no room there for academic debate”.He added that in the university’s statement, multiple references were made to freedom of speech.Mr Hignett said: “Our main contention now is that Tim Luckhurst was shouting at students – he showed himself to be incredibly unprofessional.”He said the review of the existing investigation was “a complete abdication of responsibility” and a “systemic cover-up”.An apology from the university management, who provided the environment which allowed this event to occur, wouldn#t go amissSara L Uckelman, Durham University and College UnionIn their statement, the university management had shown themselves to be “puppets of culture war proponents” while failing to support marginalised students, he added.Students have planned protests on post-offer visit days on March  and .Student ambassadors on the days have been advised to be “professional in your outlook when asked about the protests and any other issues”, adding: “Your personal opinion may have to be separated from your position as an employee.”Sara L Uckelman, associate professor of philosophy at Durham, and equalities co-officer for Durham University and College Union, said the union “will certainly be continuing to press the Durham University management for a clear and unambiguous statement that the behaviour that was seen at the South College formal last December is unacceptable and will not be tolerated”.“There is no way that the university can credibly claim that they are serious about providing an open and undiscriminating environment that is supportive of everyone – no matter class, gender, race, sex, or gender –they do not unequivocally condemn this behaviour. It goes against everything that DUCU supports, including equality and the right to all students and employees to study and work free from harassment and abuse.”She added that it was “not enough” for management to say they would make recommendations to the senate on how guest speakers were engaged for events.“They must also say why no such policy existed before now, or –one does – why it was not followed. It is also not enough for the management to say that they cannot comment on any inidual consequences that may happen as a part of a disciplinary matterthey must also say what positive steps they are going to do to provide redress to the students affected by the South College events. An apology from the university management, who provided the environment which allowed this event to occur, wouldn’t go amiss.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

The festival was last held in .Cllr Hanna said that while it was disappointing that this yearrsquos event would not be going ahead, a number of suggestions for an alternative festival had been made. He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July. It will replace the townrsquos previous mart which closed two years ago.However, the mart is part of a much larger project which includes plans for animal processing facilities, a conference centre and extensive retailing outlets.Mr Hugh Linehan, chairman of the co-operative, says it will be the most advanced project of its kind in Northern Ireland and will bring jobs and wealth to the area.ldquoWe see this as the way ahead for local agriculture, Mr Linehan said yesterday.Funding for the mart phase is largely complete. The co-operative has already raised approximately pound, in either shareholdersrsquo capital or in loans. Grant aid from the Food From Britain scheme is also being sought.STRANGFORD ndash A controversial plan to build a new ferry jetty in Strangford has been vetoed by residents.Residents have voted overwhelmingly to reject a pound, scheme by the Department of Environment to build a new mooring jetty away from the main harbour area.A  metre-long steel structure, to be built alongside existing dry-dock facilities, was condemned as a potential eyesore within a designated conservation area.The decision came at a packed public meeting on Wednesday night and it means that the scheme, which could have got underway by October, has now effectively been scrapped.DoE officials had insisted the project would only go ahead subject to local approval.They had taken the view that the jetty would provide a mooring base for the two car ferries, therefore releasing the main quay and much of the harbour for recreational use.The decision to reject the proposal has also thrown into doubt the future of an improvement package for the village which includes the replacement of the existing ferry terminal, environmental improvements and a new traffic system to reduce congestion.Residents were told that money would be made available for the entire project, on condition that the jetty proposal was accepted. With that acceptance not forthcoming, the money is no longer guaranteed and a fresh bid for funding will have to be made.ARDGLASS ndash A Government minister has been challenged to sanction the ldquospending of buttons to end more than  years of misery for the residents of an Ardglass housing estate.Ardglass SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said yesterday he has written to Stormont Minster Jeremy Hanley demanding immediate action to solve the problems associated with Mill River adjacent to the villagersquos Seaview housing estate.ldquoI have submitted a full dossier on the history of long delay in resolving this problem, explained Mr Curran.ldquoSince  I have been asking for the culverting of this river.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Her love for musical theatre was born and she later took on ious lead roles.She has a dream of continuing on with musical theatre work after studying it at university and has her eyes set on top roles.ldquoMy favourite roles would be Angelica in Hamilton, Vivian in Legally Blonde and Mrs Lovett in Sweeney Todd, she said. ldquoThese roles were all strong, independent women.Eva has struck up a great working partnership with fellow St Patrickrsquos students Lucien Coole and Edward Gilmore in their busking three-piece, The Thing Is.They have recently been employed at the Downpatrick Artisan Market, and on St Patrickrsquos Day will be providing entertainment in Downpatrick.Eva will also be entertaining the audience at the St Patrickrsquos Centre tonight during Gerry Kellyrsquos interview with Patrick Kielty. She will be singing No One Is Alone. Gerry, Patrick and Eva are all alumni of St Patrickrsquos High School.The BBC School Soloist of the Year  final is available to watch on the BBC iPlayer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Stunning floats set to bring splash of colour to parade  ","story":"NEXT weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick will feature a number of stunning floats based around Irish mythology.Downpatrick Town Committee and Down Community Arts have been busy working on five superbly crafted floats which are set to make a major impact next Thursday and turn heads as the festival parade makes its way through the town.With funding provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, hours of painstaking work will be revealed next week.Philip Campbell, from Down Community Arts and a member of Downpatrick Town Committee, is pleased with the spectacular new floats and hopes that the collaboration which made them possible, will continue for the next few years to create even more stunning pieces of work.Children from a number of Downpatrick primary schools are also involved in the project and itrsquos expected that around  of them dressed in costume will accompany the five floats.This week, the children have been taking part in workshops to help complete the floats and prepare for Thursdayrsquos parade.ldquoA lot of work has gone into preparing for the festival parade and we are delighted with all the support that we have received, said Philip.ldquoThe financial support from the local council and the Arts Council has been major benefit and we have been able to source all the materials that we need locally which has helped support local businesses.Philip said it has been good to involve local primary school children in the project and has thanked them and their teachers for taking part.Work has been continuing to build the floats in the Down Arts Centre with one of the stunning new creations being made in Lurgan, but will be transported to Downpatrick for the big day.ldquoWe have been working on the project since January  with the help of local artist Kieron Back and Rab Galbraith and John Wilson from the Town Committee have played key roles in getting us to where we are today, Philip continued.ldquoThe theme of the floats is Irish mythology and they include the Brown Bull of Ulster, Legananny Dolmen and Manannaacuten mac Lir. The float being built in Lurgan features the Children of Lir.Philip said all those involved with the Downpatrick parade are conscious that the last event was held in .ldquoWe are making the most of the opportunity to participate in the first major outdoor event staged in the district since the coronavirus pandemic, he said.ldquoOur aim is to build on the work we have done this year and secure additional funding over the next two years so that by  we could have up to  floats in the St Patrickrsquos Day parade.Philip said Downpatrick Town Committee is keen to maximise the opportunities the town has and also make statement that it has the biggest March  cross-community festival parade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"There is no food%2Cno water%2Cno gas and the city outskirts  are surrounded by landmines  ","story":"A UKRAINIAN woman is desperate for help in securing visas and safe passage to bring her mother, brother and sister-in-law to County Down.Iryna Johnston and her husband Jonathan are calling on people to sign a petition calling on the Government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming to the UK.After days of waiting on word from her family as they shelter in bombed city of Mariupol, the local couple were relieved that she received message only saying ldquoWe are alive on WhatsApp yesterday morning.The couple do not where her family members are staying in the encircled city in the Donetsk Oblast area or how long they will be safe.ldquoThere is no food, no water, no gas and the city outskirts are surrounded by landmines and itrsquos snowing there, said Mrs Johnston.Refugees escaping from Mariupol were targeted just days ago when an agreed safe corridor was disrupted by Russian shelling.The city sits in a strategic location, splitting Russian forces on the annexed Crimean Peninsula from separatist troops in eastern Ukraine.Mrs Johnstonrsquos mother, Tamara, is in her early seventies and is believed to be with her son, Alexander, and his we, Olga, who live nearby.Mr Johnston said that he and his we are desperate that they leave Mariupol and get to safety.ldquoWe would take her mother and family, even cousins and other in-lawsthey could get visas, he told the Recorder.ldquoEventhey could get a visa to Dublin, I would happily rent a place for them just over the border near Newry, then they would only be about  minutes away.He said that another possible route to safety may be for his wersquos family to go to St Petersburg where his sister-in-law still has a flat.ldquoWe just want them to be safe. Politically the situation is much more complicated in the eastern part of Ukraine. People in the eastern part of the country are very Russian. But % of the people in the Ukraine donrsquot care about politics and just what a happy, peaceful le.Mr Johnston described the now impractical steps his relatives which have to taken in order to get a visa.ldquoThey would normally have to travel  hours on an overnight train from Mariupol to Kyiv to get a visa granted for travel. In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city. They had spent so much money on the city and now itrsquos ruined.The couple met in Ukraine while Mr Johnston, a flutist, was performing in cruise ships and his we was a concert pianist.To sign the petition to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming into the UK visit https:petition.parliament.uk petitions ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaLestyle Live Here Love Here  They why not join the Big Spring Clean  Claire CartmillCrime Shotgun and ammunition discovered in NI town - appeal for information Gemma MurrayEnvironment Assembly passes Edwin Poots’ climate change Bill PA ReporterBusiness Fuel prices: Rising costs and panic-buying hitting NI hauliers By The NewsroomPeople Visitors will take a step back in time into s Belfast Gemma MurrayCrime Man charged with murder of Martin Gavin in north Belfast By The Newsroom Traffic and Travel Man dies on Ben Nevis as mountain teams rescue  stranded people By The NewsroomNews Watch amazing images as Shackleton’s lost ship Endurance is found in Antarctic PA ReporterCrime Heartfelt tributes paid to murdered PSNI officer Stephen Carroll on anniversary Gemma Murray, founder of Woodstock in west Belfast and SDLP MLA Justin McNully offloading donations given by people from Co.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Most of the land is currently vacant.A pedestrian footbridge over the Cardf Bay Link road would connect to the proposed new arena development, which is likely to get planning permission on Wednesday, March .Cllr Russell Goodway, cabinet member for investment and development, said: “One of the ways in which we will ensure that a signicant amount of the pedestrians leaving the arena on an event day doesn’t go past residential properties iswe can get that additional station on Pierhead Street.“Because then people would be able to walk out of the arena, across the public square, and then over a new bridge which will take them to that station and then off to the east of Cardf.”He was addressing the council’s cabinet on Thursday, March , about the wider regeneration plans across Cardf Bay. These include turning Lloyd George Avenue into a linear park and upgrading the cycling lanes there, building a velodrome at the International Sports Village, building a new lido near Techniquest, and hosting events at Alexandra Head.As well as building a ,-capacity arena, the wider redevelopment of Atlantic Wharf would also see the Travelodge hotel and Red Dragon Centre relocated, new museums, a multi-storey car park, hotels, apartments, a new tourist attraction, and a public square. Most of this would be built where the Red Dragon Centre, County Hall and car parks currently are.But some concerns already raised by local residents include the noise of bands playing at the arena, and thousands of people leaving after a concert late at night. Having a new metro station at Pierhead Street could ert those people away from houses and flats nearby..removeTransport for Wales is due to start working on the railway along Lloyd George Avenue this August, electrying the track. The current route to Cardf Bay only stops at Queen Street station, and not Central station, but could soon be upgraded to stop there too. Another new station could also be built at Loudon Square.A recent cabinet report said: “The initial phase of the Cardf Bayproject is due to start on site in August , and the plans to link the new line into Cardf Central and onto a new station at Roath Basin are moving rapidly through the design phases.“The council is working with the Welsh Government to extend the current investment in the Core Valley Lines extension, to provide a direct link to Cardf Central station and to extend the line further into Cardf Bay, connecting to a proposed new transport hub at Pierhead Street, and onto a new station at Roath Basin.“This would essentially form the first phase of the council’s Crossrail project. Positive discussions have taken place and remain ongoing with the owner of the Pierhead Street site, which has been identied as the preferred location for the new Cardf Bay transport hub.“Later phases of the council’s Crossrail project will see new stations delivered at Splott, Tremorfa, Newport Road and then onto the proposed new Cardf Parkway mainline station, providing the first public transport rail infrastructure for the east of Cardf.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAlbrighton put the Foxes ahead on the half-hour mark by cracking the ball home from the edge of the box following a burst down the left and tee up by Harvey Barnes.The -year-old also provided the assist in stoppage time when substitute Kelechi Iheanacho curled in to ensure Leicester secured a two-goal lead to take into next Thursday’s second leg in France.Boss Rodgers, whose side have now won each of their last four games in all competitions, said of Albrighton: “He’s an invaluable member of the squad, someone who turns up every day, trains, gives his all. When he plays he gives everything.“To score a goal, create a goal, work as hard as he did, he had a great night. He’s been a big player for us coming into the team.“What’s allowed us to get our win rate up has been work rate, and that work rate from players like him is so important.“How you press the game at the top end of the field, make it really dficult, that’s been the real foundation of our work, and he epitomises all of that. He’s been absolutely brilliant, and it was a great night for him.”Giving his overall assessment, Rodgers said: “I think you can see Rennes are a very good side. They made a better start, were quicker to the ball, and we were giving it away too cheaply.“But we worked our way into the game, and I think once we got the first goal, which was an outstanding goal, then it gave us real confidence in the game. Collectively we worked very hard, and we scored two outstanding goals.“Thegoal was a fabulous goal. Barnes’ touch was sensational, then he beat the full-back, got into the box, pulled it back and then Marc, what a finish that was. It just was such a great, great goal, and a wonderful finish.”Rodgers added: “- for me is a scoreline of endurance. It’s still you have to endure and suffer, because the opponent has nothing to lose, they can come after you. So we know we’ll be under pressure in the second leg, but we also know we can score goals..remove“You couldn’t be happier really with a first leg, but it’s only half-time.”Rennes failed to make the most of some notable chances, and were thwarted by Kasper Schmeichel with just over  minutes to go to when he made a good save to keep out a Martin Terrier shot.Rennes boss Bruno Genesio said: “I think we did lots of good things during the game. Technically we were good and we created chances.“But I think in football you have to be clinical at one end and score your chances and also very efficient at the other end, and more than anything  I regret the fact we conceded the second goal towards the end.“Sometimes you can make errors or mistakes, but I think tonight our game management at the end, there were a couple of times when we could have maintained possession of the ball, we gave the ball away and then we ended up conceding that goal.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Brendan Rodgers hails impact of Leicester winger Marc Albrighton article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
