Rusty said Angel saw the post and said: \u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027           In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Rusty Updegraff claims the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would leave town for ten days at a time and not call her children. He says seeing the emotional impact her behavior was having on Angel and even Phoenix, 19, spurred him to actJudge Mark Juhas imposed the strict regulations while he works out what to do over long term custody with her ex Belafonte.The order says Mel can, \u0027hire an acceptable nanny from a registered and bonded agency\u0027 to satisfy the requirement, but there must be someone \u0027present\u0027 so that the star is not left alone with her child unsupervised.Restaurateur Rusty says he is pleased with the outcome and it was never his intention to push for Mel to lose custody of her children.\u0027I did the job, you know, because it\u0027s about the kids, not about her,\u0027 he said.\u0027Those girls love their mom and Melanie loves the girls, but Melanie desperately needs help.\u0027I want her to be clean and healthy, because when she\u0027s healthy she can be a mom again. Right now she\u0027s the world\u0027s worst mom.\u0027Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot.And during the shouting matches the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would often hit out at sports mad Angel calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant.He recalls: \u0027Angel\u0027s a tomboy, she doesn\u0027t like to shower, she\u0027s at that age, so Mel nicknames her smelly b***h, she\u0027s like, \u0027you want to be a smelly b***h? Everybody will call you smelly b***h\u0027 and she\u0027d just keep going.\u0027I pleaded with her, \u0027\u0027please don\u0027t say that to your daughter\u0027\u0027. She responded: \u0027\u0027Why? She is a smelly b***h… she stinks.\u0027\u0027\u0027Angel is 11 years old, that\u0027s going to stay with her, I know because my dad was like that...it just creates these insecurities in children as they get older.\u0027    Rusty claims that the singer cruelly bullied her 11-year-old daughter Angel (pictured together), calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant          Updegraff filed the bombshell deposition in regards to the America\u0027s Got Talent judge after witnessing her behavior while he was looking after her young children for nine months          Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot. Pictured: Mel B with Angel (left), Madison (center) and Phoenix, 19, (right) on Mother\u0027s Day           Updegraff shared texts messages he received from Mel B\u0027s best friend Charlotte, who tried to stage an intervention with the singer, which lists her numerous partners          The screenshots Updegraff provided also reveal an enormous tower of tequila boxes stockpiled in Mel B\u0027s homeOn another occasion one of the star\u0027s Instagram posts got the attention of Angel.Mel posed naked with hairdresser and BFF Gary Madatyan, who was also naked, in a swimming pool and posted the provocative photos on her social media feed.Rusty, 60, recalls the shocking moment Mel\u0027s daughter spotted the post.\u0027We were in Palm Springs and Mel had been drinking. I was on my last nerve and Mel had been on a roll in LA before she even went to Palm Springs.\u0027Then Angel saw an Instagram post of Melanie naked with Gary her hairdresser and she\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027\u0027\u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad.\u0027Angel was embarrassed that Mommy had done this. Mel\u0027s kids are seeing her Instagram, Angel is 11 but her mind isn\u0027t developed, it\u0027s truly sad.\u0027And in more concerning behavior Rusty says Mel would regularly go away from home on work trips for seven or ten days at a time but she never once called her children to check they were okay.\u0027I mean, who does that,\u0027 said Rusty.Rusty says he was spending so much time with the two girls that he quickly became \u0027attached\u0027 and found caring for them \u0027so rewarding\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re so funny and so interesting, they ask a million questions, they\u0027re great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Madison is, I swear to God, she\u0027s a TV personality and she doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s funny.Warring Mel B and Stephen Belafonte slash $1.5m off the...EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is ordered to submit random drug and...Mel B accused by her male nanny of cocaine binges, drinking...Share this article    He continued: \u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad\u0027           Updegraff said he thought Madison (pictured with Mel at a filming of America\u0027s Got Talent) was about to be molested by one of her male friends, as the man allegedly tried to take the little girl into the shower to \u0027clean\u0027 her \u0027And Angel, brilliant. She\u0027s kind of to herself, but a brilliant writer, artist and creative person. She loves sports and loves to sing.\u0027One night her grandma was there, Melanie was at work and she came down, she was doing her homework and we started talking to her about it and she had written a story which was great.\u0027And she was so excited that we were reading her story that she ran upstairs and brought down a box full of stories that she\u0027s written.\u0027And this is why I think it\u0027s sad. Melanie had no clue about this until I told her. Like, how do you not know?\u0027Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior.\u0027They want to know why there\u0027s a naked man in Mommy\u0027s room or who was that guy in the kitchen with his shirt off,\u0027 he said.\u0027I tried to answer their questions as best I could.\u0027Rusty says Mel\u0027s sex life got out of control and he worried about the children being exposed to different strange men.\u0027There was like three guys in a day and I\u0027m talking five hour sessions with each one because the guy goes, you know, I talked to the guys and they\u0027re like, I can\u0027t go anymore.\u0027And then another guy would come in and another guy. There was the waiter from Soho House, the guy she ran into at the car wash, there was the piano teacher, a guy nicknamed Frenchie, another French guy, then there was the artist guy, and you have to remember they were on rotation too.\u0027There were men coming over to her house at all hours, who are virtual strangers, and they are around the children. I am worried she doesn\u0027t know these guys.\u0027          Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior          Mel and Stephen orced in December last year, but have continued to fight over custody of their two youngest children, Angel Murphy Brown (pictured left) 11, (Mel\u0027s daughter by Eddie Murphy) and Madison Belafonte          The doting dad, 43, and his youngest daughter bonding - just a few days after Belafonte was granted temporary custodyHaving been molested as a child Rusty says he knows all too well how something shocking can happen quickly.\u0027It makes me so angry hand on heart I honestly thought that Madison was potentially going to be molested by one of her man friends,\u0027 he said.\u0027He wanted to clean her in the shower after they went swimming when Mel left the house.\u0027What man thinks it is okay to take a six-year-old girl, not his child, into a shower, and I thought that is wrong.\u0027Had I not been there that day, I dread to think what would have happened.\u0027Things got so bad that Rusty claims Mel\u0027s mother Andrea, sister Danielle and best friend Charlotte flew in to LA in April to carry out an intervention due to her excessive drinking.Unfortunately the action didn\u0027t go down too well with Brown.\u0027When they came over Mel spent one whole day ignoring them, upstairs having sex with an actor at the house, with the stereo blazing. That pushed things to the edge,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027They all had blazing rows.\u0027He continued: \u0027Mel would drink so much at the house and pass out, so if there was an emergency I dread to think what would happen with the kids.\u0027I am really concerned about those kids, who I grew very close to during my nine months.\u0027When I was there they were protected, but the kids cannot look after themselves - and Mel is not focused on them. At times I felt her vagina mattered more than the children.\u0027She left them often, without proper supervision, so something serious could\u0027ve happened.\u0027Those kids are in jeopardy and I had to act before something disastrous happened.\u0027          Rusty says he now wants Mel to seek professional and believes she needs to get rid of the \u0027enablers\u0027 who she pays to be around her  A judge ruled that Mel is to be subjected to random drug and alcohol tests for four months - after a bombshell declaration claimed she has been abusing drugs and alcohol while in the custody of her young children          Last month when Mel revealed she was heading for rehab for PTSD, she admitted she was struggling to deal with her emotions - which lead her to seek solace in booze and sex.

It said some products allegedly were off-loaded from Russian ships, which were identified in the report.A summary of the experts report obtained in early August by The Associated Press also said North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programs. And it said North Korea is violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial sanctions.          U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley accused Russia on Thursday of pressuring an independent panel of U.N. experts to alter a report on North Korea sanctionsThe Security Council initially imposed sanctions on North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and has made them tougher and tougher in response to further nuclear tests and an increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile program.Haley said earlier this year that successively tough Security Council sanctions resolutions adopted unanimously had cut off all North Korean exports, 90 percent of its trade, and disbanded its pool of workers send abroad to earn hard currency.Many diplomats and analysts credit the sanctions with helping promote the thaw in relations between North Korea and South Korea as well as the June meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at which they agreed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.But in July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused North Korea of \u0027illegally smuggling\u0027 in refined petroleum products beyond the annual quota of 500,000 barrels allowed under U.N. sanctions.U.S. documents sent to the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea and obtained by AP cited 89 instances between Jan. 1 and May 30 in which North Korean tankers likely delivered refined products \u0027illicitly procured\u0027 via transfers from other ships at sea.          Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he put a hold on its official release to all U.N. member nations \u0027because we disagree with certain elements\u0027 that he refused to discloseTrump presses ahead with plans for new 10 PER CENT China...Australia freezes through its coldest morning in 23 years as...Share this articleThe U.S. said Russia and China both informed the sanctions committee that they were supplying refined products to North Korea. China, which is North Korea\u0027s closest ally, is responsible for more than 90 percent of the isolated country\u0027s trade.Pompeo said North Korea is also evading sanctions by smuggling coal by sea and across borders, by using cyber thefts and other criminal activities, and by keeping workers in some countries that he didn\u0027t name.All these activities are \u0027generating significant revenues for the regime and they must be stopped,\u0027 he said.At the time, Haley criticized \u0027some friends who want to go around the rules,\u0027 and especially Russia and China for blocking the sanctions committee from demanding that all countries halt shipments of petroleum products to North Korea immediately.After the experts\u0027 report was released in August, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he put a hold on its official release to all U.N. member nations \u0027because we disagree with certain elements\u0027 that he refused to disclose.Russia and China then blocked the U.N. from imposing sanctions on Russia-based entities and vessels sanctioned a week earlier by the U.S. Treasury Department.The Russian news agency TASS quoted Russia\u0027s U.N. Mission as saying the proposed sanctions were \u0027unjustified.\u0027The Security Council has remained united in imposing tougher and tougher sanctions on North Korea, though the differences over the experts\u0027 report mark a serious dent in that unity.U.N. diplomats familiar with discussions said Russia was angered that the panel used a lot of U.S. intelligence in the initial report that Moscow claimed was incorrect. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because talks were private.Haley expressed disappointment in the panel \u0027for caving to Russian pressure and making changes to what should have been an independent report.\u0027 She called it \u0027a stain\u0027 on the experts\u0027 important work."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/15/11/502F9ECA00000578-0-King_Carl_Gustaf_Queen_Silvia_Crown_Princess_Victoria_prince_Dan-m-24_1537006948698.jpg","title":"Swedish royal family host gala dinner Stockholm Palace","story":"    King Carl Gustaf, Queen Silvia, Crown Princess Victoria, Prince Danieil and Prince Carl Philip greet their guests at the Swedish Royal Dinner in Stockholm          King Carl Gustaf, Queen Silvia, Crown Princess Victoria, Prince Danieil and Prince Carl Philip at the dinner in the capital Stockholm          Glamorous: (left to right) Prince Daniel, Crown Princess Victoria, King Carl Gustaf, Queen Silvia, Prince Carl Philip, Princess Sofia, before the dinner served in the Vita Havet Assembly Rooms          Chatting: Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel chat to guests at the gala dinner on Friday evening          Schmoozing: Princess Sofia, who gave birth to son Prince Alexander last month, with husband Prince Carl Philip mingle with guests.

British accountant Arron Kilburn, 31, has his customers stay in this £500-a-weekend villaMr Miller’s parents warned against taking ayahuasca and the coroner at his inquest, Maria Voisin, said she would write to the Foreign Office urging extra guidance to those visiting areas where the drug is prevalent.Experts have also warned that ayahuasca, which contains a dangerous LSD-like substance called dimethyltryptamine, can increase blood pressure and cause severe psychological distress and hallucinations.In 2015, Unais Gomes, 26, a Cambridge graduate and former Goldman Sachs banker, died after taking ayahuasca.

Henry Miller, from Bristol, died while high on the substance during a ritual in Colombia in 2014Mr Kilburn highlights none of the drug’s dangers in the company’s promotional material but in a slick video shot at the villa, he declares: ‘Many people contact us and feel very anxious about coming.‘I’d encourage everyone to trust themselves and follow their heart. There’s a quote that I really like which is, “The greatest treasure is found in the cave that we are afraid to enter.” ’Mr Kilburn, who runs an accountancy firm called AK Finance Systems Ltd, describes himself as an ‘ayahuasca integrator’ on his Facebook page and has spoken at several conferences to promote the drug.An advert on Facebook says ayahuasca ‘allows us to go deeply inside our own consciousness – to see the limiting beliefs and patterns that we hold, and to let them go in order to realise our true potential. Many believe that ayahuasca itself has now decided to make the change and expand across the globe.’Last night, a spokesman for Inner Mastery International, the parent company of Ayahuasca English, said: ‘Ayahuasca is only an optional tool that we use to go deeper therapeutically into our participants’ emotions and hidden traumas, and given in very measured dosages.‘We have a medical team to advise our participants and team members before any person signs up.

It said some products allegedly were off-loaded from Russian ships, which were identified in the report.A summary of the experts report obtained in early August by The Associated Press also said North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programs. And it said North Korea is violating sanctions by transferring coal at sea and flouting an arms embargo and financial sanctions.          U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley accused Russia on Thursday of pressuring an independent panel of U.N. experts to alter a report on North Korea sanctionsThe Security Council initially imposed sanctions on North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and has made them tougher and tougher in response to further nuclear tests and an increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile program.Haley said earlier this year that successively tough Security Council sanctions resolutions adopted unanimously had cut off all North Korean exports, 90 percent of its trade, and disbanded its pool of workers send abroad to earn hard currency.Many diplomats and analysts credit the sanctions with helping promote the thaw in relations between North Korea and South Korea as well as the June meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at which they agreed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.But in July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused North Korea of \u0027illegally smuggling\u0027 in refined petroleum products beyond the annual quota of 500,000 barrels allowed under U.N. sanctions.U.S. documents sent to the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea and obtained by AP cited 89 instances between Jan. 1 and May 30 in which North Korean tankers likely delivered refined products \u0027illicitly procured\u0027 via transfers from other ships at sea.

Here are 10 of the most mind-meltingly, brain-bogglingly, heart-stoppingly creative records to have ever been nominatedPrimal Scream (1991) For the two albums that came before Screamadelica, Primal Scream were just another fey and jangly Scottish indie band. Enter DJ and producer Andrew Weatherall, who harnessed Bobby Gillespie and co’s interest in London’s buzzing late-80s acid house scene and helped turn it into a euphoric, hedonistic and era-defining record. Loaded is the hit, Slip Inside This House the inspired cover version and Don’t Fight It, Feel It the definitive instruction on how to do ecstasy-inspired raving properly.Spice Girls (1996)A short list of people who grew up listening to the Spice Girls: Little Mix, Charli XCX, Katy Perry, Adele. And Spice was the wildly enthusiastic in-yer-face dance-pop record that – thanks to enormohits Wannabe, Say You’ll Be There and Who Do You Think You Are – launched Ginger, Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and the “girl power” slogan into the mainstream quicker than you could say “zig-a-zig-ah”.Massive Attack (1998) Deep, dark, doomy and graceful, Mezzanine is trip-hop’s crowning glory. Teardrop is the most famous track, but Inertia Creeps, Risingson and Angel are just as harrowingly atmospheric. Made at a time when the mood within the Bristol band was terse, Massive Attack’s third album pongs of alienation, isolation and fear, and the trio became a duo shortly after the release when Andrew Vowles, aka Mushroom, jumped ship (or was pushed off).The Streets (2002) On which 23-year-old Birmingham boy Mike Skinner takes the sound of two-step UK garage and decorates it with often funny, frequently poignant and always relatable raps about, as he puts it on Has It Come to This?, a “day in the life of a geezer”. Booze, drugs, clubs, pubs, PlayStations, heartbreak, the quantity of fried tomato a fry-up requires – it’s all on there, still sounding fresh. Put on your classics and have a little dance. Dizzee Rascal (2003)Until the release of Skepta’s Konnichiwa in 2016, Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in Da Corner was the grime album. Released when the genre was still relatively young, it’s a frighteningly raw and angry take on the realities of growing up as a working-class kid in east London. Looking at the artist Dizzee has become, it’s hard to remember the shy teenager who raps so furiously about knife crime (Stop Dat), underage sex (I Luv U) and everyday violence (Seems 2 Be) over ice-cold beats that reflect the hopelessness of his situation. But he’s there, and he’s a genius.MIA (2005) There’s a lot to get your head round on the debut album from the London via Sri Lanka rapper. The title: MIA’s dad’s codename when he was in the Tamil Tiger militant group, given to the record in the hope he would one day Google himself and see what his daughter had made (he did). The sound: multicultural trans-global party music that nicks bits from all over the world, most notably hip-hop and dancehall. The lyrics: explorations of politics, culture, food, sex, war and revolution. Truly invigorating.The xx (2009)Listen to this debut album now, and you might think you’ve heard it all before. But none of London Grammar, Banks, Alt-J, Lorde or James Blake sounded like that before xx. Really, the only band that sounded remotely like the xx before the xx were late-70s Welsh post-punks Young Marble Giants. But the genius of the London band’s update on YMG’s minimal guitar sound is the use of cutting-edge production to create 11 spooky mini-epics that tell late-night tales of love, lust and longing.PJ Harvey (2011)From the moment she announced Let England Shake on the Andrew Marr Show in April 2010, telling the presenter: “My biggest fear would be to replicate something I’ve done before”, you knew Polly Jean Harvey’s eighth album would be special. Suspicions were confirmed when, 10 months later, an ambitious portrayal of the horrors of world war one and its aftermath appeared, featuring lyrics about soldiers falling “like lumps of meat” (The Words That Maketh Murder) and a country whose “fruit is deformed children” (The Glorious Land) in songs that took in folk, rock and pop, mostly made with guitars but with dashes of harp and sax in there too. PJ wasn’t done there though, and asked war photographer Seamus Murphy to make a video for every track to complete a fantastically creative vision.FKA Twigs (2014)Four years since Tahlia Barnett released her debut album, there’s still nothing quite like it. In a way it’s doomy alt-R\u0026ampB but just like, say, Bjork in her pomp, there are so many risks, ideas and moods on LP1 it would be unfair to label it. There are sad songs (Pendulum), sexy songs (Two Weeks), romantic songs (Hours) and vulnerable songs (Closer), a mega list of producers (Clams Casino, Sampha, Twigs herself and more) and a whole load of vocal experimentation. Yet it comes together because FKA Twigs, alien pop star extraordinaire, is right at the heart of all of it.J Hus (2017) The way J Hus’s debut brings together grime, garage, bashment, dancehall, afrobeat and early 00s hip-hop is as exciting as British music gets. Tunes like Bouff Daddy, Did You See and the title track are carnivals of ideas, and the east Londoner is comfortable rapping sensitively, playfully or aggressively over any style he’s given. The focus, though, is always on his extraordinary life that’s featured a multiple stabbing. It’s the unique sound of modern multicultural London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de304c9478179b4567ea98cc79d7ba3078956e25/0_0_3043_2362/master/3043.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=afa89355811f99f3f13222326f8c2936 1400w","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Daily life in Pyongyang, Hurricane Florence, protests in Gaza and Serena Williams at the US Open in New York – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf727e5295539d51342c660304b1d9b7ae5805ac/0_748_1844_1106/master/1844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ed3eb767f78c93cd6e228bff1f67874","title":"matilda at 30 roald dahl quentin blake","story":"To mark three decades since Roald Dahl’s heroine first appeared, her illustrator, Quentin Blake, has imagined her life nowShe was the quintessential young rebel who broke all the rules about how good little girls should be portrayed in children’s literature by standing up to bullies in the name of justice – and having a laugh at the same time.Now, Roald Dahl’s Matilda – the most powerful female genius ever to be underestimated by a hammer-throwing headmistress – has been portrayed for the first time as a 30-year-old woman in a series of eight sketches by Dahl’s long-time illustrator and friend Quentin Blake.To mark the 30th anniversary of the first publication of the book, three of these sketches will appear next month on the covers of special collectors’ editions, showing Matilda variously as an astrophysicist, a world traveller and as chief executive of the British Library. “Oh good,” Dr Matilda Wormwood is pictured thinking as a male library assistant brings her a huge pile of books: “Here’s one I haven’t read.”In his foreword to the new editions, Blake, 85, reveals he enjoyed imagining what Matilda might be doing now she has grown up. “Since, as a small child, Matilda was gifted in several ways, it wasn’t very difficult. I imagined that for each version of our grown-up Matilda one of her extraordinary talents and achievements would have come to the fore and shown her a role in life,” he writes.“I am sure that someone who had read so many books when she was small could easily have become chief executive of the British Library, or someone exceptionally gifted at mental arithmetic would be perfectly at home in astrophysics. And if you have been to so many countries in books, what could be more natural than to go and see them yourself?”Blake describes illustrating Matilda as a wonderful experience. “It has been very special to revisit her all these years later and marvel at the woman she would have become.”Matilda has been one of Dahl’s bestselling books since it was published in 1988, with 17 million copies sold worldwide, but sales have particularly spiked in the past two years and it is now outselling all of Dahl’s other titles.Carmen McCullough, Roald Dahl editor at Matilda’s publisher, Puffin, believes this reflects a wider trend in children’s fiction: “We’ve seen a real movement towards more feminist publishing recently. Parents are more keen than ever to present aspirational female characters to their young children – boys and girls – and that is what’s helping Matilda stand out, because she’s a wonderful example. She has such belief in herself and is every bit as relevant and inspirational to children and adults today as she was 30 years ago.”Children’s laureate Lauren Child agrees part of Matilda’s enduring universal appeal is that Dahl chose to write about a spirited little girl. “Like Jo in Little Women and Pippi Longstocking, Matilda is an incredibly modern character. You can relate to her. She’s not a sap, she’s not a goody two-shoes, she doesn’t take everything sitting down, she fights back. She’s for justice.”Children’s fiction continues to be dominated by male characters because publishers wrongly think boys don’t like to read books about heroines, she says – and this continues to make Matilda appear fresh and relevant. “We are surprised by Matilda because there aren’t many modern female characters like her. We shouldn’t be, but we still are because times haven’t quite changed enough.”The success of Matilda the Musical, which has been seen by 8 million people in 65 cities around the world, has helped to reignite interest in the story among adults.The book’s publishers hope millennials who enjoyed reading Matilda as children will purchase (or be given) the 30th anniversary edition in order to read the story again as adults, choosing the cover which most suits their own view of what Matilda would be like at 30.Child, the author and illustrator of the Charlie and Lola picture books, believes Matilda would have become an inventor. “I think she would be a very creative person at 30. The way she thinks is interesting. She thinks in a sideways way, a way that’s out of a box. She’s not confined. But the thing that you feel most about her is that she could be anything. I think that’s the message of the book: You can’t beat someone down if they’re interested in the world and they have a good heart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d87f461b93a33a9d5b7326b74a56736864fcfed/8_16_3096_1858/master/3096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a893b599d503c3dfee863375322eb0a","title":"an economic recovery based around high debt is really no recovery lehman","story":"Ten years after the Lehman collapse the necessary reforms to a flawed model have not taken placeAs a profession, economists are absolutely hopeless at forecasting recessions. That is true not only in the years before a severe downturn. It happens when the storm is about to break. Back in 2008, the Bank of England failed to predict the biggest postwar slump in the UK’s history even after it had started.This less than impressive record should act as a cautionary note in the current circumstances when the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers has generated a thriving cottage industry devoted to predicting when the next crisis will occur. The honest answer is that nobody really knows. Meteorology has improved in the past 40 years: economic forecasting has not. When a weather forecaster says a hurricane is imminent, the public does well to take notice. When an economic forecaster gives a similar warning, the chances are that it is already too late.This might be about to change. Just as satellite technology has made weather forecasting far more accurate, so machine-learning algorithms could bring economic forecasting into the 21st Century.Rickard Nyman and Paul Ormerod have compared economic forecasting by humans and machines in both the US and the UK, and come up with some stark conclusions. At the start of 2008 the survey of professional forecasters in the US failed to predict that within a year their country would be in a deep recession. Had US policy makers relied on machine-learning algorithms they would have been much better prepared for the trouble ahead. Even more impressive results using machine learning were obtained for the UK.There’s more, however. Nyman and Ormerod sift through all the economic and financial variables that might have been responsible for causing the downturn and come up with a conclusion that explodes the myth that overspending governments were to blame.“The evidence suggests quite clearly that public sector debt played no causal role in generating the Great Recession” they say. “In contrast, the ratio of private sector debt to GDP does appear to have played a significant role, especially in the UK.”In truth, the idea that state profligacy caused the Great Recession has never been credible. What really happened was that the expansion of the global marketplace led to cheap goods flooding the west. Inflationary pressure abated and that persuaded central banks to cut interest rates. Financial deregulation meant the only remaining constraint on excessive borrowing – high interest rates – was removed – and so credit was cheap and readily available. The private sector loaded up on debt, which was fine so long as the assets on the other side of the balance sheet were going up in value. When the markets turned, things went pear-shaped very quickly.Only at that point, did public sector debt become a problem because governments sought to ameliorate the impact of the recession by cutting taxes and increasing spending. The debts incurred by the private sector were, to an extent, nationalised.Bill White, then chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements was one of the very few who sought to prick the bubble of complacency in the boom years, making the point that periods of low inflation could still end in crisis. His warnings were not heeded.The BIS remains concerned about debt levels, which is where the work of Nyman and Ormerod is relevant to the state of the world 10 years after Lehman.The BIS says in its latest annual report that there are already material risks to financial stability. “In some respects, the risks mirror the unbalanced post-crisis recovery and its excessive reliance on monetary policy. Where financial vulnerabilities exist, they have been building up, in their usual gradual and persistent way. More generally, financial markets are overstretched … and we have seen a continuous rise in the global stock of debt, private plus public, in relation to GDP. This has extended a trend that goes back to well before the crisis and that has coincided with a long-term decline in interest rates.Behind the dry official language, the message is clear. A recovery that is based around high and rising levels of debt is really no recovery at all. The world economy is, in all material respects, the same as it was in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. The necessary reforms to a flawed model have not taken place, which is why the BIS warning should not be ignored.While it is not possible to say when the next recession will arrive, or where it will start, history is repeating itself. And you don’t need a machine learning-algorithm to know there are dangers involved in that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/919a46ffb0fcb977338bf136e6bce03d9db51cd0/1038_1473_4713_2828/master/4713.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0d61914ab362c70d0b13d31a6b8a0ee","title":"what walking the city week how involved","story":" Cities wants to hear your experiences of urban walking – good and bad.

I’m sure I speak for most of the country when I say it feels like we’ve been talking about Brexit for far longer.It’s no secret I campaigned for the UK to remain and I’ve said all along that any form of Brexit – no matter how hard or soft – would result in fewer jobs, less prosperity and a reduced role for Britain on the world stage. The evidence for this is irrefutable.However, the will of the British people was to leave the EU. I respect that and wanted us to make the best of the situation. That’s why, since the referendum, I’ve given the government my support where appropriate as they’ve tried to negotiate with the EU. It’s why, despite our many differences, I’ve worked closely with the Brexit secretary and other cabinet members to push for the best possible deal.In good faith, I’ve given the government every bit of advice and information available to City Hall and every opportunity to strike a deal that would minimise the impact on people’s livelihoods. But I’ve become increasingly alarmed as the chaotic approach to the negotiations has become mired in confusion and deadlock, leading us down a path that could be hugely damaging – not only to London, but the whole country.The unfortunate reality is that Theresa May has failed to negotiate a Brexit position with her own party – let alone agree a deal with the EU. At every stage, her government has looked unprepared and out of its depth, resulting in a litany of wrong turns. And, not for the first time, it seems the debate has become more about Boris Johnson’s political ambitions than what’s good for the country.Until now, I’ve held out hope the government would finally get its act together, start listening to the advice of employers, trade unions and everyone who has a stake in getting this right and seek the best possible deal with the EU – putting the national interest ahead of narrow party politics. But it’s clear this prospect is now dead in the water.With time rapidly running out, we are left with two possibilities – a bad deal, which could end up being so vague that we leave the EU blind to what our future relationship will be, or a “no-deal” Brexit.Both these scenarios are a million miles from what was promised during the referendum campaign, only further exposing the lies and mistruths sold to the public. They are also both incredibly risky and I don’t believe May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the economy and people’s livelihoods.Terrifyingly, we are now in real danger of crashing out of the EU with no deal. Despite the fanciful assurances from Johnson, this would be by far the worst outcome – with independent research showing that it could potentially result in 500,000 fewer jobs across Britain by 2030. These are real jobs and people’s living standards being put at risk.So, after a lot of careful consideration, I’ve decided the people must get a final say. This means a public vote on any deal or a vote on a no-deal, alongside the option of staying in the EU.As mayor, I wouldn’t be doing my job standing up for Londoners if I didn’t say now that it’s time to think again about how we take this crucial decision.I don’t believe it’s the will of the people to face either a bad deal or, worse, no deal. That wasn’t on the table during the campaign. People didn’t vote to leave the EU to make themselves poorer, to watch their businesses suffer, to have NHS wards understaffed, to see the police preparing for civil unrest or for national security to be put at risk if our co-operation with the EU in the fight against terrorism is weakened.It’s time to take this crucial issue out of the hands of the politicians and return it to the peopleso that they can take back control. Another public vote on Brexit was never inevitable, or something I ever thought I’d have to call for. But the government’s abject failure – and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a “no deal” Brexit – means that giving people a fresh say is now the right – and only – approach left for our country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/767490c49909fd1f7b18dd58315f1e6773b4a51c/0_282_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb4c5f31b7a7c7eb199acb69d870ab4d","title":"hatton garden and timeless allure of the artful dodger","story":"Blame Dickens for Oliver Twist.

Or whatever strolling balladeer came up with the first lyrics about Robin Hood.It was them, guv! They got us to feel a sneaking sympathy for all those artful dodgers who broke the laws and almost got away with it.This weekend, two films based on real-life attempts to steal millions of pounds of valuables are in cinemas across the country. King of Thieves covers the tale of the Hatton Garden burglary, in which £14m of jewels, gold and money was stolen by a bunch of mainly elderly career criminals over the Easter weekend in 2015. American Animals explores the botched robbery of valuable books by a quartet of students in Kentucky in 2004. Coming down the line shortly will be Widows, directed by Steve McQueen and based on Lynda La Plante’s tale of the women who carry out the crime their late husbands had been planning. And doubtless Oceans 18, 19 and 20 and a half are already being scripted.In these two films – as in real life – the perpetrators get caught and go straight to jail. One of the Hatton Garden crew died in his Belmarsh cell in February and another suffered two strokes in jail. Crime doesn’t pay! But the fact that those films and others like it are made at all has raised the question as to why we are so fascinated by – and sometimes forgiving of – those who take other people’s stuff and whether such films “glamorise” crime.The main criticisms of King of Thieves for portraying the burglars as “lovable rogues” came, understandably enough, from people in the jewellery trade in response to the trailer of the film. But the bleak reality, spelled out in some detail in both films, is that the thieves fell out, got nicked and ended up behind bars.This may seem like a technical point, but Hatton Garden was a burglary, not a robbery. A robbery is where force or the threat of it is used against a person, while a burglary is where a property is entered illegally. In one of France’s most notorious crimes, the theft of millions of francs worth of gold and cash from the vaults of the Nice branch of the Société Générale in 1976, the burglars left a cheeky note for the police: “Sans arme, ni haine, ni violence” (without weapon, without hate, without violence).The Hatton Garden burglars left no note but they did make the decision, wisely perhaps in light of the state of their knees and hips, that they would carry out the crime over an Easter weekend when there would be no one around but a passing fox and there would be no weapons. As the characters note in the film, which was partly based on a  article I wrote, the difference between a sentence for a burglary and a robbery is many years, which is of some importance if you don’t have many left. Had a guard been coshed or a passerby threatened, there would probably have been no film.We live in a world in which some chaps pocket millions in bonuses for simply doing their job and others squirrel away unearned dosh in money laundries around the world, as Oliver Bullough explains in his new book, Moneyland: Why Thieves and Crooks Now Rule the World. So there is perhaps a feeling that the people who carry out an actual burglary in which no one is physically hurt are at least taking the risks that the kleptocrats, City whizzes and corporate tax-dodgers would not.Between courts one and two in the Old Bailey, where robbers and burglars often end up, is a statue of the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry and beneath it a poetic tribute to the “one who never turned her back” by Robert Browning. Perhaps another Browning quote is worth recalling, from Bishop Blougram’s Apology: “Our interest’s on the dangerous edge of things. The honest thief, the tender murderer, the superstitious atheist.” Smart criminals now involve themselves in the much less filmic activities of cybercrime and don’t spend holiday weekends drilling their way into a vault. In the meantime, rightly or wrongly, our interest in the dangerous edge of things will ensure that the tales of artful or – more likely – artless dodgers will appear on our screens as long as films are made.Duncan Campbell is a former crime correspondent of the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7622acc7c4c7e08695206c7ab2f17bc07573aaf1/0_0_1509_905/master/1509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8638a1c91b25f3830f220d17b9123235","title":"observer view on giving voters chance to deliver verdict brexit terms","story":"Britain stands on the brink of a momentous decision. Under what terms should we leave the EU, to which we have been intimately bound – economically, culturally, socially – for the past 45 years? Yet, extraordinarily, our politicians are no closer to reaching a consensus on a satisfactory form of leaving the EU than they were in 2016, when we voted for Brexit in that fateful referendum. Fearful of the electoral consequences, neither party has been prepared to present us with the painful dimensions of that decision, preferring, instead, to pretend that Brexit requires no hard choices.This leaves the country in a dangerous political vacuum. Two years on, it will only be resolved by putting a concrete proposal to leave the EU to a popular vote, as the Observer argued 18 months ago. But both parties have failed to back a referendum, claiming that leaving the EU – however we do it and regardless of the cost – represents the unchallengeable will of the people.It’s time to call this out once and for all. By itself, the 2016 referendum did not afford sufficient democratic legitimacy for taking Britain out of the EU, come what may and however bad the terms. Voters were not presented with a clearly articulated option for leaving. The poll followed a campaign in which voters were told that leaving would be a pain-free way to “take back control” of our borders to enrich ourselves by seizing economic independence, while freeing up billions to pump into the NHS. Brexiters acknowledged no costs or risks to the painstakingly negotiated peace in Northern Ireland. True populists that they are, they mis-sold voters a disingenuous delusion. And lo and behold, they have failed to deliver. But Theresa May, the circumspect Remainer who embraced the referendum result as her path to No 10, also has much to answer for. The referendum gave her a mandate to negotiate the best possible exit terms and bring them back for approval. It was not a blank cheque for her to take Britain out of Europe on any terms, regardless of the price. Yet a blank cheque is what she has sought. She has ridden roughshod over parliament. It was only given a vote on triggering the article 50 process setting in train our departure because Gina Miller took the government to court it will only get a vote on the final deal because Tory MPs rebelled against her.The Observer is the world\u0027s oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by  News \u0026amp Media and is editorially independent.But the parliamentary vote on offer does not provide sufficient scrutiny for the biggest decision Britain has faced in decades. MPs will only get a vote for or against the deal. If they vote against, Britain will crash out. That forces their hands: reasonable parliamentarians will be obliged to vote for the deal in order to avoid a disaster. To make things worse, both main parties are hamstrung by internecine disputes. Neither has faced voters with the honest truth that Britain cannot leave the EU without making serious trade-offs. Both have absorbed the deceit of the Leave campaign – the idea that Britain can somehow have it all – to advance their own narrow political interests.At no point has May tried to resolve the trade-off between border control and market access that the EU insistence that we cannot cherrypick from its four single market freedoms implies. At no point has she been clear that if Britain wants to opt out of free movement of people, there will be significant costs. She has swallowed the populism of the Leave campaign as a price worth paying temporarily to neuter the threat from her party’s Eurosceptic flank. Labour has not only failed to challenge her chicanery, it has helped sustain it. It is focused on opposing the process rather than the substance of Brexit. It says it will vote against any exit deal that doesn’t provide the “exact same benefits as our current EU membership”. No such deal exists and, in pretending that it does, Labour is a worthy heir of the Leave campaign.The country is at a dangerous impasse. No political party is advocating a concrete plan that has any chance of securing agreement from the EU. Our leaders continue to pretend that voters were not deceived. Unchecked, this dishonesty will sow the seeds for popular backlash. You cannot beat the populists by aping them, a lesson that Britain’s governing classes appear to have yet to learn.What will ensue from this political stalemate? Most likely, the political declaration describing our long-term relationship with the EU that May secures alongside the withdrawal agreement will amount to a vague form of words that allows her to claim she has secured a permanent deal in Britain’s interests, but that leaves all the details to be hammered out after we have left. This would be a democratic travesty, the ultimate blank cheque for the Leavers in her party who will circle around her, looking to replace her with one of their own before the ink on the withdrawal agreement dries. And if May were unable to win the support of parliament, the risk is the UK would crash out without a deal, an outcome without majority support in parliament or the country.Labour’s proposed way forward is nonsensical. The shadow foreign secretary has said Labour would vote against any deal in order to trigger a general election and that a Labour government would seek to extend negotiations beyond March 2019. But the Fixed-term Parliaments Act makes an election unlikely: why would Tory or DUP MPs join the opposition in a vote of no confidence that is quite separate from a vote on the deal? And a general election in which Labour asks voters to believe that it could somehow negotiate a better deal than May would not deliver the clear verdict the country needs.The only way out of this democratic conundrum is for MPs to force the government to put its deal to the electorate. This is not about rerunning the referendum: it is the only way of making sense of its result. Voters must be offered the option to accept the deal or to seek to remain in the EU on our current terms. The idea that the 2016 vote is binding – that Britain has to leave the EU regardless of the lack of a realistic exit plan or of changing circumstances – is preposterous. And the circumstances have changed immeasurably. The government has not been able to secure what voters were promised in 2016. The electorate of 2016 does not somehow trump the better-informed electorate of 2018.Some have argued that there should be a no-deal third option. But there is no significant political constituency positively advocating crashing out with no deal. The hard Brexiters remain defined by what they are opposed to, rather than any concrete proposals. Even crashing out of the EU on WTO terms would require agreements already to be in place: existing EU quotas would need to be allocated between the EU and the UK and our proposals for doing this have already been blocked. Crashing out with no deal would be economically calamitous and this scenario should only be put to the public vote were May to fail to secure a deal.There are of course risks involved in holding another referendum. Perhaps the greatest is that we see a rerun of the 2016 referendum campaign, in which one side broke the law and neither campaign covered themselves in glory. Those advocating staying in the EU would need to run an altogether different campaign from the project fear of 2016, centred around a positive case for EU membership. We live in a world where the major challenges we face – climate change, microbial resistance, global tax avoidance – don’t respect national borders. International co-operation has never been more important and the EU, despite its imperfections, offers the best mechanism for that. There is no way Britain can leave the EU without undermining our sovereignty. We will either be a regulatory rule taker from the EU or, worse, from economic giants such as the US and China as a result of trade deals negotiated as a junior partner.The Leave campaign not only lied to voters. It broke the law to cheat campaign spending limits and ran a xenophobic campaign that demonised immigrants. A successor campaign would probably seek to further polarise the public, whipping up a backlash against what it would depict as a betrayal of the people. But these arguments must be taken on or the nasty brand of politics wins by default.It’s a tragedy that continued ision over Brexit will suck life from the debate about the gaping regional inequalities that helped create fertile territory for populist anti-EU sentiment in the first place. But thanks to the duplicity of the Brexiters, there is no other option. Leaving the EU will make people poorer and hit the least affluent parts of the country, already racked by eight years of unnecessary spending cuts.For two years, we have been failed by Britain’s political class on the most important question this country has faced in decades. Neither party has been prepared to level with us about what leaving the EU might cost. The Observer appeals to all MPs: it’s not too late to put the national interest first. We are being led to the brink of disaster as we prepare to leave the EU. We must be given the chance to deliver our verdict on the terms of departure. We must have a referendum on the deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118213b22af3158fab0dc3d8bea1210eac413d58/0_33_1594_956/master/1594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=454e38da2a92ad5fde6cf48c717d037b","title":"the peoples prime minister lets hear it for the queen","story":"With a leader and a Brexit plan that no one really wants, it’s time to give the whole country a liftDo you think the Queen would be a better prime minister than the prime minister? Probably not – she’s really old. It may be borderline treason to say it, but she is almost certainly too old to be prime minister and so might be even worse than the current one. Or maybe it’s borderline treason to suggest that she could be prime minister at all? After all, I think the person the prime minister is ostensibly primely ministering to is the Queen. So, if she were prime minister, she’d be ministering to herself, which sounds vaguely rude. In a way, that might also be treason. And is constitutionally unsound. At her age.So it’s not a workable idea, but I like its narrative arc. The Queen rolling her sleeves up (or having them rolled up by a footman) (or maybe an armperson) and saying: “Looks like we’re going to have to do this the old-fashioned way!” Just like after Henry VIII executed Thomas Cromwell.Not that she should cut Theresa May’s head off. I wouldn’t approve of that. Although, I must admit, I can imagine it. You know what I mean? She’s got that “walking out to the scaffold” look at the moment. I think she could really carry it off, which is not something you could say about most prime ministers. David Cameron’s face would look ridiculous if his head were chopped off, like a sort of pink grinning basketball Blair would still look smug John Major would be unrecognisable without the glasses. There’s no doubt about it, in this regard Theresa May’s right up there with Alec Douglas-Home.Nevertheless, let’s not execute anybody – that’s not the Queen’s style. She’s tough but fair. She’s quiet but old. Her first prime minister was Winston Churchill and her last can be herself! She can do Brexit and dance with Trump and go horse riding with Putin and have all the books about Diana publicly burned or something – probably not that, I don’t know, I’m just brainstorming. But I think it’s really interesting and has an appropriate pre-apocalyptic feel and, most importantly of all, involves a major celebrity (by which I mean the Queen), which would really capture the public’s imagination.I mean, it’s what Strictly needs. Urgently. Get the Queen on Strictly, problem solved – doesn’t matter that otherwise it’s just hurdlers and weathermen. Or was that last year? Anyway, if you’ve got the Queen, everyone’s watching. Simon Cowell would probably kill himself. But then Craig says her samba isn’t sexy enough, or her arms waggled wrong, and everyone’s upset.So, stick to prime minister, I reckon. It’s what the producers of The Crown are crying out for. Some sort of real-life Bond-film climax, ready for season 20. And no one could argue with it. It wouldn’t be like they’d brought back Princess Margaret as a robot or anything. It would have actually happened, as though Princess Margaret had really come back as a robot and they simply dramatised it. You can’t argue with history. You can’t say history jumped the shark. Even post-Trump. But personally, I don’t think the Queen, even if she were also prime minister, would actually bring back Princess Margaret as a robot. I think that’s idle speculation. There’s no way Netflix is getting that lucky.The reason I’m ruminating on who might replace Theresa May is that the Tories are doing it and they were the ones who wanted her to be prime minister in the first place. No one else did. And now even they don’t. Superb. Last week, it was\u0026nbspreported that the European Research Group, which\u0026nbspsounds nicer than it is because in reality it’s a bunch of Tory MPs who hate Europe (and probably aren’t that keen on research or groups either, come to think of it), were openly talking about how and when to get rid of her.You can imagine it: there they are, all crossly talking about how wrong they recently were and so how important it is that we now do exactly what they think. Which is probably to have a government led by Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg or one of the other monstrously bad men they hang out with. Well, I prefer the Queen to that lot and I’d like to hear Jacob Rees-Mogg stand up and explain why he’d make a better prime minister than the Queen or the pope or Jesus or any of the people he’s at various times pretended he’s more into than himself.What an odd situation we’re in. We’ve got a prime minister that hardly anybody wants – a year or so ago a minority thought “she’ll do for now”, but that was pretty much her popularity zenith – trying to push through a plan that absolutely nobody wants. I think that’s true, isn’t it? That nobody wants it, this “Chequers plan”? It’s a form of Brexit, so all the people who voted against Brexit (such as Theresa May) don’t want it. But it’s apparently a feebly soft Brexit – “economic vassalage”, according to Johnson – so all of the people who want Brexit don’t want it. And also the EU, which doesn’t want Brexit and hasn’t agreed to the Chequers plan, doesn’t want it.So what are its advantages? Well, it’s not the option that anyone dreads most, I suppose. We can’t agree on what course of action is worse than the Chequers plan, but we can all agree that a worse one exists. A consensus is forming around what the second worst thing to do is and so we’ll do that.Of course, Theresa May herself, for all the stress she’s going through, is probably broadly pleased that she’s still prime minister. But she may be in a minority of one (or two – her husband’s pretty supportive). That seems a bit unfair. If no one’s getting what they want, surely that should also include the prime minister. So the only route to justice within this catastrophe is to have a prime minister who unquestionably, undeniably, does not want the job. God bless you, ma’am."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24755184fe1077c4446c4b4f9ea2130","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

It follows evidence that students as old as 14 are being given English texts designed for primary children.In a wide-ranging interview with the Observer, Spielman said she had been driven “absolutely nuts” by evidence that some schools were assuming that disadvantaged children were “automatically low-achieving and need a watered-down curriculum”.“Children can go all the way through secondary school and then go bump when they hit real demands in post-16 education or have aspirations for university, because they just don’t have the experience or practice of reading more demanding texts. Schools can think they are being helpful by adapting and providing relevant material. But in fact it hollows out education and means that disadvantaged children don’t get the experience that they absolutely should. The job of schools is to make sure that children get the things they won’t necessarily get at home.”Spielman, who took over as chief inspector last year, warned that schooling standards would be put at risk by further cuts to Ofsted’s budget. She said the inspectorate was now at the “very limit of giving the level of assurance that we are expected to give”. It comes after Ofsted was criticised for failing to inspect some schools for up to a decade and only spending a day inspecting others.The chief inspector also warned that the schools system had “stopped acting in children’s interests” by allowing thousands of underperforming pupils to be ushered out of the door to protect their school’s exam pass rates.She said some schools were putting themselves first and students second by shuffling out underperforming pupils in a process known as “offrolling”. Ofsted found that between 2016 and 2017 more than 19,000 pupils did not progress from year 10 to year 11 in the same state-funded secondary school. Many were disappearing from schooling altogether.“It’s an example of where, to some extent, it looks as if the schools system has stopped acting in children’s interests, that schools’ interests are getting put ahead of children,” she said. “We need inspectors to know where a school is losing children at a rate that looks suspiciously high and have a tough conversation with the school where it is happening. There are about 300 where we can see that the number of children leaving between years 10 and 11 looks too high to be statistical noise.”Spielman said the practice was creating a system in which challenging pupils ended up in underperforming schools. “When you have children falling out of one school, what is the school that they will get put in if parents or local authorities are looking for another? It will be the undersubscribed school, which will typically be the school that is doing badly, often in a tough area.”She suggested the practice was adding to her concerns about children supposedly being educated at home.“We found that half of the children who come off a mainstream school roll at the end of year 10 don’t appear on the roll of any registered provision for year 11. That is a very big number disappearing. Home education generally is something I’m really concerned about. Those children disappear into the ether.“Nobody really knows what they are doing, who is taking responsibility for them. At one level parents are supposedly taking responsibility, but is that what is happening? There is a militantly independent group of homeschoolers who have existed for a very long time, who are politically quite powerful. There is a growing religious strand of people who want to protect their children’s faith and make sure that everything about the child’s education experience happens within the faith.“Sometimes that is in registered schools, but probably though it is hard to be sure - some children who are supposedly being home-educated are in fact in unregistered religious schools.”Spielman, who has faced hostility for accusing faith schools run by religious conservatives of deliberately resisting British values, said she believed some groups were deliberately finding loopholes in the rules to ensure their child’s education was not inspected.“Home education takes us into the territory of stuff that is hard to discuss that a lot of people find ‘undiscussable’,” she said. “We are trying to explore what is happening and why it brings you up against people who really do not want their children’s education scrutinised. I’m trying to make sure that we talk about the tough stuff and that we help make the tough stuff discussable, so that people don’t run away from it. It is difficult and it has to be talked about.”Spielman said there must be no return to the time when concerns about “cultural sensitivity” led some local authorities to be reluctant to intervene in cases of child sexual exploitation. Ofsted also inspects children’s services offered by local authorities.“One of the biggest failures of children’s services in recent years hasn’t been about resources, it has been about issues such as child sexual exploitation being undiscussable, because of different kinds of cultural sensitivity,” she said. “At Ofsted, it is easy to see how people slip back into being anxious not to offend communities or tread on toes. We must make sure we keep up the pressure to talk honestly about the tough stuff.”She responded to criticism of the regularity and thoroughness of Ofsted’s school inspections by warning that the inspectorate was doing everything it could to keep up school standards. “We are at the very limit of giving the level of assurance that we are expected to give on the current budget,” she said. Asked if further cuts would damage standards, she said: “I would hope that is how it is seen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a0c468ced68e486d9f327feca12caca5a3ab418/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a009a08c674cde04a8db29e3753da615","title":"cross party effort to save state maintained nursery schools","story":"A cross-party group of MPs has launched a campaign to fight cuts in funding for state-maintained nursery schools, warning that they will worsen inequality in children’s education.More than 70 MPs, including 12 Conservatives, have signed a letter to education and Treasury ministers urging them to secure the future of 400 maintained nurseries by continuing the current financial support beyond 2020. Among the signatories is Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the education select committee.Halfon told the Observer: “Maintained nurseries are some of the best examples of the state. Most have been rated outstanding by Ofsted. Why would you consider cutting funding for these schools?”One specific purposes is to close the learning gap between the most- and least-privileged children. Partly for this reason, however, the costs of running them can be higher, which is why in 2016 the government promised supplementary funding of £55m to £60m a year, but this guarantee only lasts until 2019. That figure is also one-third of the overall budget for nurseries – which will disappear if the fund is not renewed.Bryan Lee, executive headteacher for the Plymouth Nursery Schools Federation, said schools had to announce their budgets for the next three years and this would be impossible without guarantees of future funding.\u0026nbsp“We need the funding if we are to put forward our budget for the next three years,” he said. “Our schools cost more to maintain, so we absolutely need these extra funds. Without them, we would go under.”The nurseries are already operating at a deficit, and Lee said they had made cuts and restructuring efforts. He said he had even done some of the maintenance work on nursery buildings himself to keep costs down.Halfon said there was cross-party interest in fighting for the maintained nurseries. “This isn’t about Conservative or Labour politicians. If you have a passion for education and helping those who are less advantaged, supporting these education institutions, which are doing such great work, should be the number one priority. It is not even an issue specific to my constituency. I’m talking about protecting maintained nurseries generally, as a country.”Though the only strict classification is that such nurseries must have professionally qualified teachers – which does not apply to private or state nurseries – maintained schools are a historical institution dating back a century. They were originally established by the state in deprived areas so that all young children would have access to a basic education.Labour MPs who have signed the letter include Harriet Harman, the former deputy party leader, David Lammy and Lucy Powell, the former shadow education secretary ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f819dd5a6d6ccf32bb40583596a62e53777beb9a/0_391_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93cfb0f795e6f6762f7478e20f94a4a0","title":"air pollution particles found in mothers placentas","story":"New research shows direct evidence that toxic air – already strongly linked to harm in unborn babies – travels through mothers’ bodiesScientists have found the first evidence that particles of air pollution travel through pregnant women’s lungs and lodge in their placentas.Toxic air is already strongly linked to harm in foetuses but how the damage is done is unknown. The new study, involving mothers living in London, UK, revealed sooty particles in the placentas of each of their babies and researchers say it is quite possible the particles entered the foetuses too.“It is a worrying problem – there is a massive association between air pollution a mother breathes in and the effect it has on the foetus,” said Dr Lisa Miyashita, at Queen Mary University of London, one of the research team. “It is always good if possible to take less polluted routes if you are pregnant – or indeed if you are not pregnant. I avoid busy roads when I walk to the station.”Scientists are increasingly finding that air pollution results in health problems far beyond the lungs. In August, research revealed that air pollution causes a “huge” reduction in intelligence, while in 2016 toxic nanoparticles from air pollution were discovered in human brains.The new research examined the placentas of five non-smoking women who all delivered healthy babies. The researchers isolated macrophage cells, which are part of the body’s immune system and engulf harmful particles such as bacteria and air pollution.Using an optical microscope, they found 72 dark particles among 3,500 cells and then used a powerful electron microscope to examine the shape of some of the particles. They looked very like the sooty particles found in macrophages in the lung, which catch many – but not all – of the particles.While further analysis is needed for final confirmation, Dr Miyashita said: “We can’t think of anything else they could be. It is very evident to us they are black sooty particles.” Earlier experiments have shown that particles breathed in by pregnant animals go through the bloodstream into placentas.“We do not know whether the particles we found could also move across into the foetus, but our evidence suggests this is indeed possible,” said Dr Norrice Liu, also at Queen Mary University of London and part of the team. “We also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby’s body to have an adverse effect, because if they have an effect on the placenta, this will have a direct impact on the foetus.”The research is being presented Sunday at the European Respiratory Society’s (ERS) international congress in Paris. “This research suggests a possible mechanism of how babies are affected by pollution while being theoretically protected in the womb,” said Prof Mina Gaga, who is ERS president and at the Athens Chest Hospital in Greece.“This should raise awareness amongst doctors and the public regarding the harmful effects of air pollution in pregnant women,” she said, noting that harm to foetuses can occur even below current European Union pollution limits. “We need stricter policies for cleaner air to reduce the impact of pollution on health worldwide because we are already seeing a new population of young adults with health issues.”Unicef executive director Anthony Lake recently warned of the danger of air pollution to babies: “Not only do pollutants harm babies’ developing lungs, they can permanently damage their developing brains – and, thus, their futures.”Separate research, also presented at the ERS congress, found that children with early onset and persistent asthma fared far less well in education than those without the condition. Asthma in children has long been linked to air pollution.The study, conducted over 20 years in Sweden, showed that children with asthma were three and half times more likely to leave school at the age of 16 with only basic education and were also twice as likely to drop out of university courses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371693de7d4acc3960c66e3180fba058831f33dd/413_592_2387_1432/master/2387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=166cb79a09e65cb803d62846394ae71d","title":"fish tales the women working in scotlands fishing industry in pictures","story":"Fishing fleets have long depended on female workers to process their catch.

The scintillating spell before half-time that saw Watford’s defence torn to shreds by the pace and power of José Mourinho’s frontline was a timely reminder that, despite the much-criticised start to the season, he has an attack with frightening potential.Sánchez, who was withdrawn six minutes from time to be replaced by Scott McTominay, has had an intriguing start to his United career after his late decision to spurn Manchester City. The league’s best-paid player at a whopping £391,000-a-week with an extra £75,000 for every game he plays and an annual £1.1m signing-on fee scored only twice for United in the Premier League last season in 12 appearances, and has yet to find the net in four matches in this campaign. He was deployed on the left of the front three against Watford and showed signs of a growing understanding with Lukaku in the first half, with the Belgium striker often moving wide to create space for Sánchez to burst through the middle.It was one such collaboration that provided the spark just after the half-hour mark, with Ben Foster producing a wonderful save to deny Sánchez from a tight angle. The Chile forward, who turns 30 in December, scored 24 Premier League goals in his last full season at Arsenal from a similar starting position, although his relationship with Pogba could be the key to unlocking United’s true attacking ability.The France midfielder enjoyed the advantage of United having an extra man in midfield against Watford and became increasingly influential during the purple patch before half-time. But on several occasions after the interval he and Sánchez failed to make the most of opportunities that a more ruthless side would have relished. Nonetheless, there was genuine positivity in the two-minute rendition of Herman’s Hermits’ “Something tells me I’m into something good” from the away end.The song features the line “José’s got us playing the way we should,” – a sentiment that many fans would perhaps struggle to agree with even after this morale-boosting victory. But Mourinho’s decision to pick Marouane Fellaini alongside Matic and Pogba in what must be one of the tallest midfield trios selected in the Premier League – Chelsea’s three against Cardiff on Saturday were a combined 53cm shorter – paid off as the Belgian created Chris Smalling’s second goal and helped neutralise the threat of the workaholic Troy Deeney.Starting with the trip to Switzerland to face Young Boys on Wednesday, United now embark on a series of winnable fixtures that will provide Mourinho an opportunity to fine-tune his side before his return to Stamford Bridge on 20 October. The manager appeared to have a new spring in his step after the full-time whistle, even teasing Smalling over his new haircut as he praised the England defender’s performance alongside Victor Lindelöf.Finding the right defensive combination has proved a challenge for a manager who has built his reputation on solid foundations at the back but amid all the disquiet over the failure to secure a central defender in the summer, Mourinho will hope the pieces are finally falling into place at the right time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6a4553de92e8f19ce8e4adeab72ebd756ec3912/0_18_4950_2971/master/4950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946354b94f5a42eebfd6f9ac0a04e993","title":"wolves v burnley premier league live","story":"4 min: And now Hart has to get down a smother a low Jota shot, although the forward didn’t really get a good purchase on it.

There are fireworks. “Out there boys, out there, come on!” yells a Burnley voice in the tunnel.

Most fans would presumably trade one of them for, say, a top-class forward.Joe Hart is having a Frank Conversation in a dark room with Sky. He’d love to play for England again. “I was absolutely gutted and ... other words ... that I wasn’t in the World Cup squad,” he says.

Do you think there’s only so far things can be taken in their current form? Should we all just chill out?And Wolves fans – are you loving this? Unfettered riches, global names, nice football. I very much enjoyed the atmosphere at Molineux when I covered the Everton game on the opening day. Or does it feel a bit artificial, all this? Are you conflicted? I don’t know – I’m genuinely asking. That’s what Burnley have to deal with today.The takeaway from that team news? Wolves select the same XI for the fifth game running. It means no starting place yet for Adama Traore, scorer of that late winner against West Ham.Burnley make three changes from the home defeat to Manchester United. Vokes, Barnes and Gudmundsson replace Wood, Westwood and McNeil.Quite an old-world feeling about this fixture, isn’t there? Except today it’s cut-and-thrust, cutting-edge, decidedly serious Premier League action – and there’s plenty of “narrative” to get our teeth into.Wolves go into this one feeling pretty darn happy after getting one over West Ham – the continuation of whose death march you can follow later on – and have made a very solid start to life in the top flight. They’ll be absolutely fine this season the real question, I think, is whether they have the ingenuity and firepower to string a number of wins together and make a play for the top half. It’s not beyond them. That Moutinho-Neves axis will be formidable when it gets going and the system looks very well-drilled. Just need to make sure they can score enough, I think.All this talk and conjecture will, as ever, be rendered null and void when the action starts. And it does soon, at 1.30pm UK time.

Those with partners and children have disappeared, other than posting their idyllic family life.We’ve tried all of the dating things, found no one and biological clocks are ticking. One friend said her life is not worth living because she hasn’t got a partner or a child. In the past I’d give advice and encouragement – suggest things might turn out all right in the end. There’s still time!But now there’s actually not time. I can’t encourage, because life isn’t going how we thought it would. We’re being left behind and without the financial ability (or housing) to freeze eggs or go it alone, or adopt.I get harassed by some friends, almost bullying me into going on dating apps because it worked for them. But I hated it – men were rude, unkind and I felt physically threatened. I found myself despising all men.The idea that single people in their 30s are all having fun is a lie. We are the have-nots and we are sad. What now?Mariella replies What a fascinating dilemma. It’s rare to get correspondence that embraces the bigger picture, beyond the confines of pressing personal concerns, and this is, without doubt, a major social issue of our time. I experienced the passing of my 30s myself with great relief, so predominant were the issues you identify. It’s startling to receive your reminder that in the 22 years since Bridget Jones was published (and 30 since the original column was conceived), life hasn’t changed much for women in their 30s. I’m not convinced that even millennials will have a radically altered experience of women’s still untenable position.While Helen Fielding’s book was dismissed as “women’s writing” (as though that should be an insult) at the time, it was a zeitgeist novel that summed up the state of the world for sad “singletons”. Women were told they had equality in a still wholly unequal world. Now here you are, over two decades later, experiencing the same old story. Truly society has not yet shape-shifted enough to fully integrate us.It’s hopefully cheering for you to know that for many of my generation, despite our fears, it actually worked out. I’m not just referring to those who found last-minute fathers for late children but also those who are now, for the most part, enjoying exciting, fulfilled 50s unfettered by parental responsibility. For women for whom children are a priority, you’d be amazed how much can be achieved in the few short years before you hit 40. The amplified ticking of our biological clocks seems to focus minds and energy on the single issue of motherhood in a way that often produces results. So many of my friends found partners and had children, as I did, around the age of 40. As a result, my kids have grown up seeing me not as a freak of late motherhood, but a member of a small and steadily increasing minority of older mums.Your letter confirms what I’ve long suspected – that the seismic changes needed to make the world more bearable for our sex aren’t happening fast enough or with enough focus. Women are still penalised for pregnancy, bear the main burden of domestic life (so often now combined with full-time work) and, despite increasing lifes, have the same short window in which society deems them to be fully contributing members. I’m sorry you are sad and I’m angry, too. Our nation has spent my lifetime hijacked by political parties squabbling while issues that matter – universal childcare, education, the NHS, equal pay, pornography, and violence towards women and children – have all been swept into a Westminster silo.While the Brexit bandwagon rumbles on, our country is silently slipping back to the 20th century in terms of productivity, infrastructure, education, health and social justice. Where are the fresh ideas to improve citizens’ lives? That may seem a digression, but the reason you are experiencing exactly the same frustrations as my generation, is that time really does seem to have stood still. It’s not Europe’s fault that our political classes appear incapable of blue-sky thinking and that this purported brave new, independent Britain looks very much the same as it did in 1990.There will, I firmly believe, come a time when women’s lives truly are equal and breakthroughs in medical science will be welcomed instead of fuelling hysterical headlines about pensioners giving birth. We urgently need creative thinking and collective energy to push us out of our present inertia and force the change that will improve all our lives.Small changes initiate huge ones and stepping beyond your comfort zone is an imperative first step. I’m convinced that if you and your friends focus further on shaping the world you want and worry less about what the fates will bring, your chances of fulfilment and happiness will soar. And, of course, unfollow all the smug marrieds on Insta who, behind the scenes, are probably ruing the day they shacked up as often as you wish you could join them!

You won’t have the same problem with an audiobook. You may even find yourself so enthralled that you run an extra mile without noticing Last year, when Peter Johnston turned 50, he had a life crisis. The Stockport native had a successful career as an IT consultant, a loving wife, two young daughters, and plenty of friends to go to the pub with most evenings. But on his 50th birthday, as he went into his bathroom to shave, he remembers not liking what he saw in the mirror.“I was evidently overweight, pale skin, bumps all over my face – you name it. I didn’t look good at all.” He admits that it’s probably a phase that most men his age tend to go through, a “realisation that you’re now definitely old, and that it’s going to be more difficult to keep up in the same way I used to be able to”. Which scared him, especially because he wanted to be healthy enough to play with his daughters and be a good dad for them as they grow up. He decided to take up jogging, with the aim of running his first half-marathon before his 51st birthday. He bought new running shoes and gym clothes, and his wife helped him set up a music playlist on his phone. He was all set to go, but he found his runs difficult.Not because he wasn’t able to endure them, but rather, that listening to music was not right for him. “After a while, I’d get bored – especially when you’re listening to the same tracks again. Don’t get me wrong, I love ACDC, but there are only so many times I can listen to Shoot to Thrill. Or, when you aren’t feeling a track but you can’t change it without interrupting your run,” he says. “Worse,” he adds, “when you’re in a busier area, like a high street, and you want to change the song, you have to keep jogging, while playing with your phone and making sure you don’t run into anyone. It’s a nightmare.” A work friend recommended that Johnston change his tune not to other forms of music, but, rather, to audiobooks – full-length books told through high-quality audio narrations, and presented in formats similar to podcasts. The medium has grown rapidly over the past five years, particularly on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones – and Audible now provides the world’s largest selection of audiobooks. According to the UK’s Publishers’ Association, around one in 10 Brits are now listening to audiobooks, while spending on the medium has more than doubled in the past five years to a total of £31m. Research commissioned by Audible from University College London earlier this year showed that audiobooks produced a stronger emotional and physiological response compared with visual storytelling mediums such as TV and video streaming, regardless of the genre of content being listened to. For Johnston, listening to audiobooks has multiple benefits. For starters, he says: “I’m actually reading a lot more.” He started off with Yuval Noah Hari’s Sapiens: A History of Humankind, which Johnston described as one of the “most thought provoking listens” of his life. “When you’re running, and listening to what’s basically the origin of human thought, why we do what we do, it’s pretty amazing,” he says. “I was listening to it while running through the countryside one weekend, and I was so engrossed in it, thinking about what was being said, and how that shaped the world around me I’d forgotten about my distance completely. I’d run a mile longer without even realising.” And it’s not just while running that he’s found audiobooks useful. Like millions around the world, he also listens to audiobooks when doing general day-to-day activities such as driving, doing household chores, and even when he’s relaxing in the bath. His favourites tend to be non-fiction titles, with one recently being Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, which he stumbled on while browsing recommended titles on Audible. “It’s such a fascinating book,” says Johnston. “And it’s told in a really interesting and engaging way that’s humorous, but also really exciting. I wasn’t really that good at science in school, but I learned more about quantum physics from listening to that book while doing the laundry the other week than I did in four years of studying it at school.” Johnston will turn 51 in October. Since his birthday, he’s 12kg lighter, leaner, and says he feels “better than I’ve ever done in my life”. And that’s not just in his physical fitness, but, thanks to audiobooks, mentally too. “I’ve been able to discover all these things that I otherwise wouldn’t have the time to go out looking for,” he says. “I can browse through the library on my phone, or just type in a subject I find interesting one day and voila – I’ll find loads of books I can listen to at the tips of my fingers.”“Audiobooks aren’t just a way of keeping me entertained while I run miles,” says Johnston. “They’ve given me the opportunity to learn something new every day.”Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The scientific search for ways to improve our sense of sight is truly inspiringPretty much as soon as humans stopped battling to stay alive 24 hours a day, the first thing they did was look up into the sky and wonder about the sun. The earliest religions made the sun into a god. In August, Nasa launched its Parker Solar Probe to take a closer look. And if you want to define what it is to be human – and to explain how we got from baffled apes to space explorers – it’s pretty much all in there. We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53fcac2e7f31cb4ee81eb9b5705801b9237a81c0/0_435_5170_3102/master/5170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45db4c7fb3eda8836aa8b8921ea38d7a","title":"david crosby friends review palace theatre manchester","story":"Palace theatre, ManchesterThe counterculture veteran purrs as richly as his twentysomething self and rages about today’s police shootings in a revelatory concertNot many musicians have had such colossal impact on popular music as David Crosby.

When a guy at the back yells: “I love you David!”, Crosby grins and fires back: “I love it when you say that, but can you get your sister to shout it next time?” Apparently, the gruff male overtures remind him of prison. His long day began hours earlier, when he pricked the cosy BBC Breakfast TV atmosphere with an irate rant about record company “thievery” (over streaming), before explaining that playing with younger “friends” had fired a creative renaissance of four albums in five years. There’s nothing in the set yet from next month’s album Here If You Listen, but the title track of 2017’s Sky Trails, “about being lost – but not geographically”, is beautifully pensive. “Touring is like having my own rocket ship,” he smiles. “I can go anywhere – and pick any song – I want.” His first set includes the title track of CSNY’s seminal Déjà Vu from 1969 and Long Time Gone, Crosby’s emotional response to the assassination of Bobby Kennedy the previous year. The five-piece, international, mixed gender band (including Crosby’s son James Raymond) render the four-part harmonies and jazzy folk-rock superbly. “If this were California, we’d go and smoke a joint, but here we’ll breathe some clean air”, says “Croz”, exiting for an interval, returning minus the woolly hat that he told breakfast telly was made by his wife. As the old pipes warm up, his singing is rich and revelatory: somehow, he can purr and roar like his twentysomething self.He dips into a well of anecdotes to explain why 1982’s Delta is “difficult”. He was a “junkie”, but musician friend Jackson Browne refused to let him leave to score until he had finished the mesmeric song about “choice and chance”. By now, the crowd are on their feet. The white-haired old Byrd is on fire. With Jeff Pevar’s scintillating guitar runs, that group’s classic Eight Miles High is jazzier, perhaps closer to how Crosby and co-writers Gene Clark and Roger McGuinn intended it as a tribute to John Coltrane. Almost Cut My Hair, Crosby’s signature countercultural anthem, is faster, with a dirtier riff and guitar duelling. As he alludes, the wave of police shootings of black people in America means that CSNY’s 1970s protest single Ohio – about the Kent State University killings of students by national guardsmen – is as relevant as ever. The audience sing the haunting “four dead in Ohio” refrain as Crosby angrily rages: “How many more? I wanna know why!” Then he humbly acknowledges the last standing ovation and walks away, with another entry for the bulging memory bank of a remarkable life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e3669b582ea2d44a452476fb6164eeb9aa8c686/0_166_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0940ad2884071345191795f6a818ff57","title":"janelle monae review roundhouse london michaela coel","story":"Roundhouse, LondonFrom water-pistols to vagina trousers, the fun never stops at the eclectic artist’s formidable live showNot only does the revolutionary pop singer and toast of 2018, Janelle Monáe, stage-e at the end of the second night of her London residency she crowdsurfs. Not only does she crowdsurf, held up by scores of adoring hands she strikes poses on the sea of people, grinning like a Cheshire cat. She cocks up a knee, as though lounging on a beach towel. Then she “swims” backwards, towards the shore of the stage.It’s the glacé cherry on a knickerbocker glory of a performance, one which sees her invite British comedy star Michaela Coel on stage to dance to I Got the Juice as one of four fan-guests. Another invitee boogies her motorised wheelchair around. Like the leader of a soul revue – James Brown reborn in a more advanced female future – Monáe leads her five-strong band and four dancers through a series of precision-timed stabs of end-game sound, each louder and more emphatic than the last. The song, which could happily go on for ever, is Come Alive (War of the Roses) – a zombie romp from her 2010 Fritz Lang-themed concept album, The ArchAndroid.Back then, Monáe had an alter ego, the future android Cindi Mayweather she wore top-to-toe black and white and exposed no flesh, paying tribute to the uniforms worn by service industry operatives like her parents. Covering up in this way was a sublimely radical act on the part of a young African American woman who wanted to make a living singing and dancing, but not be crushed by the sausage machine of R\u0026ampB starletry her widescreen art drew from funk, rock, new wave and classical music as well as neo-soul, prefiguring all the eclecticism and cerebral artiness now practised by stars like Solange, Frank Ocean and Beyoncé. Like one of her idols, Lauryn Hill, she sang, she rapped her “wokeness” came couched in stylish playfulness.By the end of tonight’s set, this new, flesh-and-blood Monáe is peeling off successive layers of magnificent costume-armour: a cartoon Napoleonic greatcoat with bleeding, glittery red epaulettes, boots, two-tone Lycra catsuit, quasi-military, quasi-African cap. Her dancers lose their “Highly Melanated” crop tops – a lyric from Monáe’s most powerful rapped outing, Django Jane – until they are all down to a black leotard. There have been inspirational speeches about love and difference and the importance of good mental health. Monáe has danced the standing crowd down to a crouch for Tightrope, her breakthrough tune of 2010, and then gee’d them all back up again to a leaping mass. “You can’t get too high!” she sings. “You can’t get too low!”It works as a dance routine it works as wisdom too: for all Monáe’s playful visuals, spectacular costumes, ample Prince and Michael Jackson references, the substance underlying all these visual goodies is deeply nourishing. Just one example: Screwed is a nagging pop song about the political upheavals of 2016 onwards (“The devil met with Russia and they just made a deal”), an analysis of sexual power relations worthy of a women’s studies syllabus and, you know, just a celebration of getting it on. The chorus is matter-of-fact: “You fucked the world up now, we’ll fuck it all back down.” At the end, the dancers spray everyone with water pistols.Those anxieties – that Monáe might be, y’know, dull compared to a cyborg alter ego – are pretty much dead in the water, as her arsenal of ideas and clarion calls unfolds, song by song, costume by costume, feat of timing after feat of timing. The pregnant pause at the false ending of Django Jane, where Monáe raps “let the vagina have a monologue”, is exquisite. The section devoted to Electric Lady – Monáe’s perfectly inspirational album of 2013 – feels a tad like a lull, but only because the selections from Dirty Computer and The ArchAndroid are so strong.And of course, there are some glorious knickerbockers, and all they represent. Back in April, Monáe unveiled the video for Pynk. A song about everyone’s intimate regions, the folds of the brain and girl-positive oral sex, its key visual motifs were the labial leggings worn by Monáe and her dancers.They look as outrageous in the flesh tonight as they do in the video, which is played back on three giant screens. Raunchy and funny by turns, Monáe and her dancers are flanked by two female members of the band playing big white keytars. Really, the merchandise stand is the only disappointment tonight. Why are there T-shirts and baseball caps on sale when there could be orgasmic organza workout-wear?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82cf77037533cef7f8eb08505856d1c85a8eb42e/0_522_7320_4391/master/7320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb8edeb7e05d70785b0164685a3b5270","title":"labour figures slam claim that michael foot was paid by soviets","story":"Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock and John McDonnell condemn re-emergence of claim eight years after ex-Labour leader’s deathSenior Labour figures and the family of former party leader Michael Foot have reacted with anger over the re-emergence of the explosive claim that he was a paid Soviet informant.Neil Kinnock, who succeeded Foot as Labour leader, said his predecessor had been a “passionate and continual critic of the Soviet Union” in response to the allegation that MI6 believed Foot had been a paid informant.Labour’s current leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and Foot’s descendants were among those to condemn the publication of the claims eight years after his death. Foot successfully sued the Sunday Times when it published similar allegations 23 years ago.The story comes as Britain’s relationship with Moscow is yet again at a low ebb after two Russian nationals were charged over the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The pair have since said they were in the city to visit its cathedral.The original allegations about Foot date back to the claims of Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky, who alleged that the former Labour leader had received clandestine payments from the KGB and had been classed by the organisation as an “agent” and “confidential contact”.The fresh claim appears in a new book, The Spy and the Traitor, by the Times writer Ben Macintyre and also featured on the newspaper’s front page on Saturday.Kinnock said Foot had always been an opponent of the Soviet Union’s “internal and external despotism”.“He would never have served their purposes,” he said. “When these allegations were made against him in 1995 he sued the Sunday Times and won substantial damages. He has been dead for eight years. Repeating such claims without any substantive additional proof is filthy.”McDonnell told the Observer: “Michael Foot was a good and honest socialist whose only desire was to serve our country. Elements of the British media are sinking to new lows in debasing standards of journalism in this country. They used to be called the gutter press. Now they inhabit the sewers.”Corbyn tweeted on Saturday: John Foot, a great nephew of the former Labour leader, tweeted: “My great-uncle Michael Foot was a lifelong anti-Stalinist. Friend of Orwell ... Ludicrous to claim he was a Soviet spy. Sued successfully for libel around this when he was alive. No evidence. Shameful and cowardly.”Chris Mullin, the former Labour minister who worked with Foot, said he believed the claim was “cowardly ... given that Michael Foot is in no position to answer back”, adding: “He was a good, honourable man and a democrat to his fingertips.”Macintyre’s new book states that MI6 agents had been told about Gordievsky’s claims in the summer of 1982. It also says they concluded that Foot had not been a “spy or conscious agent”, but had been used for “disinformation purposes” and received the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money.It says that they were prepared to warn the Queen, should Labour have won the election in 1983. “Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election,” it states. “It was agreed that should a politician with a KGB history become prime minister of Britain, then the Queen would have to be informed.”The Times’ coverage of the story suggests that, had the new revelations been known at the time that the allegations first emerged, “it is unlikely Foot would have resorted to the libel courts”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de6b3c98c37d5ba3da331c541d5119959bf075c4/185_110_4045_2428/master/4045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39f9c13e7cbe74c154a8511ea44afa07","title":"sadiq khan new referendum peoples vote labour corbyn","story":"Mayor of London’s call for people’s vote adds to pressure on Jeremy CorbynThe mayor of London has issued a dramatic call for another referendum on EU membership, insisting that the people must be given the chance to reject a Brexit deal that will be bad for the economy, jobs and the NHS.Writing in the Observer, Sadiq Khan says that, with so little time left to negotiate, there are now only two possible outcomes: a bad deal for the UK or “no deal” at all, which will be even worse. “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods,” he writes.Khan says that backing a second referendum was never something he expected to have to do. But so abject has been the government’s performance, and so great is the threat to living standards and jobs, he says, that he sees no alternative than to give people a chance to stay in the EU.“This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the government, or a vote on a ‘no-deal’ Brexit if one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU,” he writes. “People didn’t vote to leave the EU to make themselves poorer, to watch their businesses suffer, to have NHS wards understaffed, to see the police preparing for civil unrest or for our national security to be put at risk if our cooperation with the EU in the fight against terrorism is weakened.”The intervention from one of Labour’s most powerful politicians will put yet more pressure on the party leader Jeremy Corbyn to throw his support behind another referendum at Labour’s annual conference, which opens in Liverpool next weekend.More than 100 anti-Brexit motions, and motions backing another referendum, or people’s vote, have been submitted by constituency parties – believed to be a record for any single issue in the party’s recent history.A large number of the motions are from the left of the party, and call for a commitment to a people’s vote to be inserted into Labour’s next general election manifesto.Sam Tarry, national political officer of the TSSA union, who used to work for Corbyn, said the left of the Labour party was uniting behind demands for another vote: “The sheer weight of anti-Brexit motions going to conference is unlike anything I have ever seen – and the only force in the Labour party capable of pulling that off is the left. The trade union movement has moved quickly towards an anti-Tory Brexit position this summer. There is this feeling that we, the socialist left, simply cannot stand by and watch while workers and communities are sacrificed at the altar of Tory dogma and imperial nostalgia.”Until now Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have said they would prefer the public to be given a say on Brexit in a fresh general election, adding that, if one does not happen soon, the option of a second referendum should remain open. But leftwingers in the party now say this formula is not sufficient, and want a commitment to another referendum in the next manifesto.Alena Ivanova, a leading activist for the grassroots group Momentum in east London, said: “This is a campaign now being led by the left... Tory Brexit is a fundamental threat to the rights and prosperity of working-class people and the communities that Labour represents, driven by bosses and rightwing ideologues. We will only stop it with unashamed leftwing internationalism and, crucially, that will also help us in the campaign to get the Corbyn government we need.”Recognition of the case for a new referendum also appears to be growing in Tory circles. On Saturday the Conservative MP George Freeman, a former chair of Theresa May’s policy board, said on Twitter that pressure for a second vote would become “overwhelming” should moderate Conservatives fail to shape a sensible Brexit deal.Theresa May will travel to Salzburg in Austria on Wednesday in another attempt to sell her Chequers deal on Brexit to EU leaders at an informal summit. Several European leaders, as well as the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, have already raised serious doubts about key elements of the plan.

I have to acknowledge the parliamentary arithmetic.“I believe the critical thing is making sure we leave in good order with a deal which safeguards the referendum mandate.”Conservative MPs who oppose the Chequers deal, including the former Brexit secretary, David Davis, are to ramp up public opposition in the coming weeks with a series of rallies across the country.Davis will share a platform with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the hard Brexit European Research Group of MPs. Others who will speak at the rallies, organised by the pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, include the former Brexit minister David Jones and the former environment secretary Owen Paterson, as well as the Labour MP Kate Hoey.The rallies will kick off next Saturday in Bolton with Farage, Davis and Hoey, an event that organisers say has almost sold out. Other rallies will take place in Birmingham during the Conservative party conference and continue on to Torquay, Bournemouth, Gateshead and Harrogate.Richard Tice, the vice-chair of Leave Means Leave, said: “Leave Means Leave will be travelling across the country to make the case that the prime minister should chuck the Chequers plan and save £39bn.“The cross-party nature of the campaign proves how important this battle is. Party politics has been put to one side to secure what is best for Britain’s future.”Gove was also asked about Hungary’s hard right prime minister Viktor Orban after Tory MEPs opposed a censure motion against the Hungarian government in the European parliament this week.Gove said he had “views” about Mr Orban but was “not going to be drawn” into giving an assessment of inidual leaders.\u0026nbsp“It’s not for me to rank a league table of EU leaders and to say that one is my favourite or that one have less time for,” he said. “Because I believe in cooperative diplomacy - I believe in generosity of spirit towards EU partners.”His remarks drew immediate criticism. Conservative pundit Iain Dale said on Twitter that he was “very disappointed” in Gove’s words, while the Labour MP David Lammy said that the remarks displayed “complete moral bankruptcy”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd87ca0ee4c282933a1c62303970c6d6bee2eafd/0_160_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5802b63d50028db295091ba02720ed38","title":"universal credit costs self employed thousands of pounds a year","story":"A coalition of businesses, unions and charities is demanding a rethink of the government’s welfare reforms, warning they will damage entrepreneurship and cost some self-employed people thousands of pounds a year.Concerns have already been raised about the potential impact of universal credit on the self-employed, with analysts saying the system is biased against those who set up their own companies. Someone who is self-employed can receive up to £2,500 less than an employee with the same earnings.With the budget approaching, Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, is facing demands for an overhaul of the rules. In a letter to her, the coalition says the current system is skewed against the 4.8\u0026nbspmillion people who work for themselves. The Federation of Small Businesses, the Royal Society of Arts, the National Farmers’ Union, the Trussell Trust food bank charity and the Gingerbread charity for single parents are among the groups to sign the letter.“As things stand, a self-employed person can receive thousands of pounds less in universal credit payments each year compared to an employee earning exactly the same amount,” they write. “We believe there are steps that can be taken to ensure the system adequately supports the self-employed and promotes entrepreneurship.“The self-employed deserve to be treated fairly by our social security system. To continue maintaining record levels of employment and promote entrepreneurship, the design of universal credit for the self-employed must be reviewed urgently.”The issue arose as a result of a feature called the “minimum income floor” – an assumed level of earnings which is used to calculate universal credit payments for the self-employed, but not employees. After a one-year grace period, self-employed people have to meet the floor before they become entitled to universal credit.However, many self-employed workers have said they will be penalised because they do not receive a regular and steady income that would satisfy the minimum income floor rules – meaning they will lose out. The coalition warns that a sole trader earning £12,000 a year can receive £2,500 less each year through universal credit than an employee earning the same amount.Problems in the system are likely to worsen as universal credit is rolled out further, with 700,000 self-employed people expected to be claiming it by 2022.A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the system was designed to reflect the way most people are paid. “We recognise the importance of entrepreneurship in boosting the economy, however it’s unfair for taxpayers to prop up unviable businesses,” she said. “If after a year, gainfully self-employed people aren’t earning the minimum wage from their business, they’ll be asked to increase their earnings or take on additional employment.”Universal credit has already had to be overhauled because claimants were waiting up to six weeks for their first payment, with many falling into rent arrears. There are calls for its rollout to be frozen.Last week, it emerged that the government’s own assessment of universal credit suggested there was no evidence that punishing part-time claimants for failing to find more work was encouraging them to increase their hours.One of the key claims by those who backed universal credit was that it would increase the working hours of those receiving it. The threat of financial sanctions is used to force claimants to boost their hours. However, a three-year trial found that while the threat of sanctions ensured that claimants followed the rules set by Job Centre staff, “there was no evidence that it helped motivate participants to progress in work”.The trial also showed that those who had to undertake frequent compulsory activity, designed to boost their wages, only increased their weekly earnings by £5 more than those who had the most minimal requirements.Furthermore, the published figures do not take account of the gradual withdrawal of benefits as people increase their earnings, meaning the actual boost to claimants’ incomes during the trial is likely to have been lower than reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8fe77dd8f18df445f68e2dbeb50b6181e07d2e1/0_0_2585_1551/master/2585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d84dc33958c344386957e9c53ea174f","title":"croydon beyond the blade podcast","story":"Half of Britain’s teenage stabbing deaths happen in London.

He doesn’t want to create too many problems for anyone. There were other players in the team who wanted to take it further but he talked them into not taking it any further.”According to Moeen’s account of the incident, the player in question denied saying “Take that, Osama” – taken as a reference to Osama bin Laden on account of Moeen’s Muslim faith and appearance – and instead explained the comment as: “Take that, part-timer.”Moeen says he struggled to accept this response at the time and when the two teams socialised at the end of series, which England won by 3-2, the player in question told him: “I know what you thought I said but I didn’t say that. I’ve got Muslim friends and some of my best friends are Muslims.”Bayliss, who was overseeing his first Test series in charge, has since said he did not receive a response from Lehmann after raising the issue with him. But he nevertheless considered the matter to have been dealt with, and no further such problems arose.He added: “Well I didn’t get a response. I just left it with Darren to sort out one way or the other. I didn’t hear any response, but everything was dealt with then.Lehmann has since stepped down as Australia’s head coach following the ball-tampering scandal in March that saw Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft handed lengthy bans and prompted a review into the culture of the men’s national team.Moeen’s revelation came at the start of a personally rewarding day on Saturday, with the England all-rounder going on to lead Worcestershire to their first ever T20 Blast title with a five-wicket victory over Sussex on Finals Day at Edgbaston.The 31-year-old claimed five wickets and scored 82 runs across the semi-final and final – the former a 20-run victory over Lancashire – and was widely praised for his captaincy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19db821d622cb98055e83a361b71f6d579ac7a06/0_38_2532_1519/master/2532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=554073dd0981fd99fa55d37b48988bc6","title":"the hundred crickets brave new world on trial","story":"Away from the life-affirming afterglow of England’s gripping Test series with India, Surrey’s first county title in 16 years and another packed T20 finals day, cricket’s future is being shaped at two empty grounds with trials of the new 100‑ball format having begun.The Hundred, a five-week tournament featuring eight invented teams and intended to capture a supposed new audience for the sport, will land in the middle of the summer from 2020 onwards. And to ensure the actual cricket is up to scratch, six days of testing is taking place this month using around 40 male and female county players.These pilot matches got under way on Friday and Saturday at Loughborough University, with women cricketers acting as the first triallists. The men start three straight days at Trent Bridge on Sunday before a final outing for the women on 27 September. Only Monday’s session is open to the media as the England and Wales Cricket Board’s cricket department tries to deliver a workable formula from the brief handed down by the marketing folk.This, essentially, is to reinvent the sport for the layman, breaking down perceived barriers to entry and jargon by devising a simple 100 balls-per-innings match. The number of deliveries will go down on the scoreboard as the number of runs goes up, with the job done in around two and a half hours to suit the needs of\u0026nbspbroadcasters.These pilot days are not matches but are instead being used to explore different in-game scenarios and playing conditions – that is, powerplays and fielding restrictions – with the players set to then give feedback on “flow and duration of the game, tactical innovation and player enjoyment” to the ECB.Behind the scenes Trent Woodhill, a freelance Twenty20 coach with tournaments such as Australia’s Big Bash League and the Indian Premier League on his CV, has been working as a consultant to the ECB and meeting players around the counties in the past month to brief them on The Hundred.Luke Wright, the Sussex T20 captain, has sat in on one of Woodhill’s seminars and as one of the country’s most successful short-form exports – he too has plied his trade in the BBL and the IPL, as well as the Pakistan Super League and its Bangladeshi equivalent – he hopes the cricketing public keeps an open mind about The Hundred.Since the 100-ball concept was first announced by the ECB in April there have been various gimmicks floated, such as teams being able to deploy all 15 members of their squad in a game and, of course, the continuing debate as to how 100 balls can be ided by a sport long used to dealing in overs of six legal deliveries. It is now expected each innings will be made up of 20 five-ball overs in blocks of two per end, with the option of a bowler sending down all 10 deliveries if on a roll but restricted to 20 in total. As regards the number of players, Woodhill has told Wright it is simply a case of substitute fielders being permitted to augment the standard.Wright, a World T20 winner with England in 2010, added: “I remember being in the Sussex changing room when the Twenty20 Cup was introduced in 2003 and the senior players had no interest for a season or two – it was great as it gave guys like me a chance – but when the crowds started flocking in, those guys thought: ‘We’ll have a bit of this.’“People may be cynical and say I’m endorsing it because I want a gig in it. But I’ll be 35 by then. I\u0026nbspjust think it will work. Some will disagree with me and I might be wrong, but it is going to happen. We won’t lose the Blast and fans will still come to that too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c73a1376c6bdffc777604644e28495b195f10e3b/371_0_2568_1542/master/2568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6782f12ad3c3c9bfa1c06ee9a3de82e","title":"f1 singapore grand prix live","story":"Lap 961: There is not an awful lot between the front three of Hamilton, Vettel and Verstappen. In fact, there is only 27-odd seconds between first and 18th. The pits will prove pivotal at Marina Bay. “The car’s really good,” Verstappen, the Red Bull driver, says. Lap 761: Vettel sets the tone early on, with a fastest lap of 1min 47.397sec. Meanwhile, a nugget of news on that damage to Sirotkin, whose Williams ended up with a bit of Ocon’s car in its front wing. Elsewhere, Pierre Gasly has made a decent start, up three to 12th.Lap 661: A nimble Verstappen, with the help of DRS, is trying to eat away at the gap to Vettel. That’s piling the pressure on the Ferrari, who is firmly on the tail of Hamilton, the race leader. 561: We’re back racing! After crawling through the final throws of the safety car, Hamilton bolted away from Vettel, acutely aware the Ferrari could do with a bit of time to warm-up his tyres to find some pace. He leads Vettel by just over one second, with Verstappen, the Red Bull, a healthy 2sec behind the German. Lap 461: A good start by Carlos Sainz and Fernando Alonso who have leapfrogged Nico Hülkenberg into ninth and 10th respectively. Further back the grid, Sergey Sirotkin seems to have a bit of damage to his front wing. Meanwhile, Ocon’s car has been scooped off the track and the driver is heading for the paddock. “I got hit by Sergio – badly,” he says. For now, the safety car continues to lead the way.Lap 361: Clearly, that incident between Pérez and Ocon was a result of the former not giving his Force India colleague racing room. Pérez is very apologetic, Ocon, whose race is over and car’s front wheel dangling by a thread, does not sound quite so unforgiving, though.Lap 261: Of that incident at turn three, Sergio Pérez says: “Sorry guys, there was no room. Basically, I did not even see him.” The stewards are investigating that clash between the two Force Indias. Already then, we have a safety car, after a very clean start by Vettel – who went toe-to-toe with Verstappen down Raffles Boulevard – and Hamilton out in front.Hamilton zooms off the front of the grid, but behind him there’s a bit of drama, with Esteban Ocon heading off into the wall, via his Force India team-mate Sergio Pérez. Vettel and Verstappen go wheel-to-wheel down the chicane and we have a safety car owing to that Ocon first-lap incident and the resulting debris on track.We are just a formation lap away from the off. The top 10 drivers are all starting on the hypersoft tyres. Under the lights of the Marina Bay circuit, the stage is very much set in Singapore ...The pre-cursor to the main event in Singapore was, of course, Liam Gallagher taking centre stage before qualifying. The Oasis singer dedicated Some Might Say to none other than Lewis Hamilton, with the Mercedes driver proceeding to record a memorable pole. Post-pole, The Killers performed, while Jimmy Carr has been parading around the Mercedes paddock today. All fun and games.Alain Prost, the four-times F1 champion, is back at the heart of the sport as a special adviser to Renault. As he tells Giles Richards, being an outsider battling against the odds is a key motivating factor:Lewis Hamilton turned on the style early on in qualifying, smashing the track record with a magical first lap around the spectacular Marina Bay circuit, meaning the rest of Saturday’s action made pretty comfortable viewing as he put his feet up. It could prove a lap and a pole that just gives Hamilton the chance to accelerate from Sebastian Vettel, the Ferrari who trails him by 30 points in the drivers’ standings and could only manage third. The Red Bull of Max Verstappen, meanwhile, managed to join the Brit on the front of the grid. Hamilton’s lap left Vettel reeling, Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal lost for words and his longtime race engineer, Peter Bonnington, absolutely ecstatic. “That was pretty epic,” he beamed after watching Hamilton whizz around in 1min 36.015sec. As for Hamilton, he said: “That lap started perfect and it just kept going. It felt like one of the best – if not the best lap I’ve ever done. It is the most challenging circuit for us – it is Monaco on steroids.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b96b8367123a7ff4aec0f788fe17f0296e0f88a0/0_687_4864_2919/master/4864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c6de01cfed6c6e0fb3c88a418728967","title":"new radicals 2018 disrupt disability wheelchair design","story":"Adaptable wheelchairs that use bicycle technology and 3D printing• Michael Sheen introduces the 2018 New Radicals winners• Raise Your Gaze: “Islamic feminism is overlooked in the mainstream’Like many people, Rachael Wallach gets frustrated and annoyed when she encounters restricting attitudes. But unlike most of us, she tends to channel that dissatisfaction into finding a solution. Half her lifetime ago, when she was 18, she broke her spine and lost the use of her legs. It meant that a lot of things that she had assumed she was going to do – like take a gap year to go travelling – were instantly rendered impossible.But she adapted to her situation, studied philosophy at Cambridge University, and went on to work in various positions in the public sector to do with improving the plight of people with disabilities. In her 30s, however, she decided that she wanted to go backpacking, in the way that she had missed out on when she was a teenager.So she flew to Thailand and travelled around that country, and others in the far east. These were places that guide books told her didn’t cater for the disabled, but she didn’t let that deter her. Sometimes she found herself climbing out of her wheelchair and hauling herself up stairs by her arms – something she wouldn’t dare do, for example, at a posh restaurant in London that didn’t have a wheelchair ramp. And often she found a willingness among people to allow her to do things that, back home, they’d too often refuse on the grounds of health and safety constraints or insurance concerns.The experience got her thinking about adaptability, and in particular how society ignores the inidual needs of wheelchair users. The one-size-fits-all mentality is exemplified by the wheelchair design itself: basically useful butrather unvaried in form and function.It’s like the early days of NHS glasses frames, she says. “When you can only wear one kind of frame, then glasses become stigmatising. That’s true of other medical devices as well.”Her answer was to offer alternatives – customised wheelchairs, with different size and design of seats made to suit the occupant, and different set-ups so that they can travel on sand or snow or other difficult terrain. In 2016 she set up a company, Disrupt Disability, which makes adaptable wheelchairs with bicycle technology and seats made by 3D printing.The business is in its infancy, and the prototypes are not yet as inexpensive as she expects them to be. But she is avowedly commercial in her outlook. Currently completing an MA in business studies in California, she is looking for global reach. Referring to Britain, she says: “The NHS focuses on how it can meet the most need. It doesn’t have the capacity, and it probably isn’t right for the NHS to shape the commercial side of the market.”She wants to empower wheelchair users by responding to them as consumers. In the same way that there is now a wealth of spectacle frames available, Wallach wants to see wheelchair users benefit from the same liberating choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e1d9cd17c07db550e430f7924612624b700ec0/0_0_5558_3336/master/5558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7ed285319c81b18989b531b97fed3fa","title":"japan family holiday jay ranyner japanese food tokyo kyoto mount fuji","story":"Instead of lazing by the Med,  Jay Rayner decided to take his family to Japan. It wasn’t an entirely selfless act … food played a major part, naturallyGetting to eat the good stuff in Tokyo can be a challenge. The problem isn’t finding the right places. The concierge team at the city’s hotels work harder than most making restaurant reservations, and ours at the Mandarin Oriental is no exception. They have sent us to a bustling, wood-lined izakaya, or food pub, down a side street in the city’s Akasaka district. Here, smoke pirouettes from the grills in the open kitchens, the beer, like the air conditioning, is beautifully chilled and the tables are crowded with locals.The problem is that the place is so very local, so very Tokyo, that quite reasonably no one here speaks English, and we speak no Japanese apart from the good manners of “hello” and “thank you”. Or so we think. Suddenly our 18-year-old son, Eddie, is sorting the order. He can do numbers and a few other phrases, enough to get an omakase request – roughly, the chef’s choice – under way. We are served blocks of silken tofu under umami-rich tangles of dried fish, plump, gossamer-skinned gyoza and tempura-ed fritters of sweetcorn. Thanks in part to Eddie, we do eat the good stuff.We shouldn’t have been surprised. After all, the trip was based on our two teenage boys’ engagement with Japanese culture from London. Eddie and his 14-year-old brother, Dan, have long been armpit deep in the stuff. They have watched endless anime, read manga and played the games. They know a good bowl of ramen from the merely mediocre. It should be no surprise that Eddie has picked up some of the language. I suggest to my other half that instead of our usual holiday lazing by a European pool, we should be intrepid and together explore the real Japan before our sons are too old to want anything to do with us. Pat looks at the weather forecast. “You know it’s stinking hot in Japan in August,” she says.I nod and say: “But ramen… I have my priorities.”Exploring Japan is not straightforward. In the major cities, many signs and announcements are in English, but an awful lot isn’t. The culture is deceptively complex, and a bit of help can save a lot of time and anxiety. We have a tour company called Inside Japan on our side. They have sorted the itinerary, supplying us with pre-loaded cards for the Tokyo metro, along with Japan Rail passes which enable us to take the famed bullet trains from Tokyo to Kyoto, and finally into the forest around Mount Fuji.They secure us tickets for a sumo match and one morning we rattle out across the seemingly endless low-rise Tokyo suburbs to a local gymnasium, where we are among the very few non-Japanese in a crowd of thousands. Huge, melon-bellied men wrestle each other for mere seconds amid the slap of chest on chest, in between lengthy bouts of ritual and chanting. It’s utterly compelling.Naturally, we visit Akihabara, or “Electric Town”, a tight knot of high-rise streets back in the centre of Tokyo full of gadget shops and video game arcades. I assume it will be a tribute to the cutting edge and there is a lot of that. But the boys, who in their bedrooms have quietly been turning the games of my youth into the stuff of their retro cool, take us back into our own pasts. On the fifth floor of a multi-layered, tinkling video arcade, we challenge each other to games of Bomberman and Street Fighter II circa 1991. I lose. Repeatedly. Later, Eddie returns on his own – he’s completely untangled the Gordian Knot that is the Tokyo subway – and comes back with armfuls of manga merch. (He has also downloaded a language app, and his Japanese vocabulary is expanding daily.)Dan picks up a piece of Akihabra’s finest, a Nintendo GameCube from the early noughties complete with a copy of Super Mario Sunshine, which joins us on the Shinkansen or bullet train to Kyoto. It doesn’t matter that the whip-fierce tail of Typhoon Shanshan crashed into Tokyo the night before, slapping the city with high winds and torrential rain. The trains keep to stereotype and run not just to the minute but to the second.In Kyoto, one of the country’s cultural and historic centres, we have a traditional townhouse, or machiya, just up the hill from the imposing Hokanji Temple Pagoda. It’s a small, wood-built, two-storey affair with a window looking out on to an ornamental garden and the most delicious air-conditioning. Pat wasn’t wrong: it is 37C in Kyoto, with humidity to match. By day, in the company of a guide, Pat and I attempt the shrines and pagodas, building a sweat climbing the myriad steps, and cooling down courtesy of sugar-flavoured shaved ice. We visit the 1,001 intricate golden statues, housed in the Sanjusangen-do temple, and guarded by 30 carved gods, many of whom look furious about being there. We tour a porcelain festival, gawp at the prices for the most delicate of ceramics, but find our way to bowls etched with images of branch and leaf at a price we can just about afford. We even take tea with a trainee geisha called Mameaki – a maiko in local dialect – although by this time the boys have bailed on us, defeated by the temperatures. We conclude this is no bad thing. They may well have found her, and the formality of the tea ceremony she presides over, disconcerting. She answers all our questions politely, but there is something jarring about a young woman of 17 who has chosen a role for herself that is essentially decorative.Still, as dusk falls, the whole family takes to the paved streets of Gion, the traditional Geisha area, where the alleyways teem with Japanese and Chinese tourists dressed in traditional kimonos for the day. Here every other building seems to be marked by a red lantern indicating an inn or restaurant. We queue up winding stairs for 45 minutes for intense and comforting bowls of “black” ramen, its thick stock made with charred miso. We try to look elegant, seated on the floor around burners of bubbling shabu-shabu hot pot. One night, in our own private tatami room, we are served a delicately poised multi-course kaiseki menu of sashimi and tempura.Finally, we board the train for the cool, dappled sanctuary of Hoshinoya Fuji, a “glamping” resort on a forested hillside overlooking Mount Fuji. (Rising early one morning I even manage to catch a rare cloudless image of Fuji San, as it’s known in these parts.) Japan apparently does not have much of a camping culture and frankly neither do I so the set-up suits me perfectly: modernist stone cabins with wide balconies where they will serve you breakfast first thing and, at night, light guttering fires.There are “cloud platforms”, huge decked areas stacked up the hillside, where we can lie drinking steaming cups of green tea. It is a much-needed restorative after the heat and the clamour and the ringing of bells and the flashing of video arcades and the general cultural overload. One day, Eddie announces, he wants to come back to Japan. Only next time, without his mum and dad.Sake For the definitive sake experience, head to Niigata and its remote island, Sado, where you can talk with master brewers and, crucially, drink a fair amount of it, too.

Jenna Coleman tells Elizabeth Day how these ‘brave’ women made her so much strongerThe other day Jenna Coleman gave birth for the seventh time. “I feel like my year has been literally maternity bras and pregnancy bumps,” she says over a cup of tea in acafénear her home in north London. “It’s becoming a parody now.” Before you start to worry about the medical anomaly that is Coleman’s uterus, rest assured it was all for the cameras. In real life, the 32-year-old Coleman has yet to have children: “I don’t know if the time is now for me,” she says. Onscreen, however, she has been through a long phase of playing mothers.She is in the middle of filming the third series of Victoria, the hit ITV drama scripted by Daisy Goodwin in which Coleman plays the titular queen, and “we’re up to the seventh child now, which is just ridiculous”. Victoria ultimately had nine so, she adds, “I’m not out of the woods yet.” And then there’s the forthcoming BBC psychological drama, The Cry, in which Coleman plays Joanna, a young mother in present-day Glasgow, struggling to adapt to the demands of her newborn. Coleman had to pretend to give birth for that as well, screaming and gripping on to the side of the hospital bed with bared teeth and a sweat-drenched face. It was very convincing, I say. “Oh was it?” Coleman asks. “Good.” In order to get into the zone before filming a labour scene, she listens to music by Mumford \u0026amp Sons. “There’s something about the banjo,” she explains. “I just try to get up a lot of adrenaline and for some reason the banjo and the drums, I think, help. I don’t know…” Has Coleman ever met her fellow actor, Carey Mulligan, who is married to the band’s frontman, Marcus Mumford? “No! Can you imagine if I did and said: ‘Your husband helps my labour scenes?’” It turns out that giving birth is only the start of the action in The Cry. The four-part series, adapted from the eponymous novel by Australian author Helen Fitzgerald, centres on a shocking tragedy that triggers Joanna’s psychological unravelling. In charting her mental disintegration, the drama seeks to expose the myths and unacknowledged truths of motherhood. It’s a compelling watch, but in a piece so focused on the complexities of being a parent, I wonder if Coleman ever worried about not having children herself. “Yeah. I spent a good first chunk of it just thinking they’d completely miscast – and why on earth me?” she replies. “I’m not a mother! I really kind of hit myself over the head with it. I felt there was obviously something I wouldn’t be able to capture. It was something so… well, primal that I haven’t literally experienced. And I’ve really struggled with that.” She emailed all her friends who had babies asking for insight, and received reams of information in return, “just the kind of day-to-day realities of what it is being a new mum…”It made her wonder about the “loss of identity” women face after giving birth and the way they are judged by society for wanting to maintain their own sense of self. She’s a real thinker, Coleman, and her conversation often drifts off into ellipsis as she tries to clarify a thought or an opinion. When she turns up, dressed in a long cardigan that seems to swamp her petite frame and pixie-shaped face, she appears nervous, and admits that this is her first interview for years.“I’ve been away working,” she says, worriedly, as if I might test her on the validity of her excuse. “There are so many pressures on women,” she continues, “to feel that motherhood is the most wonderful thing in the world and it is, absolutely, it’s precious and it’s beautiful, but that really doesn’t mean you can’t have these other things in your life and I think everyone needs to be a little bit more forgiving of mothers who don’t feel guilty for wanting a bit of independence still… I think we all seem to have so many standards on how it’s supposed to be and I think it’s toxic really.”In fact, Coleman has been thinking a lot about women lately – not just mothers, but about how we all find our place in a world where gender dynamics have been shifting under our feet. The rise of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movement in the wake of the scandal surrounding the disgraced movie mogul, Harvey Weinstein, has been “amazing… but I think the only way for that to really have impact is for those conversations to keep happening and those facts to keep on surfacing and just keep on going with it… It’s definitely made me feel less apologetic for myself.”In what way did she feel she had to apologise? Coleman blinks slowly and tilts her face downwards. “I think sometimes over the past couple of years, because I was young and female, there was definitely a feeling like I perhaps didn’t have as much right to an opinion.” I can see what she means. Coleman is in her 30s, and has been working solidly since the age of 18, when she got a part in the long-running TV soap Emmerdale (her character ended up killing a policeman with a chair leg and currently resides in prison), before being cast as the assistant in Doctor Who alongside Matt Smith, and later, Peter Capaldi, but she still looks much younger than her years. Her features are delicate, her manner shy, her stature slight. With her brown eyes and hair, she resembles a pretty woodland creature who is more comfortable building a nest out of leaves and twigs than having to talk to someone she’s just met. She likes reading (recently, she’s loved the Elena Ferrante Neapolitan novels and Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens). She strikes me as an introvert, who finds herself in a world of extroversion.Coleman says that when she first took on the part of Victoria two years ago, “I felt really young… I don’t think I’ve ever particularly been hugely aware of my height as such, or being female until really I was playing her. It’s that thing of power, I guess, and feeling like, ‘How do you play power? How do you project power? Do you just sit on a throne? What do you do?’The set “was an intimidating environment”, but because she was playing a character who faced the same issues – namely, how to make her voice heard in a roomful of older men. Coleman gradually learned how to “be brave enough” to say what she felt. In the end, Queen Victoria rubbed off on her. “I definitely feel a lot more comfortable now. And I’d say a lot of that is probably because of Victoria, I think.” She claims never to have experienced overt sexual harassment in the industry, but when she went out to Los Angeles at the age of 21 for auditions, “I was asked to turn up to an audition in a bikini and just said no. You know, there’s been silly things like that.”How aware is she of asking for equal pay in her roles? “It’s really hard for me because obviously the last couple of projects I’ve been doing, I’ve been in a comfortable position where I’ve been able to be strong… But the thing is, nobody talks. Nobody really knows and I think that’s why so much time has gone on where things have been allowed to happen.” Still, it’s not a massive stretch of the imagination to think that Coleman might, just might, have discussed pay with Tom Hughes, the actor who plays Prince Albert. The two of them, rumoured to have met on set, have been dating since 2016. If only you knew the guy who depicts your husband on screen, I joke, then you could ask him how much he gets paid.Coleman smiles and then blushes furiously. “If only,” she says, looking away, and that’s about all I can glean about the status of their relationship. “I feel like it’s a whole can of worms that’s potentially better not to open,” she explains. But she’s happy? “Oh God yes.”The couple recently moved house and Coleman is busy decorating. “I’ve been getting into interior design. I love the creative aspect. If you need to know anything about tiles or shades of white, I’m there.” Her father, Keith, fits the interiors of bars and restaurants for a living, so it clearly runs in the family. Her mother, Karen, “doesn’t work” and her brother Ben, older by three years, is a joiner. Coleman always knew she wanted to act. “I just used to constantly be playing and telling stories. I started going to the theatre when I was reallyyoung. It was always there, I guess. The trickier thing was working out how to turn it into a job. It was never really a question of…” she breaks off. “I just loved it. Really enjoyed it.”As a child, growing up in Blackpool, she was “a bit of a tomboy”. “I was just chasing my brother around. He told me the garden was full of eating-grass.” Did she eat the grass? “I did yeah,” she grins. “He tells me now it has prepared me for life.” At school, Coleman joined a theatre company and took plays to the Edinburgh fringe. While she was applying for drama school, a local agency put her forward for an Emmerdale audition. It was, she says, “a fluke” that she ended up getting the part but she did and, aged 18, moved to Leeds while all her friends were going to university. “I was like, ‘Bye Mum!’” Coleman says now. “I was ready to go.”Working on Emmerdale taught her a lot because “you work with a lot of different actors, a lot of different directors… It was a great training ground. I just knew I didn’t want to stay there forever.” She was also keen not to be typecast as a northern, working-class actor, being given roles involving downtrodden lives and abducted children, which was why, shortly after leaving Emmerdale in 2009, she chose to star as the privileged daughter of an industrial magnate in the BBC adaptation of John Braine’s 1957 novel, Room at the Top. “I don’t really enjoy playing myself at all,” Coleman says. “I love anything that feels more removed from myself. I have a lot more freedom… But using my own voice and being me? I feel self-conscious. If people ask me to do a speech or something, it’s like my worst nightmare. I can’t bear it.”It must be strange, given her dislike of drawing attention to herself off-screen, to find that she is now famous. The double-whammy of having starred in a long-running cult classic (Doctor Who) and a prime-time costume drama (Victoria) means she is frequently stopped in the street. “I can see if it’s a young boy, for example, I’ll know that’s Doctor Who. There’s a certain demographic,” she says. The Victoria fans tend to be older and, “I did get one person who asked, ‘Can I have a selfie, your majesty?’ in John Lewis, of all places!” I tell her this is quite possibly the most quintessentially middle-class anecdote I’ve ever heard. She laughs, but then worries it might sound as if she’s complaining. Her level of celebrity, she insists, does not make it feel as if her privacy is intruded upon. “I think if there’s ever a time I would feel that, it would be if somebody is knocking on your front door and invading your space. But I mean, no, I don’t think I could sit and complain about it.”She finishes her tea and slips her handbag strap across her shoulder. She has interior decorating to be getting on with and shades of white paint to pore over. She thinks she’s going to take some time off after The Cry airs and she’s finished filming Victoria. Over the past year, Coleman has been working so consistently that she’s spent a grand total of 12 nights at home. She wants to finish the decoration and then go travelling. “I’ve never been to India or Marrakech,” she says dreamily. “I’d like to go somewhere with colours – maybe Cuba. Pick my camera back up. Go and have a bit of Jenna life.” And, presumably, take off the pregnancy bump – at least for a while.The Cry is coming soon to BBC1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adc82d56ae41e6d7aab1fa3e4ecca2900436549c/0_279_4285_2570/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ff9b224ab1fb80300d179370ffd45b9","title":"star black earth rising education 1994 wanda genocide","story":"Hugo Blick makes a habit of writing and directing television that has serious, high-minded ambition to elevate the form and educate his audience. Black Earth Rising, a drama about the prosecution of international war crimes – specifically the Rwandan genocide – is no exception.Co-produced by the BBC and Netflix, the first episode aired last week to a string of five-star reviews and 1.1 million viewers. It is an impressive share of the Monday night audience, all the more considering the complex nature of the story that tries to unravel mainstream perceptions of “Africa”.“It doesn’t rest at the genocide,” says Blick. “It takes genocide as its ignition point for injustices that are still outstanding on both sides of this equation. This is not just about the Hutu and Tutsi it’s also about the west.”Blick and his star, Michaela Coel, arrive at the BBC to noisy reverence Black Earth Rising is among the autumn’s most expensive flagship shows. Blick says it takes square aim at the hypocrisies of the international criminal court and at what he says is a lack of knowledge of a massacre that saw an estimated million people murdered in 100 days. “It was the most intensive ethnic slaughter in the 20th century,” says Blick. “I am very concerned that people aren’t aware.”Having established the premise last week – centred on the Rwandan refugee and criminal investigator Kate Ashby (Coel) – through some hefty exposition, Monday night’s episode is set to zip the audience through the atrocities of the recent past. The show is designed to be talked about and, in turn, spotlight the events and consequence of the 1994 genocide.“So much comes up on our Twitter feeds,” says Coel. “There is stuff and outrage about wars and history. But why didn’t we hear about this? Why didn’t I know?” Did she really know nothing about Africa’s recent history? She shrugs and admits: “It’s a long time for it not to come on to my radar.”Coel, 30, grew up on an estate in London and made her name with Chewing Gum, her self-penned, Bafta-winning E4 sitcom. This show has delivered her first dramatic role, her first visit to Ghana (where Black Earth Rising was filmed and where, incidentally, Coel’s father and extended family live) and her first exposure to the conflict in Rwanda and the subsequent Congo wars.To her and Blick, the erasure of these conflicts is appalling. “I know British history, I know American history,” says Coel. Anything she has learned since “is not because of schooling,” says Blick. Coel’s research – which took in reading Tim Butcher’s Blood River and Stephen Kinzer’s A Thousand Hills – and the 128-day shoot, she says, changed her life. “I went to a Catholic school for my secondary school and there just wasn’t a curiosity there. I am curious now. I am learning.”She has been back to Ghana twice since the shoot ended.Still, for all the acclaim and buzz on social media about the show, Coel does not believe her generation are as woke as they claim. “Come on now, no, no, no. They have a Twitter feed, which taught them ‘#woke’. But that isn’t African history. That isn’t even our history, it isn’t the real British history. We’re not taught that and it means we grow up not caring and seeing everything else as being kept in separate boxes.” She turns to Blick. “That means we get to a place where we say: ‘How can you tell that story? You’re not African.’”Blick is well aware that stories about Africa are often told through the lens of white western men like him and that a continent of 54 countries can often be reduced to narrow stereotype and cliche. “One has agency to pursue the truth regardless,” he says. “Am I responsible for institutional racism?”Coel nods. “I’ve never heard it put like that before. Because you do hear people go, ‘How could a white man tell that story?’ But do you need to be the same race as the stories you report?”Both Cole and Blick are prized talents for the corporation he has already delivered acclaimed hits such as The Shadow Line (a London-set murder thriller) and The Honourable Woman (a political thriller set against the Israeli-Palestinian conflict). And she has been signed up by the BBC to write a drama about sexual consent.Last month, Coel stunned the audience at the Edinburgh TV festival by delivering the keynote MacTaggart lecture in which she revealed the racism and sexual assault she had suffered while working in the industry. Her account was searing and honest about the way she had been treated by peers and production companies and reportedly brought audible gasps from the audience.Did she worry about damaging her career or finding work again? Blick jumps in. “I’d hire her again,” he says, as Coel plays down the aftermath with a fixed smile. “I was honestly not really in radio contact,” she says. I just felt really glad and very happy. I would just hope that people get to see the whole story and not just snippets.”One of Rwanda’s most prominent opposition leaders walked free from jail on Saturday after the government approved the early release of more than 2,100 prisoners with little explanation.Victoire Ingabire’s release surprised many in the capital, Kigali, as it is unusual for the longtime president, Paul Kagame, to pardon potential challengers. She quickly urged Kagame to release all other political prisoners.Ingabire, head of the opposition FDU-Inkingi party, was arrested in 2010 and found guilty of conspiracy to undermine the government and denying Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, charges that she denied. She was sentenced to 15 years.Human Rights Watch, which has expressed concern that the government uses accusations of “genocide ideology” as a way to silence critics, called the charges politically motivated.Ingabire had criticised the government ahead of the 2010 presidential election.Rwanda’s government has long been accused by rights groups of suppressing the opposition and having a justice system that lacks independence.

That was before the announcement last week by Levi Strauss \u0026amp Co, the 165-year-old denim company, of a partnership with Everytown for Gun Safety and other gun violence prevention groups.“While taking a stand can be unpopular with some, doing nothing is no longer an option,” the Levi’s chief executive, Chip Bergh, wrote. “Business has a critical role to play and a moral obligation to do something.”The National Rifle Association scoffed, declaring “a particularly sad episode in the current surge in corporate virtue-signaling”.“We can only assume that Levi’s accountants have determined that resulting skinny jeans sales will be enough to offset the permanent damage to their once-cherished brand,” the gun lobbyists said.The Levi’s move did not have the markings of a purely venal business play: Bergh, a former US army captain, has spoken out about guns before. But with Nike unveiling Colin Kaepernick as its latest spokesman the same week, and a startling wave of brands taking stands on issues they might previously have shunned, the NRA accusation had bite. Is this new brand bravery for real? And if so, what’s driving it?As consumers are roiled by Facebook fights and riven by mistrust in Donald Trump’s America, corporations have confronted the old question – of how to move product – with sometimes experimental answers, analysts say, and deeply mixed results.“More and more, consumers are looking for brands that stand for something and take a position, so that they can make a decision for themselves if that represents their identity and their values,” said Todd Fischer, a senior vice-president at GMR Marketing, a global agency. “Brands have been pulled deeper into the conversation.”But that conversation comes with risks and corporations sometimes get it wrong. The roll call of shame is topped by Pepsi, which in spring 2017 released an ad in which Kendall Jenner, the millennial model, led a group of (very handsome) protesters evoking the Black Lives Matter movement in a showdown with (very handsome) police. The standoff was resolved by a shared soda.What was Pepsi thinking? Corporations in general are under increasing pressure to “take a stand in ways that go beyond the generic corporate social responsibility platitudes they used to be able to sort of hide behind,” said Michael Serazio, a professor of communications at Boston College.“We’ve evolved to a point in branding history where consumers purchase things not because of their utility but because of what it signals to other people in their social milieu. What you’ve seen over the last couple of years is this trend toward corporations taking more specific and more controversial political stances.”Many other corporations have dared to tread where Pepsi stumbled. Yuengling, the Pennsylvania brewery, endorsed Trump for president Patagonia, the California-based clothier, sued Trump for annulling public lands Delta Airlines and REI, the gear store, came out in favor of gun control Adidas stood behind Kanye West, the inventor of the brand’s best-selling Yeezy shoe line, after his controversial statements about slavery and Trump. Burger King, meanwhile, made a Whopper commercial about net neutrality, and after Trump was elected, Heineken staged an excruciating series of conversations between strangers to assert “there’s more that unites than ides us”.With its recruitment of Kaepernick as spokesman, Nike seemed to go even further. As a leader of the movement among National Football League players to kneel during the national anthem to protest about police violence against people of color, the formerly star quarterback found himself ostracized by the league and attacked personally by Trump, starting when Trump was still a candidate.Featuring star athletes and others who have overcome various forms of adversity to become champions, the new Nike ad is narrated by Kaepernick and finishes with the tagline: “Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.” The line induces either chills or nausea, depending on your tolerance for corporate plays at poignancy. It appeared to find the mark with consumers, Nike’s stock touching an all-time high on Thursday.Trump, for one, thought the ad did not work.“What was Nike thinking?” he tweeted.Patrick Rishe, a professor who interviewed 50 people in sports marketing and media for his recent book They Shoot … They Score, said the company had obviously done its research and was thinking it was going to sell shoes.“The messages that these companies are getting from their market research with millennials and Gen Z consumers is these people want their brands to be authentic, they want them to be culturally relevant, they have to be digital,” Rishe said.“Younger folks want brands to stand for something. ‘I don’t want to just see your logo. You’re just trying to sell me some shoes or shirts. I want you to stand for something.’ And when you take that leap of faith as a company, you are running risks.”America’s social and economic isions predate Trump. But as a candidate and now as president, he clearly comprehends what corporations have also realized: taking definitive stands on isive issues may alienate some people but it also inspires loyalty.Trump understands that he can make a stronger connection with consumers – ie: voters – if he does not restrict the conversation to products or to policies. Instead of immigration, he talks about gang violence. Instead of Russian cyber-attacks, he talks about Hillary Clinton. Instead of criminal justice reform, he talks about football.It might not make sense for someone with urgent personal healthcare needs to vote for Trump based on a shared opinion about Kaepernick, just like it might not make sense for people to buy shoes because they admire Kaepernick. But it works.“The point of branding is to make a corporation into a human being,” said Serazio. “And that is fundamentally ridiculous. And yet that is the basis of our advertising, contemporary consumer culture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77aa3e5ef9ebaff7a6b14c6c11ee04537dfe7d13/0_88_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b72009dc9be2b92e501a4fd33aea47b","title":"return to refugee camps 30 years on dina nayeri","story":"Dina Nayeri was eight when she and her family fled Iran. Are today’s refugees treated with more dignity?There have been days, months, when I’ve eaten meals provided by charities, governments, good people. When I was 10, I lived in a refugee camp outside Rome, a temporary safe space for transients seeking asylum outside Italy. The Italian government had leased the building from a hotel owner though our clothes and sheets were those of refugees, we lived on a hilltop, in the husk of a pretty hotel.Each day, the residents of hotel Barba were served soup, pasta, coffee, meat, bread. In the mornings, we stampeded for jam. We were given three meals at precise times. When my mother found an English school an hour away by bus, we had to find a way to claim our lunches or they would be lost. She enlisted the help of an Afghan grandmother – she would save our lunches for us, we would eat them for dinner, then we would make sandwiches out of our dinners, hang them in a plastic bag over a balcony and take them to school the next day. The process was embarrassing and very visible. The bringing in of the lunches, now cold, to the canteen at dinner time, the packing away of the fresher dinners. The hotel served hard, round bread rolls and we filled them with peas and mashed potatoes, with pasta and chicken, slices of meat under carrot, letting the gravy soak and soften the bread overnight. To this day, leftover sandwiches evoke survival for me – they bring dread, the pleasure of having solved a puzzle, and also shame.A few years later, after my family had been granted asylum and sent to Oklahoma and I fancied myself an American teenager, I began volunteering at a local food bank. My friend and I were assigned to the storeroom. Poor mothers or single men would arrive in the front, sign in at the desk, tell their stories to more experienced volunteers, and we, the teenagers in the back, would receive instruction about which category of grocery bundle to make. Everyone got the same things, with a few extras for babies and some substitutions for allergies. They never saw our faces, the silly adolescents who flirted and sang while we chose their food: tuna or chicken, white or wheat, pulp or no pulp. I got rid of all the chunky peanut butter first, thinking I was being kind. I was grateful that I didn’t see their faces, that I could avoid the downcast eyes as I loaded their bags into open trunks.Accepting charity is an ugly business for the spirit. It rubs you raw, especially if you were once someone with pride and lofty goals, someone who shook hands and locked eyes. My mother and I used to talk about the irony of so many of the world’s refugees coming from the Middle East – we are such prideful people, and a refugee is the most abject creature of all: stateless, homeless, without control over her own food, education or health. Asylum seekers is so mild a phrase – we weren’t politely seeking, we were ravenous for it, this animal need for safety for our bodies. How do we survive the memory of it?After Oklahoma, I spent two decades working on my pride. I accepted no charity from friends. When we went out, I ate little. When one of their parents paid, it felt like a big deal, as if I had lost control. I didn’t borrow change for vending machines. I did accept the charity of universities, as it was hidden from view and kinder. Later on, I allowed men to pay for meals, telling myself that my company was enough to compensate – that this is how the world’s least indebted women behave and so should I.In my 30s in New York, I volunteered to help a friend, a well-meaning finance type, serve Thanksgiving dinner at a homeless shelter. I showed up in a stained T-shirt and old jeans, my hair in a ratty bun. There was no question of what to wear I knew that tonight I would offer food to a stranger, and that stranger would, for a moment, be humiliated. She would look at my clothes, my posture, for a reason to say: “Who cares what she thinks?” And it was part of my job to give her that reason quickly. I remembered that at hotel Barba, a young man serving soup would call out: “Zuppa! Zuppa!” He’d make a clown of himself, so we could laugh sometimes, he would sit for a chat, eat some soup, ask how we were. The zuppa man was beloved at hotel Barba and I imagined myself in his shoes. I stuck $10 in my pocket, leaving my wallet behind.But Manhattan do-gooders don’t know the quiet bargains that the poor make in the space of a glance. When I arrived at the shelter, my friend looked me up and down. “Are you depressed?” he joked, eyeing my stains. Behind him, bankers and lawyers in Chanel shoes and white silk shirts, leather handbags still on their arms, dished out mashed potatoes and uneasy smiles to tired men and women wearing the grime of the city. Later on, when the residents invited the volunteers to join their table (a plea for dignity), the volunteers declined out of concern (“Will there be enough?”). They dashed off to a fancy restaurant instead, ordered pork belly and congratulated themselves for not staying (“It would’ve been overstepping”), then complained about the tourists crowding the door. I confess that I ate a few bites of that turkey dinner, and I ate the pork belly, too, and I let my friend pay, humiliating as it was given my stained T-shirt, my sweaty hair. I hated him that night, but I was also grateful to be in his company. I went home and threw it all up.Now, a few more years have passed. I’m a writer in London, a mother, a confused immigrant. A lifelong chameleon, I’m reimagining my identity again. Am I still a refugee after so many years of assimilating?I spend a lot of time thinking about hotel Barba. In 2011, I went back. It had become a proper hotel, with pretty curtains and nice sheets. I know now that Barba was a “low hardship” camp. I hate that term. It’s condescending and a lie. The accurate description is that it was something other than hell. It wasn’t Moria in Lesbos, with its raw sewage and midnight wars, its five-hour food lines and shared tents on open soil. Officially, hotel Barba was a refugee camp. But I call it a hostel, because it wasn’t a camp. It wasn’t a hotel, either. The difference between each pair of words is subtle, a private calculation of shame and place and dignity.Late last autumn in a London cafe, I spoke with Paul Hutchings about life in the camps and the possibility of my returning to one. He co-founded Refugee Support, a charity that goes from camp to camp revamping the way they distribute aid. Right away, he started up about dignity and shame. Like me, he had stayed up nights thinking about humiliation. Hutchings met John Sloan in October 2015 while volunteering in the Calais camp. The two men noticed that the act of offering food and clothing, these undeniably first-order needs, had become so urgent and frantic that the “how” was forgotten. The only people who seemed aware were the refugees Hutchings saw it in their eyes, in their gait. Though they had already lost so much, they were losing more with every jacket tossed from a truck-bed and every ill-fitting pair of trousers they would have to barter away. In Calais, provisions were handed out from the backs of vans. One day, a van would arrive with, say, large jackets and park in one part of the camp. Another day, a different van with men’s jeans, or T-shirts, would park in another corner. Refugees lined up as a volunteer tried to keep order, and another asked their size. They received one item and were asked to go. Some tried to negotiate, claiming to have a sick friend, a parent too weak to stand in line. Others fought and yelled and grabbed. Items were trampled on the ground. Some went away empty-handed. No one felt good about what had just happened.“Wouldn’t it be nice,” said Hutchings in the cafe, “if we could give people food and clothing without taking away their dignity?”“Why is that so hard?” I asked.“Because people want every hour and dollar they give to be stretched thin.” Hutchings told me that his biggest problem was the volunteers, donors, and their lofty expectations. Many donors want to assign criteria to how their food is given out. They want their money feeding as many as possible, to make sure you spend it only on eggs and bread. They want to police. They don’t care about the “how”. Even the most good-hearted volunteers want to feel thanked. Refugee Support began its work in April 2016 at Alexandreia camp near Thessaloniki, Greece. They set out to open a food store, then a clothing store, a well-designed, peaceful marketplace stocked with donations, where a person of note wouldn’t be ashamed to shop. When Hutchings showed me photographs, I thought: my mother, an Iranian doctor, would shop there. My grandfather, a landowner, would be proud to run into a neighbour there. It was a far cry from the item-specific trucks.At first, residents made appointments and collected prepared baskets of food, thoughtfully arranged with necessities for each family. Everyone received the same thing, regardless of allergies, habits or taste. But people didn’t have the same needs, and soon there were grumblings, barter, waste.Hutchings and Sloan decided to display the goods and give people the respect of choosing for themselves. The store’s currency would be points distributed weekly like income – 100 points per adult, 50 per child, 150 for pregnant women. Store prices would be pegged to market prices (20 points per euro). Sanitary items would be free. If residents wanted to spend all their points on chocolate spread, they had that right.On his phone, Hutchings showed me designs for Katsikas, the newest camp, near Ioannina, closer to the Albanian border than to Athens. He spends time thinking of the aesthetics, whether people will like it – he cares that they like it. He has sales data, too, and a list of what he needs to stock each week. Yes, the customers (his word) buy some butter biscuits, but they don’t sacrifice milk for it.“You know what I love?” Hutchings asked. “When they complain about the selection. Because that means they’ve forgotten they’re in a camp. They’re just people in a store, with money in hand, complaining about yoghurt.”“I want to go,” I said.“We have rules,” he said, “We need to keep absolute equality between people, so there’s no hint of special treatment. We don’t allow socialising or friendships. Volunteers can’t even accept a cup of tea or enter the private rooms.”“Are there Iranians there?” I asked. “Or Afghans who speak Farsi?”“There will be at Katsikas when it opens,” he said.“I want to go without your rule,” I said, thinking of that long-ago turkey dinner that everyone turned down. If this is about pride, I have to be able to accept a cup of tea.“The complicated thing is that dignity changes as different needs are met,” Hutchings told me a few weeks later, as we drove on a pitch-black highway, slick with rain, away from Athens. “When you arrive from Lesbos, dirty, tired, starving, dignity is that package of shampoo, deodorant, eggs, coffee, bread. So we offer that on arrival. Then, when you’ve showered and slept and cleaned up, that package becomes humiliating. You want your tea, not coffee. You remember you hate eggs. That’s when you want choice. After you’ve lived in a camp for a few months, the store with fake money and strict friendship rules becomes humiliating, too. Why can’t you befriend the clerk? There’s a shelf-life to this. We don’t stay at any camp because we don’t want to contribute to the camp becoming permanent.” We were visiting two camps on this trip, but our ultimate destination was Katsikas. I had put on a brave, eager face, but I was afraid of what I would see and remember.Just before Christmas 2017, 450 refugees from 10 countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iran and Iraq, arrived at the empty camp at Katsikas. Awaiting them were Isoboxes, residential containers in a gated field, each kitted out with kitchenette and bathroom, beds on metal frames. Almost everyone was arriving from Moria, the hell in Lesbos, and from similar inhospitable camps on the islands. The store staff prepared for opening day. No one expected chaos they knew that when you grant people dignity, they become dignified. The refugees walk through the store, looking they choose olive or sunflower oil, the one they prefer. They are treated as the doctors and teachers and craftsmen they once were.On my first day, the store opened as usual, 10.30am until 1pm. It was clean and whimsically decorated, with cheese graters as light fixtures, little plants here and there, vegetables neatly piled in rows. It looked like a food cooperative in south London. An iPad served as the sole point of sale, though later a second “register” was added with pad and paper. Behind the produce was the storeroom, left open so volunteers could fetch nappies and extra bags. No one worried about theft. Outside, a long hallway featured art by camp residents, including a haunting sketch of a laden boat at night, refugees on open water. Tables and chairs were set up where families waited their turn. Here was the first difference between this store and any other: only one family could shop at a time.Another point of difference: no one, no matter how compelling their story, ever gets an exception. On my second afternoon in the store, a young couple, newly pregnant, came back after their shop. The husband said he counted the items and it came up 50 short. Nothing could be done. “It’s not about the inidual,” Hutchings said. There could be no whiff of case-by-case judgments, or the possibility of favouritism, on the camp.For most of my time at the store, I bagged groceries, just as I did in Oklahoma. This time, I had no say in what went into the bags. But after the second family passed through, I noticed other peculiarities of this store: in a way, we did tell them what they could have, because we controlled the points. The envelope full of paper money is largely symbolic, since almost everyone spends all that they have on the first market day after the points are issued. They hand over the entire envelope and the volunteer keeps track of their shopping. At some point the volunteer says, “Only 10 left” or, “You’re 10 over”, and the family begins to make trade-offs. Private discussions are had. Children jump in, biting their nails. Juice boxes are sacrificed.The first time this happened, I realised I had bagged too soon. I had been over-zealous. I had to stop, wait to see what would be put back. I had bagged the children’s bananas, and now I remembered how rare bananas were in Iran, how desperate I had been for them and how that desperation lasted all through my teenage years, after bananas became ordinary. I wanted to ask Hutchings if we could just let them have it, but stood by, feeling useless and ham-fisted as the parents explained that the bananas would have to go back.Later on, as a young Syrian mother and I were trying to arrange her six sacks in a chubbily occupied buggy – the baby leaning forward, accustomed to sharing his space – I heard the familiar, easy sounds of Farsi. An older Iranian couple entered, handing over their envelope (200 points, no children). I listened as they spoke in the language of everyday shopping. “How much” is this or that? “Is the olive oil worth the price?” It was beautiful to enter this brief fantasy. For 10 minutes, they were a couple in some European city, doing their weekend shopping.Then they went 10 points over. The wife bit her lip. “We have to put the biscuits back,” she said.The husband scanned the items.“But we’d be five under.” I imagined them back in their Isobox with their cups of tea, the cardamom they had smuggled from Iran. Butter cookies are just the thing with tea.They took a tomato paste and stood at the register.Then I did something stupid: I said hello in Farsi, wished them a good day. They stared at me, stunned, said polite hellos. I realised I had punctured that brief fantasy of a normal life that Hutchings had envisioned perhaps this was the reason for the no chit-chat rule. The fact that I had understood their private negotiations made plain that they were part of a charade, that this was a charity shop. I begged the universe to rewind by five seconds, to make it so I wasn’t the same as those Thanksgiving volunteers in New York, the ones whose help had come at such high costs.I started bagging their things and, for a second time in my life, was glad for having dressed shabbily.When the store was closed, I walked through the rows of Isoboxes, knocking on doors. It was intimidating and thrilling. Again, I asked myself, what the hell am I doing? Who would answer? Would they speak Farsi? Would they invite me in? I memorised the door numbers for the Farsi households.A kind couple in their 30s opened the first door. I had found them through their daughters, who were playing soccer outside. I’d heard delighted shrieks in the language of my own childhood, and made a beeline for the sound. “Are you police?” the older girl asked. “No, I’m an Iranian lady looking for other Iranians.” She gave me their Isobox number. The parents invited me in. Hutchings sat with us, happy to listen without understanding as they told us the story of their escape. After several hours, the talk turned to the store and they said something I would hear from every other Iranian at Katsikas: get basmati rice. They pulled out the rice from the store, then the rice they had bought with their own money. The husband compared the grains. “See how much longer?” Hutchings nodded. It was simply that a volunteer had found a good deal on this rice. “Can I come back tomorrow?” I asked the couple. “Yes,” the husband said. “Actually, you will come back thrice. Things always happen to us in threes. Three boats before Moria. Three tries before getting here. Always three.”Before we left, they showed us videos of Moria, toilets overrun by sewage where people also bathed, tents on raw earth, children begging to leave. The husband asked for help with the immigration process. I didn’t know what to say – the photos were scenes from a nightmare, and I felt so obtuse for having revealed my own asylum story. Hutchings kept his face neutral. “I’m sorry, we can’t help. We don’t know asylum law. Yes, we’ll look into the basmati.” Later, he told me that it’s a mistake even to provide reassurance, because the residents grasp at every hope. The videos and pleas for help happened in every Isobox I visited.By now, we are accustomed to horrifying footage from refugee camps. We forget the psychological damage of purgatory. This waiting space, in which you can never go back to your old life and identity, but haven’t been told yet what your new one will be. Will your children have to learn German, Italian or English? Will you work in your old profession again? Will 2030 find you lecturing in a university again, or driving an Uber, washing dishes, cleaning homes with a fraction of the books you once owned? These questions torture the mind, yet the world says: “They made it out! They’re safe. We did it!” Then they toss food out of truck beds, provide shelter in tents. But charity and welcome are different things.The next day, I knocked on a door and found a group of women having tea and rolling dough. They were Afghans and Iranians, and immediately they called me inside. They had heard about me. They gave me tea. I made myself comfortable on a pillow between two motherly ones. They had an old pasta maker acquired in Ioannina and were turning all their flour into pasta. They pointed to a small room where thin ropes of dough were drying on a bedframe, the mattress stashed away somewhere. “This is for Iranian noodle soup,” said one of them. “We’re making enough for everyone.” The women told me that every night they got together in someone’s Isobox for prayer and dinner. I promised to join them. Later that night, I found the same group, with their daughters and granddaughters, including one who had been born in the camp, having a birthday party, dancing and cheering.Before we arrived at Katsikas, Hutchings and I had stopped at LM village, near Kilini, a camp that Refugee Support had just left. Perhaps it was better for me to see the ghost of the store before I saw the living one. I wanted to go there because it was built in the carcass of an old holiday village, much like Barba. I hoped that it would rub away my calluses and I’d regain something of those days. Hutchings’ store was a shambles, clothes trampled on the floor, children rummaging through, a Greek worker on her phone, oblivious. Hutchings walked through the wreck of the store he had built, shaking his head, his shoulders dropping.The commander of the camp followed us around, nervous. He thought that Sloan and Hutchings had left because of his behaviour and he was trying to appease. They hadn’t, of course. But he was a fiery sort, and when Refugee Support left, the refugees barred the gates in protest, thinking the commander had shut the store down. He turned to me as we walked: “Dina, when you’re in the car, tell him every 20 minutes to come back to LM.” He was silent for a while, then said: “Tell him every 10 minutes to come back.”Hutchings didn’t respond. He seemed to be working through larger questions. Was his hard work gone? Did the refugees carry it away with them, their spirits stronger now?At LM, we ate with a Syrian family. The commander joined us. We couldn’t bear to touch the meagre food, knowing it had been bought with precious euros. But the family had refused to let us go the elderly mother of 10 grabbed my backpack and held it to her breast. We would have insulted them. This wasn’t like that New York Thanksgiving: they needed this food. Nevertheless, pride wins over hunger and we stayed.On my last day in Greece, as the store was closing and I was saying my goodbyes, a bewildered man in his mid-40s wandered into the waiting area. I could tell by his face he was Iranian. I greeted him in Farsi and he looked relieved. He said he had just arrived. He had no clothes, no food. He wasn’t registered at the store yet. The volunteers looked at his papers and agreed to keep the store open so he could shop. They told him to return at 3pm and they would open the men’s clothing store so he could have his 10 items. He was larger than average. I hoped he would find something.Since he knew nothing of the point system, I helped him choose his food. He got eggs, rice, a kilo of bananas, oil. Then he put back the oil. He got cookies and pistachios, milk. He put back the milk. He didn’t get much else. As his last 20 points wouldn’t buy oil, he bought four juice boxes instead. He left happy, nodding his thanks to everyone.As I started for the car, I thought of how nervous I had been to revisit this strange waiting place, this limbo that had shaped me, that was now shaping thousands of others from my home. We would be for ever linked and defined by it. And how much I had forgotten that was now clear and urgent. I remembered something else. I ran back into the camp, found a door and knocked. I had knocked on this door twice already. Yesterday, the husband had said, “No need for goodbye. Remember? Everything happens in threes.” Now I stood at that family’s doorstep a third time, waiting to be invited in. No one answered. A neighbour poked a head out and said: “They’re out. Maybe playing football.”“OK,” I said, “I guess I have to come back then.”“Next time in England,” she said, as she receded behind a makeshift curtain, and I recalled that we used to say that, too.• Dina Nayeri’s book The Ungrateful Refugee will be published next year by Canongate.Commenting on this piece?

Those still alive declined to comment, NRC said.Meanwhile in France, a priest has been charged with sexually abusing four brothers, now aged from three to 17, his lawyer said.The family brought the complaint against the 64-year-old priest, whose parish is in the central Cantal region. All four boys were said to be in the church choir.The lawyer, Komine Bocoum, did not say when the alleged offences were said to have taken place.Local bishop Bruno Grua said his diocese was “shocked by these unspeakable acts”.They are the latest in a slew of assault allegations against the Catholic church ning several continents.People in Australia, Europe, and North and South America have charged they were sexually abused by clergymen and lay people, in what German Archbishop Georg Gaenswein has called the church’s “own 911”.In August, Pope Francis declined to comment on a claim that he ignored sexual abuse allegations against a senior clergyman in the US.On Wednesday, the German Catholic church said it was it was “dismayed and ashamed” by decades of alleged child sex abuse by priests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce53c75fbea2e9604e8b754cbe336706abf7790/0_93_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41ad45f3f255330cab062aaef606901a","title":"united ireland brexit irish unification back on agenda","story":"To sense true yearning for a united Ireland in Dublin you used to have to run your fingers over words written long ago and etched in cold, grey stone. “No man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation. No man has a right to say to his country: ‘Thus far shalt thou go and no further’.”So declared Charles Stewart Parnell in 1885 in an exhortation engraved in his granite monument on O’Connell Street. Quotes pining for nationhood from other nationalist leaders adorn similar monuments around the city.Most predate Ireland’s partition in 1922 but they resonated as aspirations to unite the 26-county south with the six counties of Northern Ireland – aspirations which southerners, as decades passed, espoused with dwindling conviction. There were other priorities: emigration, jobs, the economy, the health service. And in any case a united Ireland was never going to happen.Until it was.These days you open a newspaper, turn on the television, perch on a bar stool and the topic bubbles up not as history but as a looming existential choice, the forsaken dream dusted off and glimmering as possible – even inevitable.“It’s like a ball or boulder coming down the hill. You can’t stop it,” said Osgur Breatnach, an author and political activist at a book-reading in south county Dublin. “Agree with it or not, it’s going to happen.”Drinkers in the Pádraig Pearse, an inner city pub and republican haunt named after one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter rising, cheered the prospect. “A united republic of Ireland – I’d love it,” said Jamie Dean, 60, a labourer. “We’d be the same country. Not the Brits. It’s ours. So simple.”It’s not simple.Northern Ireland Unionists and Protestants who consider themselves British recoil at the idea of a United Ireland. Plenty of Catholics north and south have their own reservations, not least the financial cost, adding up to a fraught, complex tangle of identity, ideology and economics.But a confluence of events has shunted unification on to the political agenda.A plan unveiled last week by the European Research Group – the hard Brexit faction of the Conservative party – failed to assuage anxiety over whether a hard or soft border will descend on the porous 310-mile boundary of fields, roads and towns.Being bounced out of the EU to an uncertain fate has prompted one in six Northern Ireland voters to switch allegiance, delivering a majority for unification, according to a recent poll. “The possibility is no longer a pipe dream,” said Tommy McKearney, 66, a former IRA member and hunger striker. “I don’t think it’s imminent. It’ll be over the next 20 to 30 years – in a lifetime, but not in my lifetime.”“It’s a massive demographic shift. In five to 10 years there’ll be a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland,” said Peter Shirlow, director of the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Irish Studies. It will take longer for those numbers to translate into the electorate. “But a majority for a united Ireland is going to happen, no doubt about that.”Some unionists are overturning taboos by openly questioning the endurance and even desirability of the union with Britain.The “battle for the union is on”, Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland’s former first minister, and former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, recently warned. Unionists need to prepare for a border poll, he said: “I don’t expect my own house to burn down, but I still insure it because it could happen.” Unionists, in other words, need to act before the demographic clock ticks to midnight by selling the union’s merits to moderate nationalists and those who consider themselves neither unionist nor nationalist. Brexit, and unionist clumsiness in wooing allies, may immolate such insurance.A trickle of other prominent unionists such as Alex Kane, Mike Nesbitt and Jim Dornan have joined Robinson in sounding the alarm.Under the Good Friday agreement, the Northern Ireland secretary should call a border poll if he or she thinks a majority would vote for unification.The current secretary, Karen Bradley, did not help the union’s case this month by admitting that when appointed to the job she was “slightly scared” of Northern Ireland and profoundly ignorant about its political isions.Reaction on the streets of Belfast was scornful. “The government in Westminster doesn’t give a damn about us,” said Tom Neill, 72, a former soldier. “We’re a stepping stone here, politicians drop in, then leave,” said Anthony Quinn, 55, a film location manager.A spate of anniversaries underscores a sense that eras end, new ones begin, history advances. It is 20 years since the Good Friday agreement cemented republican and loyalist ceasefires with a power-sharing government in Stormont. Next year it is 50 years since the Troubles erupted, three decades of strife which claimed more than 3,500 lives.Further back, in October it will be 700 years since Edward Bruce, the last high king of Ireland, was defeated at the battle of Faughart and had his head delivered to King Edward II, marking an end to efforts to unite Gaelic Ireland.When British royals visit Ireland these days they receive hugs. The rebellious colony of uprisings, famine and resentment is now a prosperous, confident republic which no longer defines its identity in opposition to Britishness. Adoring crowds mobbed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in Dublin in July, a sequel to the Queen’s groundbreaking visit in 2011. Pope Francis, in contrast, spent much of his visit last month apologising for clerical sex abuse.All changed, changed utterly, as Yeats said.A country once viewed as an economic basket case and Catholic theocracy is now the EU’s star performer and a secular, progressive beacon with a gay taoiseach, marriage equality and relaxed abortion laws.In the Pádraig Pearse pub you still find a gate from Kilmainham jail, in honour of the 1916 rebels executed in the prison, but this part of Dublin is transformed, with dank slums giving way to sleek apartments and cafes serving organic avocado toast to Facebook and Google employees.The republic’s new Garda commissioner is Drew Harris, OBE, a veteran of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and its predecessor, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which republicans branded a unionist jackboot. The switch in allegiance stirred little controversy.Nor is there any outcry over Fianna Fail, one of the Republic’s biggest political parties, preparing to become an all-Ireland party by absorbing the SDLP, the north’s moderate nationalist party.Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA during the Troubles, is pushing for a border poll while trying to ease the sting for unionists. A draft document entitled Irish Unity – An Activist’s Guide floats changing the Irish flag and anthem. The party’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has suggested rejoining the Commonwealth.Meanwhile her predecessor, Gerry Adams, a bogeyman for unionists, is cultivating a quirkier persona. His latest initiative: a cookery book with recipes which sustained republicans during marathon peace negotiations. The puns have flowed: “give peas a chance”, “shinner of beef”, “when hunger strikes”.Unity is coming, said Danny Morrison, a writer and former IRA member and Sinn Fein publicity director. “In socioeconomic terms it makes sense. A majority is emerging that will favour radical change.”Unionists – if they engaged – could shape the process from a position of strength, he said: “They’re not under duress, they’re not being bombed into it by the IRA.” The new dispensation could be fluid for instance, an interim phase could keep Stormont and not force unionists to sit in a Dublin parliament.Unionists with business, farming and fishing interests would be pragmatic if a united Ireland was the only way to remain in the EU, said Morrison. “They’re willing to adapt to that,” he said.All-Ireland sports act as a bridge, especially when teams do well, such as last month when the women’s hockey team advanced to the World Cup finals, casting a feelgood glow over the whole island.“It’s now an evidence-based proposition,” said Kevin Meagher, a former Labour adviser on Northern Irelandand author of A United Ireland: Why Unification is Inevitable and How it Will Come About. “There’s a very good utilitarian argument. And it’s now harder to rally against the south as a bogeyman.” British politics will not lament Northern Ireland’s exit from the UK, said Meaghar: “There will be an audible sigh of relief.” It could all add up to a new era – an island re-united belting out Four Green Fields, the folk song about a lost province. But this scenario has a problem.“It’s a load of steaming bollocks. The Orangemen, for starters, won’t be budging.” The speaker is a plasterer called Michael, sipping cider in the Pádraig Pearse.Many agree with this assessment, albeit with less colourful language. A chorus of politicians, academics, pollsters and even republicans say Brexit’s impact on unionism is overstated and that a united Ireland will not happen soon, if ever.One reason is the estimated £10bn annual subvention from London to Belfast. Dublin cannot match this. Unification would in all probability mean slashing public sector jobs and services in the north and hiking taxes in the south, incentives for voters on both sides of the border to vote no.Analysts question the methodology of polls which rely on online panels and show a spike in support for unification. “Most people here take them with a grain of salt,” said Duncan Morrow, an Ulster University professor. Younger unionists may sigh at DUP fulminations against gay marriage and abortion rights, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they wish to join their socially liberal neighbour, he said.For all the Republic’s current progressive sheen, unionists are wary of a neighbour which kowtowed to Catholic bishops and marginalised its Protestant minority. “We were kept very quiet and almost disappeared,” said Robin Bury, author of Buried Lives: the Protestants of Southern Ireland. “There is still Anglophobia here, it’s still in the bloodstream. Unionist unease is justified,” he said.Ian Marshall, an anti-Brexit northern unionist and farmer, has good things to say about the Republic. The Irish government and Sinn Fein supported his election to the Seanad, Dublin’s upper chamber. Yet Marshall warns unification could create a “bloodbath” if loyalists feel alienated or pressured: “We could potentially turn the tap on again, and that fills me with horror.”Edward Burke, a terrorism expert at Nottingham University, echoed that concern, saying loyalist paramilitaries focused on criminal enterprises could revert to “Pavlovian instincts” of sectarian killing.“Tiocfaidh ár lá,” goes the republican slogan. Our day will come. An expression of longing masquerading as prophecy. Maybe it will come. But Ireland’s dreamers will need to be patient. And careful what they wish for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5afd1188f6378ca145f880559f1b502970afe17f/0_0_3337_2002/master/3337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d0f4743b29df74849654f9575dc9e7f","title":"typhoon mangkhut in pictures","story":"The strongest tropical storm of the year lashes the Philippines and now heads towards China’s southern coast"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mahmoud Abbas takes up invite extended when he met Simon Coveney in Ramallah in JanuaryOptometrists\u0026rsquo association calls for more treatment in community rather than hospitalsIncident in Warrenpoint condemned as \u0026lsquovile\u0026rsquo and blamed on Cliftonville supportersLondon native became unlikely champion of set dancing of Sliabh Luachra and Muscrai on Cork-Kerry borderMission will inquire into how Greenland and Antarctica ice adds to rising sea levelsContributions critical to advancing Paris Agreement, Higgins tells EU contest in RDSOriginal Rising document had been restored and conserved to museum standard in 2005PSNI received report of gun being fire at 1.30am on Saturday in New Lodge Road areaFirst World War memorial restored in project supported by Government in RepublicMan held after garda\u0026iacute uncover plants while responding to a fire at Silks in MalahideAnthony and Anne-Louise McGrath accused of lying about burglary to get funds to ease debtsDeadly disease threatens pig farmers across Europe after boars found dead in BelgiumPresident of IMO says right \u0026lsquolevel of diplomacy was not shown in all of the cases\u0026rsquoClub Rossie hopes to raise \u0026euro1.5 million from the raffle of a \u0026euro425,000 house in AshtownLocals react to cancellation of plans to build apartments flanking St Anne\u0026rsquos ParkSome the world\u0026rsquos brightest young minds descend on Dublin to showcase their projectsDriver uninjured in incident that happened on M18 near Ardrahan on Friday nightDuring 2016 and 2017 the number of staff leaving social care work outnumbered those startingDay-to-day HSE spending and insurance firm practices main culprits behind overspend"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3630827.1537079605!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in set to unveil presidential election candidate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin is expected to announce Liadh Ní Riada as its presidential election candidate.

She said there was a movement across the national church with events organised to emphasise the feminine nature of God.No academic theologian in the UK would objectively say that God is male, and yet that is the common parlance in a lot of the church and definitely the message that is coming across in lots of the media communications that we\u0027re sending out there, she said.Theologian and member of the Archbishops\u0027 Council the Revd Dr Ian Paul said that he believed the figures stemmed partly from a culture where sex identity is ever present.I think it makes it increasingly hard for young people to think of personal being without thinking of sex identity—and so if God is the ultimate ‘person’ then God must be sexed - i.e. male or female, he said.This view contradicts orthodox Christian teaching—but many young people don’t have enough contact with the church for actual Christian teaching to counter the thinking they pick up from culture.Church of EnglandChequers deal could be altered after Brexit by future Prime Minister, Michael Gove claimsTyphoon Mangkhut lashes Hong Kong after killing 49 in the  Philippines Ghostly outline of lost architectural masterpiece uncovered by aerial archaeologistsAmazon courier pays Liz Hurley\u0026#39s vet bill after driver \u0026#39runs over her dog\u0026#39How The  reported on the Spitfire through the agesComment: There is a Christian case to be made for capitalism.

The vicar was supreme.These days, the vicar will probably be overseeing, in a rural diocese, six or seven of those patches, and he or she will be working with a whole range of different colleagues, retired priests, part-time priests, lay ministers, lay officers of the church.And what the vicar needs is a capacity to supervise those people and to get the very best out of them, and to nurture and oversee a cohesive team. That is quite a shift in culture, he said.Clergy need to be people who above all else, can be open with God, open with one another, not defended, not prima donna-ish, but willing to collaborate in the building of the kingdom.The new Dean of the 800-year-old Salisbury cathedralSenior church figures have previously said that they are considering implementing psychometric testing as a national policy, in order to pick out clergy who have desirable values such as collaboration and teamwork.The tests have also been linked to a desire to weed out potential paedophiles amid concerns that potential child abusers could be slipping through the net.Thorough background checks already prevent convicted abusers from joining the clergy but the tests are being considered to strengthen the current process.Church of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyChequers deal could be altered after Brexit by future Prime Minister, Michael Gove claimsTyphoon Mangkhut lashes Hong Kong after killing 49 in the  Philippines Ghostly outline of lost architectural masterpiece uncovered by aerial archaeologistsAmazon courier pays Liz Hurley\u0026#39s vet bill after driver \u0026#39runs over her dog\u0026#39How The  reported on the Spitfire through the agesComment: There is a Christian case to be made for capitalism.

But the oldest test-tube baby - Louise Brown - is only 40 years old, so the long term impact of fertility treatment is still unknown. Prof Nargund and Mrs McDonagh are also lobbying  to link the HFEA registry with hospital, cancer and death registers, to enable accurate recording and publication of the links between IVF treatment and incidences of cancer and early deaths.And they are concerned that incidences of deadly Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome which are currently underreported by clinics who are anxious not to deter women from treatment.They warned of a ‘toxic combination’ of extremely vulnerable and desperate women and a commercial industry that is not being monitored.Mrs McDonagh said: “It is high time that we protected the welfare of women undergoing IVF. “It is now a multi-million pound industry with over 67,000 cycles carried out in the UK each year but it has grown far faster than the law associated with it.“Like all of the other issues I have campaigned on throughout my time as an MP, my involvement in this issue stemmed from my constituents.“The lack of concern about the welfare of women during IVF treatment is a scandal that cannot continue to exist.”Other countries, including the Netherlands, Australia, Scandinavia, Canada and the USA, have all combined their databases.The second reading of the amendment to the HFEA will be heard in Parliament on October 26.Please review our commenting policyChequers deal could be altered after Brexit by future Prime Minister, Michael Gove claimsTyphoon Mangkhut lashes Hong Kong after killing 49 in the  Philippines Ghostly outline of lost architectural masterpiece uncovered by aerial archaeologistsAmazon courier pays Liz Hurley\u0026#39s vet bill after driver \u0026#39runs over her dog\u0026#39How The  reported on the Spitfire through the agesComment: There is a Christian case to be made for capitalism.

IndependentAir pollution from traffic is believed to cost the NHS and society nearly £6bn every year in the UKEvidence that air pollution passes from pregnant women\u0027s lungs to the placenta has been found for the first time, according to a new UK study.Researchers detected what they believe are tiny particles of carbon, typically created by burning fossil fuels, after five non-smoking mothers living in London underwent planned Caesarean section births.\u0026nbspThe study adds to existing evidence on the dangers of pollution for unborn babies and suggests that when pregnant women breathe polluted air, sooty particles are able to reach the placenta via the bloodstream.Air pollution now \u0027biggest environmental risk in Europe\u0027Air pollution \u0027causing major reduction

links between pregnant mothers\u0027 exposure to air pollution and premature birth, low birth weight, infant mortality and childhood respiratory problems.Dr Lisa Miyashita, who worked on the study at Queen Mary University of London, said: Until now, there has been very little evidence that inhaled particles get into the blood from the lung.We\u0027ve known for a while that air pollution affects foetal development and can continue to affect babies after birth and throughout their lives.We were interested to see if these effects could be due to pollution particles moving from the mother\u0027s lungs to the placenta.The study was presented by Dr Miyashita, a post doctoral researcher, and Dr Norrice Liu, a paediatrician and clinical research fellow, at the European Respiratory Society International Congress on Sunday.All five of the women gave birth to a health baby at the Royal London Hospital after an uncomplicated pregnancy and gave permission for their placentas to be studied after delivery.The researchers studied cells called placental macrophages, which are part of the body\u0027s immune system and work by engulfing harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles, and help to protect the foetus.A high-powered microscope was used to look for small black areas that researchers believe were carbon particles.Out of a total of 3,500 placental macrophage cells, 60\u0026nbspcontained 72 small black areas between them.On average, each placenta contained around five square micrometres of this black substance.Tiny carbon particles were also found on a more detailed study of two placentas using an electron microscope.We were not sure if we were going to find any particles and if we did find them, we were only expecting to find a small number of placental macrophages that contain these sooty particles, said Dr Liu.This is because most of them should be engulfed by macrophages within the airways, particularly the bigger particles, and only a minority of small sized particles would move into the circulation.Our results provide the first evidence that inhaled pollution particles can move from the lungs into the circulation and then to the placenta.We do not know whether the particles we found could also move across into the foetus, but our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible.We also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby\u0027s body to have an adverse effect, because if they have an effect on the placenta, this will have a direct impact on the foetus.The study has led to calls for stricter clean air policies to reduce the impact of pollution on health.The worst countries in the world for air pollution deaths610 Bosnia and Herzegovina610 Bosnia and HerzegovinaPrevious research shows that pregnant

Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study.This new research suggests a possible mechanism of how babies are affected by pollution while being theoretically protected in the womb.This should raise awareness amongst clinicians and the public regarding the harmful effects of air pollution in pregnant women.We need stricter policies for cleaner air to reduce the impact of pollution on

museum brexit","story":"Created with Sketch.The Parthenon Sculptures have been the subject of debate for more than 200 years. With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”Amal\u0026nbspClooney\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspGeoffrey Robertson over the Elgin Marbles (Getty)The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”AFPGetty)Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

This means a public vote on any deal or a vote on a no deal, alongside the option of staying in the EU,” Mr Khan wrote in an article for The Observer.\u0026nbspThe Independent has already launched its own campaign for a fresh vote on the final deal, with over 800,000 iniduals signing a petition for a Final Say.Mr Khan, who has previously flirted with the prospect of a second vote, added that another public vote was “never inevitable” or “something I ever thought I’d have to call for”.\u0026nbsp“But the government’s abject failure – and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a ‘no-deal’ Brexit – means that giving people a fresh say is now the right – and only – approach left for our country,” he said.\u0026nbspHis remarks will likely mount pressure on Jeremy Corbyn, ahead of Labour’s annual conference next week, with over 100 anti-Brexit motions submitted, including calls for a fresh vote on the final deal.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn himself has repeatedly failed to rule out the prospect of a second vote, but has consistently said it is not party policy and Labour is not advocating the issue.\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchOne of this frontbenchers, Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has also suggested that another vote on EU membership could result in civil disobedience and social disruption.\u0026nbspThe intervention from Mr Khan also coincided with an article from Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who said that Labour would vote down any attempts to force the country into a “blind Brexit”.\u0026nbspHe said Theresa May must reach his party’s key Brexit tests for a deal with the EU, including delivering the “exact same benefits” as the UK currently has as a member of the single market and customs union, to secure Labour’s backing for her deal.\u0026nbspIn a letter to the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, Sir Keir added: “But, let me be equally clear: a vague political declaration would not meet those tests. Labour will not – and cannot – vote for a blind Brexit.”\u0026nbspLast week, it emerged that Mr Khan will be Labour’s candidate in the 2020 mayoral race after securing enough support from within the party\u0026nbspIn an article for The Independent, he said winning the contest will “not be easy”, adding: “We’re not only running against the Conservative Party – and we all remember how nasty the campaign was last time – but also against the former Conservative chancellor George Osborne, who is now editor of the Evening Standard.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/15/13/cable-conference-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3905566  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 15 September 2018  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/15/13/cable-conference-1.jpg","title":"gullivers world children trapped rollercoaster theme park","story":"Created with Sketch.Witnesses say 21 people stuck on ride for more than half an hourClick to followThe IndependentChildren trapped 50ft in air on rollercoaster after \u0027wheel falls off\u0027Some 21 people\u0026nbsphave been rescued after they were trapped on a rollercoaster at Gulliver\u0027s World in Warrington for 35 minutes when the ride malfunctioned.Emergency services were called to the theme park in Warrington, Cheshire,\u0026nbspshortly after 12.50pm on Saturday\u0026nbspand fire crews used ladders and scaffolding to free the group of mainly children and parents\u0026nbspstuck around 50 ft (15m) in the air.Footage posted on social media showed\u0026nbspthe ride suspended on the track after a wheel apparently fell off.Rollercoasters can cure kidney stones, scientists learnWorld’s fastest and highest ever e rollercoaster opening in CanadaTwo people fall 34ft from derailed rollercoaster in FloridaWitnesses at the park said many of the children were crying as they dangled mid-air.A Cheshire Fire \u0026amp Rescue Service spokeswoman said no-one was injured in the incident at the park, which is\u0026nbspmarketed at\u0026nbspchildren between the ages of two and 13.Detective Chief Superintendent Nigel Wenham, from Cheshire police, tweeted: @cheshirepolice have responded to incident at #GulliversWorld together with @CheshireFire North West Ambulance Service.

A majority of 52 per cent – an increase of nine points – said they would now think of giving their vote to a new group, and just 25 per cent said they would not.People were also asked if felt well represented by the current political parties, with 40 per cent saying in April that they felt very or fairly well represented, while 41 per cent said they were not very well or not represented.Raab picks row with John Lewis to ert attention from Brexit messEurostar \u0027will not run\u0027 if there is a no-deal BrexitTories backing far-right Orban to boost Brexit, says Muslim councilGovernment releases latest tranche of no-deal papersConservatives accused of seeking Brexit favours after backing OrbanBrexiteers call for end to talk of leadership challenge amid splits But by September a significant shift had occurred, with just 35 per cent saying the felt represented and 48 per cent – almost half – saying they felt isolated from the parties currently campaigning for votes.It comes after months in which Labour has been consumed by a discrimination crisis, with Jeremy Corbyn being forced to apologise after the party sought to alter part of the internationally recognised definition of antisemitism.Frank Field MP resigned the party whip after 39 years amid the row, citing allegations of bullying among members, while just last week ex-prime minister Tony Blair said: “This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don’t know.”Other MPs are also said to be considering resigning the whip, believing that the left is now so firmly in control of Labour that its dominance cannot be challenged.antisemitism, claims rabbi Jonathan SacksAsked if people would support a Labour split, 33 per cent said they would to some extent, 30 per cent said they did not feel strongly either way, 20 per cent said they did not know and just 18 per cent said they opposed it.For those who voted for Mr Corbyn’s party at the 2017 general election, 32 per cent backed a split and 33 per cent opposed it, with 24 per cent not feeling strongly either way and 12 per cent not knowing.Asked whether people would consider voting for an ‘independent Labour’ MP, who disagreed with Mr Corbyn on key issues, 35 per cent said they would, and 42 per cent said they would not and 23 per cent saying they did not know.At his party’s conference Mr Cable will flesh out a call for\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat\u0026nbspsupporters to be able to vote in the party’s leadership contests for free as part of a plan to turn it into a “movement for moderates”.The Lib Dem leader wants his party to adopt a “registered supporter” system that would allow non-members to help decide who takes over from him.In a sign that Brexit isions have left the Tories creaking at the seams, a handful of MPs including former ministers Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry, and Heidi Allen have said they will quit if ex-foreign secretary Mr Johnson becomes leader.Source note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,533 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspSeptember.

It is brave and it is self-aware to realise that more of the same in contemporary British politics isn’t going to cut it.“The bit I don’t like is that it is called this ‘movement for moderation’. Part of the problem is that the centre feels too insipid, too safe, too boring, too politics as usual, when in fact centrist thought, and small ‘l’ liberalism, can give rise to radical ideas that disrupt elites, disrupt closed shops, ideas that can really change things. That is the market in which the Lib Dems should be operating.”Another former Lib Dem staffer thinks it is not only the as yet unlaunched supporters association that will soon be needing a new name. It will be the whole party itself:“All this stuff, having registered supporters, changing the rules so a non-MP can be leader, they’re setting it up so that the party can be negotiated away into a new party. You don’t change the rules so that a non-MP can be leader unless you’re thinking about closing the party down.”Becoming the home for the army of radical centrists that must, surely, be out there somewhere, is one thing, but there are more pressing problems that\u0026nbsppeople inside the party have come to think might not be solvable.“There has been polling done to work out whether the party is toxic, and the results suggest it is,” said a former adviser. “The polling company, Populus, one of the seven groups they break the electorate down into is ‘left-wing intellectuals’.“They used to be our core vote. ‘Left-wing intellectuals’ voted for Charles Kennedy when they didn’t like the centrist Labour Party. They were the main swell of support. Those people are gone. When we polled it in February 2017 we were at 10 per cent with them.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union “It means we don’t really know what we are any more. Are we like the German FDP? Sensible, reliable\u0026nbspand an adjunct to government?“Or are we a Charles Kennedy style opposition party that opposes everything?“Kennedy constantly attacked Labour from the left, on civil liberties, on Iraq, on detention without charge. That stuff chimed with the voters we then lost in 2015, and they haven’t come back. They are now enamoured with Corbyn.“That was our base\u0026nbspand the polling shows we have become toxic with them. The party’s soul is with Charles Kennedy, but the future of the party is as an FDP.”The idea of setting up a registered supporters association, which is what ‘Momentum for moderates’ would be, is something that the party has considered doing for years. Tim Farron looked into it even Nick Clegg looked into it. Party insiders suggest Sir Vince now imagines it will be his legacy.But they still fall well short on quite what a ‘Momentum for moderates’ would do or stand for.\u0026nbsp“If you want to talk about the need of something new in the centre, it can’t be an existing brand,” said one former Lib Dem adviser, who worked for the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, during the years of coalition.“You have seen movements everywhere, whether it’s Macron, Momentum, or the alt-right in America, movements that work in conjunction with, alongside, in support of, and parallel to politicians have had success.“But what we need is to be more radical about the platform, the offer to voters.“Look at Labour under Ed Miliband. You’d see people from the left writing a 5,000-word essay in the New Statesman\u0026nbspon\u0026nbsp‘why Labour must have something to say on immigration’. And everyone agreed, but then they didn’t have anything to say.\u0026nbsp“The problem you might have is that everybody will say, ‘the centre needs to be more radical’, everyone will agree, but then you won’t have any radical ideas or policies.“People need to work out what the big spending measures the party would take are, what new environmental policies.“It might seem very Lib Demmy, but people actually do moan about how parties don’t represent them, about how the voting system is unfair and all that, so that is an area where we could offer change.“There are lots of people in Westminster, in and around politics who, if not sympathetic to the Lib Dems themselves are sympathetic to Lib Dem ideas. There’s environmental charities, people who are interested in the reform of broken systems like tax, or the electoral system.“And it just has got to feel a bit younger, a bit edgier. That is where Momentum has had success. Momentum is viewed as being only young people, but it really isn’t. It’s full of all sorts of people, some of whom have been around for decades, but the way they put themselves across makes people think it’s young and edgy.”Next weekend at Labour’s conference in Liverpool, you can be certain that hundreds if not thousands of the nation’s youth will assemble for an eve of conference rally, fully energised, mobilised and committed to the Corbyn project.But Liberal Democrats do not feel their chance has passed.How the Lib Dems will overhaul the broken immigration systemThe time to form a new centrist party is nowLet non-members vote in Lib Dem leadership contests, Cable saysLib Dem leader Vince Cable denies he is planning to quit partyFormer Lib Dem HQ now palatial £36m Westminster mansion with 10m pool“Not everyone under 25 in Britain is a socialist, or attracted to pretty hard left views,” said one former staffer. “But they do want some kind of significant change, and most of them want no Brexit so there is a market there.Privately, Lib Dems hope that ‘Momentum for moderates’ might attract 100,000 members. But if the party decides it wants to survive the party will need to change too.“They’ve got to overhaul the party’s processes,” said one ex staffer. “Things like the leader not being able to sack anyone. And the leader can’t set policy, which means they can’t announce policy.“We will see how we get on in the Sunday papers. But if you’re not in power and you can’t announce policy then what have you got to offer the media? They’ll just go to Labour instead.\u0026nbsp“Who will the interviews be with on Sunday, Vince or Keir Starmer? If it’s not Vince then we’re not in the conversation any more.”The Lib Dem fightback has been promised at every party conference since 2015 and, over the coming days, don’t expect 2018 to be any exception. But the starting point gets further away, and the questions more challenging. It will need plenty of momentum, and there is no time for moderation.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/12/ethiopia-eritrea-0.jpg","title":"ethiopia eritrea border leaders abiy ahmed isaias afwerki reconciliation peace","story":"Created with Sketch.Former bitter rivals make\u0026nbspstunning reconciliation to\u0026nbspimprove transport links between two countriesClick to followThe IndependentEritrea\u0027s president and Ethiopia\u0027s prime minister arrive for an inauguration ceremony marking the reopening of the Eritrean embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in JulyCelebrating their dramatic diplomatic thaw, the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea on Tuesday officially opened the border where a bloody war and ensuing tensions had ided them for decades.\u0026nbspEthiopia\u0027s reformist new prime minister,\u0026nbspAbiy Ahmed, and long-time Eritrean\u0026nbsppresident,\u0026nbspIsaias Afwerki, visited the Bure Front along with members of their militaries to mark the Ethiopian new year, Mr Abiy\u0027s chief of staff Fitsum Arega said in a Twitter post.\u0026nbspThe two then opened the border post for road transport connectivity and would shortly do the same at the Serha-Zalambesa crossing, Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Meskel said on Twitter.\u0026nbspPhotos posted by both officials showed Mr Abiy in camouflage and sunglasses walking alongside Mr Isaias in olive drab, while civilians lined a road with the countries\u0027 flags in hand.\u0026nbspThe former bitter rivals have made a stunning reconciliation since Mr Abiy, weeks after taking office in April, announced that Ethiopia would fully embrace a peace deal that ended a 1998-2000 border war that killed tens of thousands.At the time, he announced that the countries would celebrate the Ethiopian new year together: We want our brothers and sisters to come here and visit us as soon as possible.\u0026nbspEmbassies have reopened, telephone lines have been restored and commercial flights between the capitals have resumed as some long-separated families have held tearful reunions.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

I mean where\u0026rsquos instruction going to come from?Is it like \u0026lsquowell, we\u0026rsquoll decide where your border is and how we police it,\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash that will come from Brussels or Strasbourg, and not from the nation-state.Mr Bannerman did, however, appear to approve of the Commissioner\u0027s stance on the future relationship the bloc will have with the United Kingdom after Brexit.He praised the appeal for a creative solution to the Northern Irish border issue currently deadlocking the negotiations while proposing to strike a super Canada-type deal to maintain post-Brexit frictionless trade.He added: There\u0026rsquos certainly a lot of positive aspects as well as negatives ones - the positive ones for me were he wants a free trade area, as he calls it, with the UK.Brexit news: Juncker called for more cooperation as he said UK will become a honorary partner (Image: )                MP unveils solution to Brexit border deadlock EU \u0027REFUSES to discuss\u0027                Arch-Remainer Lord Adonis BOOED after suggesting to \u0027SCRAP BREXIT\u0027 That\u0026rsquos what I want, a super Canada type deal, plus plus plus, and he was hinting at that. He attacked the Chequer\u0026rsquos plan, he said you can\u0026rsquot have parts of a single market, I think that\u0026rsquos a real no-no for Chequer\u0026rsquos.He concluded: The other thing that\u0026rsquos very important, he said he\u0026rsquos looking for a creative solution, in his words, on Northern Ireland, and it\u0026rsquos a northern Ireland border issue that\u0026rsquos holding up a free trade agreement like Canada plus.We can get a breakthrough and that means a deal, so I think we are moving towards a positive position on that side.Speaking about three principles the EU will work towards over the UK\u0027s exit, Mr Juncker said that the masterful Michel Barnier was working with unanimous support from the 27 member states.Speaking about Northern Ireland, he went on: This parliament and all member states we show loyalty with Ireland on the Irish border. We want to find a creative solution to prevent a hard border and we will defend all the elements of the Good Friday Agreement. It\u0026rsquos Brexit making the border more visible, not EU.After 29 March 2019, the UK will never be an honorary third country. It will always be a very close partner in political, security terms.I welcome PM May\u0026rsquos proposal for ambitious partnership. We agree with Chequers a starting point should be a free trade area between UK and EU.We owe it to citizens and businesses to ensure the exit is orderly. It won\u0026rsquot be the Commission that stands in the way of this.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion orce bill  we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that  the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The ­family’s beloved pet dog was also killed by deranged Michael Stone.Josie herself was left with such severe head injuries that medics at she scene thought she was dead before finding a faint pulse.This little girl was a fighter.It must have been horrendous for both of them.Josie couldn’t speak for a year after the attack, had to have an operation to put a titanium plate in her head and her recovery was slow. It was all about small ­victories, and it was down to the tenacity of a little girl who just wanted to live a normal le.Now she is flourishing.Josie has become a successful artist, is engaged to her soul mate Iwan Jones and recently bought the family home in Wales where she spent her early childhood before they all moved to Kent where the attack happened.The house is full of happy memories and Josie dwells on events like her mum bringing home Rosie the pony when she was just five years old and teaching her to ride.Rosie is now a grand old lady of 27 and one of the most ­important things in Josie’s le.The feisty little pony is a link to her mum and little sister and played a massive part in her recovery. Learning how to ride again gave her confidence and a sense of freedom.Josie graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2009 and built up her own art business, first by selling handmade cards at fairs and now producing beautul ­textile landscapes.I’ve met Josie several times over the years, most memorably shortly after the accident when she was still coming to terms with the double tragedy of the death of both her mum and sister.She was shy and wary but gradually I gained her confidence and we spent a lovely afternoon together with her dad Shaun and Rosie the pony.I caught up with her again this week, and I’m always struck by her positivity and her refusal to be thought of as a victim.She very much lives in the moment and always tries to seize the day and be positive.Josie is a walking testament to the power of the human spirit and her mum would be very proud of her beautul, talented, happy daughter.LOTS of speculation already over who will be heading Down Under for I’m A Celebrity in November.Names being bandied around include EastEnder Danny Dyer, Corrie’s Michael Le Vell and former Strictly pro Brendan Cole.GMB’s Kate Garraway is keeping mum about rumours but she would be a hoot, although the person I’d really like to see there is my pal and TV colleague Dr Hilary Jones, who we’ve mocked up in the jungle, pictured.A team player and an action man, he also has a filthy sense of humour, doesn’t suffer fools gladly and would dispense medicine and advice when the insects start to bite and tummies get upset after being fed a diet of ostrich bum.And at the risk of objectying the good doctor, I would pay good money to see him in his skimpies having a shower at the famous waterfall.The ambitious project was first discussed in 2004, when I was rector of Dundee University. It’s wonderful to see it spring to le.Inevitably, costs spiralled. But hopefully the increase in tourism, business and the jobs created will more than offset the £80million price tag.As a proud adopted Dundonian, I want the V\u0026ampA to be a museum for everyone. I hope schoolchildren will enjoy the exhibits, friends will meet there for coffee and everyone in Dundee will think of it as their own.It’s here and I can’t wait to celebrate.IT’S a bit icky – and frankly unbelievable – that Corrie has Jim McDonald pretending his current girlfriend is his dead daughter in order to wreak revenge on his clan.More Game Of Thrones than a game of dominoes down the Rovers... and I can’t take it seriously., so I am. I’ve missed him bellowing “ELIZABETH!” and talking about being in the big house, so I have.I just wish they hadn’t oversensationalised his  because the character is big enough not to need such an OTT comeback.It did get me thinking as to who else I would like to see back in Soapland.And one fab character sprang to mind. I’m sure you recall Emmerdale’s Paul Lambert, who made a huge impact during his five years in the Dales.Paul was played by the ridiculously handsome Mathew Bose, who must have a painting in the attic because he hasn’t aged a day since leaving school.Surely his  is long overdue. His family are still in Emmerdale, including dad Rodney Blackstock, auntie Diane Sugden and his half-sisters. There are lots of layers to Paul, too.His alter-ego is drag queen Thelma Louise, while he and his boyfriend Jonny were the first characters in a primetime drama to have a civil partnership, back in 2008.Surely such an interesting character should be welcomed back to Emmerdale with open arms.We will know more tomorrow night, but I’m spending far more time than is good for me speculating about how it’s all going to be resolved.IT’S been a long time since I considered Jacob Rees-Mogg an amusing anachronism, a bit like a pocket watch.Behind this softly spoken throwback to the Victorian age is a flinty hard-liner who would deny a raped woman the right to an abortion.He’s hell-bent on a rock-hard Brexit, and he doth protest too much about not wanting to be Prime Minister for it to ring true. So it’s fair to say I’m not a fan.But I was appalled by the rude, ignorant mob of “class warriors” who heckled his kids and their elderly nanny outside the family home this week.It was cruel, savage and out of order. Rees-Mogg has chosen to be a politician and is used to being barracked.His children, however, are NOT public figures. They are little kids, who looked scared by the thuggish behaviour of the idiots, who did their cause no good at all.They were there to protest about the minimum wage, and one of them shouted at the children that their nanny, Veronica Crook, wasn’t paid very much to “wipe their bottoms”.Veronica, who has been with the family for half a century, was not best pleased by this, and in a brisk, no-nonsense way defended her boss and ushered her charges indoors. You got the feeling she would dearly have loved to give the protesters a very hard stare and sit them on the naughty step.Politicians from all sides expressed their disgust but those responsible don’t think they have done anything wrong.The minimum wage is well worth fighting for, but not like this.The demonstrators managed to humanise Rees-Mogg, and gained him bucketloads of sympathy.

May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And not content with taxing fizzy drinks, he targets the  CUPS.One sneaky grab after another, from people already struggling. What part of “just about managing” doesn’t he grasp?Mr Hammond is a glum, grey, blinkered bean-counter with no vision, political nous or clue how hard le is for the low-paid. His instincts, not to lower taxes from a 30-year high but to raise them, have no place in a Tory Treasury.Can the upcoming Budget reprieve him? We doubt it.SOME rail services are a disgrace, a ­grotesque betrayal of paying customers.So we welcome the review into their future. If it nails the myth that renationalisation is the answer, all the better.A frustrated public seems keen to take trains back into state hands. Older people have only dim memories of British Rail’s endless strikes, late trains, filthy carriages and lousy food. Younger generations weren’t born to experience it.Some private firms do run a great service. Others give the  system a bad name.Fares are too high and absurdly complex. Franchises are regional monopolies with no need to compete — all of them vulnerable to union blackmail.It is high time Transport Secretary Chris Grayling got to grips with it.THE Lib Dems won’t fool anyone with the “rebranding” Vince Cable fancies.The “New Liberal Democrats” would not be new, liberal or democratic.Reheated Blair ideas aren’t new.A party committed to state regulation of the Press and maintaining the EU’s protectionist trade policies isn’t liberal.And champions of democracy don’t fixate on overthrowing the biggest ­ballot box ­mandate in our history.Back to the blank slate, Vince.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There should’ve been a vet on the scene straight away.“There should have been intervention prior to this horrendous situation and, at the very least, immediate action should have been taken after the birth to establish why it occurred.”Humane Society International’s Wendy Higgins added: “This is a devastating, rare insight into the shockingly poor existence of animals at this zoo.[They] are confined to heartbreakingly small enclosures, often almost entirely barren, in which all they can do is pace or swim the same circular route.The barren zoo was opened in 1959 by Kim Il-sung, who went on to visit it 20 times as Supreme Leader.Son Kim Jong-Il made 31 visits, while current leader Kim Jong-Un has made six appearances."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000420437953.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady column alcohol vanity good health","story":"One day, butter is the enemy. The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Conservative MEPs opposed a motion in the European Parliament condemning Orban for attacking Muslim and Jewish minorities and suppressing free speech and press freedom. The Tories were the only governing party in Western Europe to vote in support of the Hungarian PM. Mr Orban has been accused of fostering anti-semitism with his “relentless campaign” against the Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros. One of the UK’s leading Jewish organisations, the Board of Deputies, said it was disappointed Conservative MEPs had voted in defence of Hungary’s far-right government. There were claims Tory MEPs voted against the motion to censure Hungary because Orban could be helpful to Britain in the Brexit negotiations. Orban himself arrived at the meeting of the European Parliament saying: “We would like to have a fair Brexit because we love the British and because we cooperated always well – and you deserve a good deal, a fair deal.” Asked  he was pleased to have the support of Mr Orban, Mr Gove told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr: “It’s not for me to rank a league table of EU leaders and say that one is my favourite and that one I have less time for, because I believe in cooperative diplomacy. Even generosity of spirit towards our EU partners.”  Host Andrew Marr listed a string of Orban’s most horric abuses, including describing migrants as “poison” and Muslims “invaders”, making it a criminal offence for lawyers to represent asylum seekers and targeting the judiciary and media in Hungary. Marr asked: “This is the man your party in the European Parliament has decided to support - why?” Gove argued it was not true to say his party’s MEPs had supported Orban. “No it’s not true, Andrew,” he insisted “And it’s critically important that we realise this. “There was a vote in the European Parliament, but there is a long standing principle of a number of MEPs from dferent countries and from dferent parties, not to believe that the European Parliament should interfere in, or censure, the internal democracy of a particular country. “You or I might have particular views about other countries, but the European Parliament and those within it, British MEPs and others, believe that that’s the wrong way of expressing criticism.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan piles pressure jeremy","story":"NewsBREXIT NEWS: Sadiq Khan piles pressure on Jeremy Corbyn by calling for new referendumLabour\u0027s London Mayor says the public must have the right to reject a Brexit deal  it would be bad for the countryShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter08:14, 16 SEP 2018Updated08:26, 16 SEP 2018News \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSadiq Khan piled pressure on Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May this morning, by calling for a new Brexit referendum.

And he was praised for saying zero-hours contracts were the “reincarnation of an ancient evil”.

But Perry Tatler miraculously survived the suicide attempt five months ago and has bravely spoken out from his hospital bed as he continues his recovery. He has apologised to the witnesses of the traumatic event and pledged to turn his le around.  The 29-year-old can vividly recall the moment when he kissed his two children, aged two and one, goodbye for what he believed was for the last time after taking them to the park, reports Devon Live .   Perry then made the journey to Torquay railway station on a busy Saturday afternoon on April 7. During the incident two air ambulances landed at nearby Torquay Rugby Club and train services through the station were suspended for more than two hours. Peter was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  after being shot twice while serving in Afghanistan. While he has no recollection of those who were around him, he says he can clearly remember being in a ‘zone’ where he had lost all hope of overcoming the problems he had been unable to share with anyone else.  Despite throwing himself in front of a train travelling through the platform, he has lived to tell the tale and is encouraging others to seek help  they are feeling suicidal. The dad-of-two remains in hospital five months on having sustained a broken back, shoulder and ribs, and a bleed on the brain. But he is walking again with the aid of crutches and a back brace, and it uncertain whether he will make a full recovery. Perry said: “When you get that low you feel like you’ve got no other choice. That’s how the demons make you feel. It sounds really bad but I don’t regret doing it as it’s made me appreciate le more.  “But I do want to say sorry to the people who were there on the platform at the time, and the train driver. I didn’t want to put any harm onto anyone else mentally. “I also want to say thank you to the emergency services who I have a new respect for, as I do all the nurses who have looked after me.” For five years Perry served in the Army in the infantry, and two months into a tour serving in Afghanistan in 2011 he was shot in both legs during a routine patrol. He was medically discharged from the Army two years later and had been diagnosed with PTSD which he had been receiving support for. However, after ing back to civilian le he believed he could deal with his issues without help. Perry said: “The injuries I suffered in Afghanistan were more mental than physical because luckily both bullets went straight through my legs rather than hitting my main arteries or bone. “I physically recovered from the injuries but about a year after the incident I didn’t want to go out or do anything. “When I was discharged from the Army I thought I could deal with it myself.”  In 2017 Perry moved to Torquay with his ex-partner and held down a security job at Exeter Prison while his mental health deteriorated. After Christmas 2017 things started getting worse. “I put a smile on my face and all my work colleagues thought I was happy but it was all false, he admitted. Being a man I just bottled it up. I felt so low and helpless to the point I didn’t think I could take it anymore. ”The breaking point came that weekend in April when he took his children to the park for what he believed would be the last time he would ever see them again. “I kissed them goodbye which was the hardest thing knowing what I was going to do,” he said.“I then remember everything such as walking down to the train station and walking to the end of the platform. “I don’t remember seeing anyone but I have been told there were lots of people who saw me jump in front of the train, including children which I feel really bad about.

Obsessed Anthony Mantova was so twisted he even wore a T-shirt with a picture of the face of his victim – Chloe Hopkins. After years of fear and misery Chloe, 26, suffers from post-traumatic stress. Now she is backing the Sunday People’s campaign for a national register for persistent stalkers. Mantova, 41, has been jailed three times for breaching \u0026shyrestraining orders. Chloe said: “Prison didn’t stop him. After being jailed twice he was walking around wearing a T-shirt with my face on, telling people I am a horrible bitch. I sobbed, sick to my core. “Wherever I turned he seemed to be there. I was gripped with fear. I felt so alone.”  Chloe’s hell began in 2010 after she won a beauty contest to become Miss Prestatyn – her home town in Denbighshire – and was asked to switch on the Christmas lights there. Her career as a singer was \u0026shytaking off and she signed a record deal with Universal. One evening she introduced herself to a man alone in a pub and wished him a Merry Christmas. It was the worst thing she could have done. Mantova sent her a Facebook request, followed by a message saying her tiara and sash “would look good on his \u0026shybedroom floor”. He turned up at her public engagements and rang her to “breathe heavily” on the phone. In early 2011 he flashed his chest to her in a pub revealing a \u0026shytattoo of her name.  She said: “It \u0026shyreally disturbed me. I told him it had to stop. He stormed off.” Multiple \u0026shysclerosis sufferer Mantova started a Facebook \u0026shypetition calling for Chloe to lose her title, \u0026shyaccusing her of \u0026shybeing \u0026shyprejudiced against disabled people. Chloe told her parents she was \u0026shybeing stalked. A \u0026shypolice \u0026shyharassment warning was served on Mantova but he carried on sending messages and loitering outside her home. In July 2012 Prestatyn \u0026shymagistrates found him guilty of harassment. He was jailed for 18 weeks and given an \u0026shyindefinite restraining order against Chloe. She began treatment for PTSD after suffering anxiety attacks and \u0026shydeveloping bulimia. By that November she had lost 3\u0026frac12 stone and had to put her music career on hold. Mantova breached his \u0026shyorder shortly after being released, by \u0026shyfollowing Chloe and \u0026shyharassing her online. He was jailed for another 28 days. She moved to London but Mantova persisted and she \u0026shyreported him for wearing the shirt and abusing her online. Chloe said: “It felt never ending.” "},{"url":null,"title":"defence chiefs spend 6m private","story":"NewsDefence chiefs spend £6m on private healthcare for serving troops – as veterans battle demons aloneForces personnel with conditions such as PTSD, depression and addiction are being sent to costly units due to the national shortage of mental health bedsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan WarburtonSean Rayment20:59, 15 SEP 2018NewsExperts say it highlights a disparity between treatment given to serving troops and former personnel who get little help \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDefence chiefs spent more than \u0026pound6million on private healthcare for serving troops – as veterans battled their demons alone.  Forces personnel with conditions such as PTSD, depression and addiction are being sent to costly units due to the  national shortage of mental health beds.  Experts say it highlights a disparity between treatment given to serving troops and former personnel who get little help. Col Richard Kemp, ex-commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said: “There should not be a disparity between the type of treatment that serving soldiers receive and retired soldiers are given.” Sunday People research found 2,630 troops have been given private, taxpayer-funded treatment since 2015. The Ministry of Defence bill was revealed under Freedom of Information laws. Our Save Our Soldiers campaign is demanding better support for trauma-stricken troops.

And this biscuit-loving feline is clearly no exception. The moggy was pictured as it walked into its local branch of Tesco on Thursday as it headed straight for its favourite snack. Once in the pet food aisle, the white cat with a black tail knocked-over a box of Go-Kat biscuits before taking a nap next to them.

Charles McCadden bought the upper-floor flat of a two-storey Victorian terrace on Burrows Road, Kensal Green, Brent, in 2016 using inheritance money. He purchased the flat on a leasehold basis and soon had the place redecorated, installing a new kitchen, bathroom, and central heating system. However, his property has been seized by the freeholder, Dr Afshan Malik - who lives downstairs - because he didn\u0027t get her permission before he started redecorating. Seeking her permission before carrying out improvement works were part of his lease.   Mr McCadden says he has been destitute and suicidal over the dispute, reports The Times .  Campaigners have said the case is one of most extreme they have seen and say it serves as a warning to leaseholders. The case has also sparked calls for a reform to a current law which allows freeholders to seize a property  there is a breach in the lease. Mr McCadden and Dr Malik\u0027s relationship broke down over a disagreement about maintenance costs and he took the case to a property tribunal. The court ruled last November: These are serious breaches and the next step will be for the applicant to apply to the county court to forfeit the lease.  MrMcCadden was ordered to pay \u0026pound216.62 in outstanding service charges and reimburse her the \u0026pound300 tribunal administration fee. He then refused to reverse the works or pay the fees to Dr Malik and she took him Willesden County Court who issued a forfeiture order and then a possession order, which transferred the lease to her name. Mr McCadden, who has a chronic medical condition, is now left with nothing. He claims he was not aware of the tribunal hearing because he was living in Scotland at the time, looking after his father who was seriously ill.  Further to this, he says he was unable to defend the forfeiture and possession orders after being let down by lawyers. He also said the works were minimal and disputed the service charges. Sebastian O’Kelly, of the charity Leasehold Knowledge Partnership , said: “Mr McCadden has been found to be an inconsiderate neighbour and a leaseholder with no understanding of his obligations. The sensible course would have been to reverse the works or settle up with Dr Malik for having carried them out wrongfully. “But the loss of a \u0026pound600,000 asset is out of proportion to the dispute . . . The key question is: what  it had been the other way around and the freeholder had been inconsiderate?  “This ruling will be hugely comforting for the commercial interests in residential leasehold. They know that their multibillion-pound speculations in ordinary people’s homes all have the nuclear option of forfeiture to enforce them.” Mr McCadden said: “The whole episode has made me feeling very anxious, stressed out and at times suicidal. I am living a nightmare. It does not feel real. I can’t believe what has happened.” Currently, about 40 per cent of new properties are sold as leasehold, meaning the homeowner owns the property but not the land it is built on. A lease is a contract and  a leaseholder breaches the terms, the landlord could take legal action against them. In order to gain possession of the property by forfeiting the lease it is necessary to obtain a court order. A freeholder must give the leaseholder valid notice of the breach under section 146 of the law. The leaseholder must agree that breach has occurred or it will be taken to the first-tier property tribunal or a court which will determine the amounts due. A section 146 cannot be served for debts under \u0026pound350 or less than three years. A leaseholder can apply to court to seek relief from forfeiture.  This means having the forfeiture set aside and the lease restored. The court can grant or refuse relief, which is more likely to be in favour of the leaseholder  they react swtly, pay any arrears, remedy any breaches of covenant and pay the landlord’s costs."},{"url":null,"title":"glamorous instagram influencer lifts lid","story":"NewsGlamorous Instagram influencer lts lid on world of free luxury trips and how she bagged FIVE wedding dressesRachel Ward, 27, from Cheshire, described how brands approach her hoping to encourage her to post pictures to her 250,000 followersShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMirror08:52, 16 SEP 2018Updated11:23, 16 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/weird-news/video/five-wedding-dresses-free-luxury-13254273,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA former model has described how she turned her love for posting pictures online into a lucrative career. Rachel Ward, 27, traded in her catwalk career and now earns thousands of pounds by sharing images on the social network. Sher is an influencer, who are used by brands to engage with their loyal audiences and persuade consumers to part with their cash. Rachel, from Cheshire, became an influencer - a growing and effective form of marketing - six years ago after becoming disillusioned with the modelling world, the Manchester Evening News reports. Rachel, is now enjoying a jet-setting lestyle on her own terms as a fashion, beauty and travel influencer. It involves flying to exotic and romantic locations - including Monaco, Cannes, Dubai and the Males - to create the perfect backdrop for her photoshoots, and working with major, famous brands including Dior and Estee Lauder.  Rachel told us just how much work goes on behind-the-scenes, and that it isn’t just about travelling the world, reclining in a sun-lounger and posting an obligatory tag. “An influencer is a blogger or public figure. I post pictures of my outfits after brands send me clothes and I pick the things I would wear,” the fashion graduate explained. “I’m a fashion blogger, photographer, stylist and editor. For my fashion degree I trained in Photoshop. “Half of my work is images and editing.  “I travel the world to create good images. You go away, take pictures on holiday and hope they’ll notice you presenting the location nicely and hopefully you get invited back.” She added: “The modelling world wasn’t for me. I have more control over the photos and the whole thing now.” Rachel, from Northwich, is married to hotelier Thomas Cottrell and she built her social media following on Twitter , at first, before advising fans to follow her on photo and video sharing platform Instagram . She now has more than 40,000 followers on Twitter, 255,000 on Instagram and more than 100,000 watch her style and makeup tutorials on the video sharing network Tik Tok. But her biggest following is on the online fashion trend portal 21 Buttons ,where influencers can share their outfits and latest looks.  Rachel hit the headlines when she showcased five dferent wedding gowns across two wedding days when she tied the knot with Thomas, 26. She wore two dresses for their wedding day in the Males last year, changing out of the first one because it felt tight after the wedding breakfast. She wore another three for a ceremony in June attended by family and friends, at Irton Hall in the Lake District, after they discovered their overseas ceremony meant they weren’t legally wed in the UK. One of the gowns, by designer Nicole Prose, was bought for her by her parents and ordered from Milan after she spotted her dream look at Eternity Bridal in Warrington.

Jobless Gavin Innes and 46-year-old Gillian each had a pot of tea as they chatted, laughed and compared pictures of their respective kids. The 45-year-old picked up the \u0026pound3.78 tab and insists he had no idea she was super rich... even though she picked him up at his two-bed council house in a Porsche. Gavin claims Gillian even pretended to be an office worker and only revealed her wealth on a second date weeks later, again over a cuppa. They had agreed to meet up after exchanging flirty chat via Facebook.  After hitting it off Gavin says they even talked about marriage just nine weeks into their six-month romance. But despite some good times it all ended in tears. And Gavin claims Gillian is lonely and that her Euromillions jackpot win has not bought her happiness. He says she seemed happier spending time scoffing cake at his humble home rather than going back to her mansion. Gavin also claims mum-of-two Gillian – who wed ex-prisoner Brian Deans, 37, last month – is just desperate to be loved. He says: “She was so lonely. You never meet a happy millionaire.  “She brought up marriage after about nine weeks and asked how I’d propose to her. I said I wanted to live together first.” The unlikely couple were thrown together after both signing up to a l reunion group on social media for people who attended Harris Academy in Dundee. Incredibly, Gavin says he did not realise she was the local lass who scooped the \u0026pound148million Lotto jackpot with her first husband Adrian. Gillian’s face has been plastered over the papers and on TV ever since the Euromillions win in 2012. But as their relationship developed father-of-two Gavin says he witnessed Gillian splashing the cash. He goes on: “She was throwing money at everybody. “But she preferred to stay at my house. There were a few times I saw the real Gillian.  “Once we got up at 3am and sat eating chocolate cake, before going for a drive along the coast in our pyjamas. “More of that would have been cool, just taking off. I could have fallen in love with that Gillian. “Another time, we sat under a railway bridge taking pictures of fire spinners. “She couldn’t believe how much fun she had, yet no one knew who she was. That was the best date we had.” Gavin recalls their first date, too, at the Kingsway Farm carvery just off the A90 in Dundee.  And he addresses sceptics who wonder how he never knew about Gillian’s Lotto luck. He says: “I don’t have a telly so I don’t watch the news. “I didn’t recognise Gillian when we first met and I don’t remember her from being at school as she was in the year above. “She said she worked in an office and moaned about how her boss was a pain in the a**e. “But she came to pick me up for our first date in a Porsche – it was strange to see a car like that coming up my street, which is kind of rough. “I thought it would be tacky to ask why she had a Porsche. “I thought whatever she did, she must be good at it. I was just happy to be in a Porsche.  “But even after she told me, I still paid for things. I’m old fashioned, I guess. “She wasn’t my usual type, physically, but I was attracted to her because she was charismatic and funny. We didn’t talk about money. “We mainly talked about our kids. We had a cup of tea, which I paid for.” Gavin says he and Gillian had begun a private conversation on Facebook after she expressed interest in a charity he wanted to launch to aid male victims of domestic abuse. She used her real name but Gavin insists he still didn’t click that she was a lottery winner. He says: “I was lonely, too. I just wanted some female company.” Gavin tells how Gillian revealed her fortune over another cuppa three weeks after the first date. He says she whipped out her mobile phone to show him the famous shot of her and Adrian, 47, holding champagne flutes and their whopping \u0026pound148million cheque. Gavin says he thought the picture was a fake – because he had mocked up a photo where he was holding a winner’s cheque. He recalls: “She told me she had something to tell me and showed me the picture of her and Adrian. I asked  she’d Photoshopped it. “I’d Photoshopped a similar one of me ‘winning’ the lottery. “She kind of looked offended and said, ‘No, I won it’. “My first question was: ‘How do you trust anyone?’ She said: ‘You just have to be careful’. “I assumed that’s the reason why she didn’t tell me at first.” As the romance developed, Gavin says that Gillian tried to help him get off unemployment benefit. He explains: “She hated me being on benefits so she told me to come off them. “I was nervous because I’d relied on them for years. “I was offered two or three jobs, but she told me to turn them down.”  Gavin claims he tried to play peacemaker between Gillian and her estranged family – dad Ian McCulloch, 71, mum Brenda, 68, and brother Colin, 43. They were living in a caravan park when Gillian hit the jackpot. At the time Ian said of his daughter: “Money won’t change Gillian. She’s just a lovely girl, a gem.” But the family later claimed Gillian turned her back on them. In response, Gillian has said: “It’s upsetting and raw. The money was supposed to make everybody happy. “But it’s made them demanding and greedy. “They’ve been given money and houses and cars but still wanted more.” Gavin says he only found out his relationship with Gillian was over Gavin when a reporter came to his door.  He believes one of the reasons the romance turned sour was because he tried to get her to heal her family rt. Gavin says: “She never talked about her parents, she avoided any conversation about them. “I just didn’t get it, I offered to come with her to mediate – but she didn’t want any help.” Gavin has faced accusations of being a gold digger.

Mark Woollen was subjected to a horric ordeal during which Grant Embleton held an insulin pen to his neck after Mark asked him for \u0026pound15 he owed him.  The 45-year-old victim now says he is living in fear after his neighbour turned on him, Chronicle Live reports.   The 27-year-old thug, from Wallsend, Newcastle, was jailed for 14 months after pleading guilty to the frightening assault.  But Mark says he has been forced to move out the area he has called home all his le fearing Embleton will come after him once he is released. And today as he relived his ordeal to Chronicle Live, the victim told how he believed the attacker would carry out his threats.  He said: As he was making that threat he was trying to pull my zip down. I really thought he was going to do it. He was always up and down as far as moods were concerned, but I never once in my le suspected he would do that to me. Mark met Embleton through his dad who lived opposite him near North Shields. He took his neighbour’s son under his wing and helped him out whenever he needed anything, he said. We got on well, said Mark. He would come across from time to time  he wanted to borrow anything. Shortly before the attack Embleton confided in Mark that he had been going through a hard time. He said he was suffering from mental health problems and that his mobile phone had been stolen while he was on the . Taking pity on his friend, Mark offered to sell him his old phone for \u0026pound15.  I felt a bit sorry for him, Mark explained. However, after more than a week Embleton had still not paid up. On the night on the attack, in March, Embleton turned up drunk at Mark’s house and said his dad had thrown him out. As the two friends chatted, Mark mentioned the phone, and this caused Embleton to flip. I was perfectly calm, but he just lost it, said Mark. He was completely dferent to how I had ever seen him before. That’s when I started to get scared and that’s when he launched into the attack.  Embleton punched Mark in the face several times before grabbing a set of pliers that Mark used to make models. He said he would cut off my you know what, said Mark. But because I wouldn’t let him get my zip he started to cut my ear. I was absolutely terried. Embleton also held an insulin pen to Mark’s neck during the terrying ordeal. I was in a lot of pain, said Mark. My ear was pouring with blood. I kept saying ‘Grant, just calm yourself down’. But he was just having none of it. I just wanted to calm him down and get out of the situation. Embleton eventually left Mark’s home saying he was going to get the last  home and taking his victim’s phone with him. Terried Mark ran out the house. Not wanting to wake his neighbours Mark attempted to run to the nearest payphone, but he got stuck on a fence on the way. I ran out the back door and climbed over the fence and ran across the school field, he said. But as I tried to get over a second fence, that’s where I got myself stuck. Mark attempted to flag down passing motorists. Eventually a woman stopped and called the police for him. The following day Embleton ed to Mark’s home to say ‘sorry’.

He is also accused of launching a \u0027campaign of terror against Lori, 38, and her 11-year-old daughter Jocelyn, who is reportedly so close to Thomas she calls him \u0027Uncle\u0027.  According to the Mail on Sunday , Sandoval allegedly drove past Mr Markle\u0027s home, in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, last week yelling: I’m going to kill you, you fat f*****.   Sandoval – who was jailed for 30 months in the US for illegally entering the country before being deported in 2000 – denies the claims. Details of the alleged intimidation were revealed in an eight-page police report filed by Ms Davis last week, the newspaper reports. In it, she accused Sandoval of slashing Mr Markle\u0027s tyres. She also alleges he grabbed her by the throat and choked her. The report reads: He spat on my face… he goes to my uncle’s house and tells him that he is going to kill him because he is constantly hiding me and threatens and insults him.

Brandon Bromby was in hospital for six weeks after the accident on Christmas Eve - which happened in a split second.   The then three-year-old has been scarred for le with 24 percent of his body burned, Hull Live reports.  Brandon entered the bathroom and moments later fell into the bath fully clothed in the 2014 accident. His sister, then 12, managed to pull him out quickly but the damage had already been done.  Mum Sam, of east Hull, still gets emotional as she recounts what happened. “He fell in and I immediately took off his clothes,” she said. “Brandon didn’t scream at all because he was in shock. “When I took his clothes off it was just horrible. The skin was falling off his hand. “We called an ambulance and he was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary but, almost immediately, he was transferred to Pinderfields.” Sam remembers some parts of the accident vividly but says some of it is a blur. “I remember exactly when it happened,” she said, “but I was in complete shock. It was very scary and we were at Pinderfields before we knew it. “I didn’t realise hot water could do as much damage as any fire.”  It was a dficult juggling act for Sam and husband, Steve. “We have four other children who were all impacted,” Sam said. “We couldn’t spend time together as a family. “My oldest daughter was living with her boyfriend and took the other children in while we were in Pinderfields. They didn’t have much of a Christmas. “The hospital was fantastic and let me get a taxi about a week after it happened so I could spend some time at Christmas with my other children.” Brandon remained in hospital for six weeks but even when he was released there was still a long road of recovery ahead. “He had ious operations and needed skin grafts,” Sam said. “Even after he left hospital he needed cream putting on every day, wore pressure garments and had splinters on his hands. “It also affected both his feet so he couldn’t walk for a long time so he had to learn to do it again with lots of physiotherapy. “The skin will stretch as he gets older so Brandon is probably going to need another skin graft when he is older. “He will be scarred for le and the burns covered 24 per cent of his body.”  What helped Brandon and countless other children was Pinderfields Burns Club which was established to help children face the challenges of suffering a burn injury. The club, headed by Tracy Foster, ensures youngsters face treatment in an atmosphere of fun, support and rehabilitation resulting in an improvement in care and experience. It was developed in response to the needs of burn-injured children who lacked appropriate psychological support. “The burns club has been fantastic,” Sam said, “and Tracy has helped us so much. “Brandon is doing brilliantly now but when people ask him what happened he doesn’t know what to say and he gets self-conscious. “But he has been to places like Sherwood Forest and even Tenere with the burns club and it has helped him psychologically to be with other kids who have been through something similar. They even compare scars and injuries. “The club helps children rebuild their lives and those of their families. “Brandon is strong and a fighter and is not ashamed of his scars. “I am also relieved he is not scared of water and even takes baths.

The Sunday Mirror can reveal authorities are keeping a close hold on details of the other two suspects.

But the photo is a true picture of courage – as they became friends while waiting for lesaving lung transplants. All born with cystic fibrosis, George Compton, 28, Ashley Harris Moore, 36, Libby Clare, 22, Holly van Geffen, 26, Sharon Brennan, 37, Charlotte Davies, 24 and Josie Stewart, 25, have had their lives saved by the kindness of anonymous donors. Diagnosed with the genetic condition as youngsters, they \u0026shyhad a few years of good health before declining to the point where they needed new organs.  Holly, whose deterioration started aged 18 when a lung \u0026shycollapsed, said: “You try to battle on as best you can and not let your condition hold you back. “But there does come a point when you see all your peers growing up, becoming more\u0026shy \u0026shyindependent and doing all these adult things while you feel as  you’re regressing.” Although all had the support of family and friends, they found it was a great help to speak to somebody else who was weathering the \u0026shyemotional storm of waiting for a transplant. Over time, they found each other through a Facebook support page, eventually setting up a WhatsApp group called Transplant Girls. Josie said: “We built up such a special bond.” But, due to strict cross-infection rules, cystic fibrosis patients are normally told not to meet in person until after their operation. So for years their friendship existed only in the digital world, where they spoke every week. At least 10,400 people in the UK have the disease, which causes the lungs to become clogged with sticky mucus, making it dficult to breathe and leaving sufferers far more vulnerable to le-threatening infections.  One by one, the group began receiving \u0026shytransplants, with Charlotte having the first in October 2011, and Josie the last in July 2016. Those who had operations offered reassurance to those still waiting, and they all checked in with each other regularly – determined to keep their spirits up and their bond strong. Then, having all recovered from their transplants and adjusted to their new normal, the group were finally able to meet in person for the first time in July 2018, toasting their health – and friendship – together over a bottle of fizz in London’s Chinatown. George said: “We chose London as that’s the easiest place for everyone to get to. A couple of us have met one-on-one over the years but we’ve never all been together as a group before. “It was so amazing to see them all there in person and to laugh, drink and \u0026shycelebrate le together.”  Now the group are all supporting the Sunday People and Sunday Mirror’s Change the Law for Le campaign. They are calling on people not only to sign up as donors but also to share those wishes with their loved ones. Libby said: “I want to ask people,  your mum, dad, daughter, brother, friend or even you were ill, would you take a donor organ? “If the answer is yes then you need to think about giving one too.”  George Compton, 28 George was diagnosed at 18 months and spent most of her childhood in hospital. Even holding a conversation was a challenge as hospital administrator George, whose carpenter husband Lee, 32, has been her rock – would be too breathless to get words out. Then, at 21, her right lung collapsed and she was put on the transplant list. But, doing well on drug Kalydeco, she removed herself against advice.  In September 2014 her lungs began to give up again. Put on the transplant list, she got new lungs 11 months later. Her le changed instantly, as she was able to do all the little things that had once felt impossible, like blowing out birthday candles. The next year, she met her donor’s family after letters and they remain close. George, from Cobham, Surrey, said: “I’ve lived not able to breathe properly. After the op I could whistle and blow-up balloons – stupid little things that meant a lot to me.” Ashley Harris Moore, 36 Ashley was born before the heel prick test so was not diagnosed until she was two. The condition did not hold back active Ashley until, aged 14, a severe infection put her on intravenous antibiotics. She went to university but in 2015 declined dramatically. Desperate loved ones, including her computer scientist husband Alastair, 38, launched Ashley’s Next Breath, to encourage people to sign up as donors.  Ashley said: “The physical suffering was horrendous but I wouldn’t wish the emotional toll on anyone. Worrying what would happen to Emerson   I didn’t make it was torture. “Even now, I’ll catch him getting ready for school and feel so grateful.” Ashley was on a machine to buy time when, thankfully, a donor was found.  In 2015, she had a new pair of lungs and is indebted to her donor and their family for the chance to see Emerson, now four, grow up. Ashley, of South London, said: “Their selflessness has transformed my le beyond my wildest dreams.” Libby Clare, 22 Diagnosed at two, psychology intern Libby could manage her condition relatively well. But at nine, problems began when she got an infection that slowly ate away at her lungs. Her lung  declined and at 16 she found herself in hospital more and more. But Libby pushed on, leaving her Cambridge home for the University of Southampton in 2014 and going Interrailing after getting approval from doctors.  But a week into the trip she collapsed. A CT scan found she had very severe pneumonia. As it developed into chest sepsis, she was in and out of hospital for eight months. Her medical team got her on a trial of Orkambi – a drug campaigners want made available on the NHS.  It let Libby grow strong enough to be considered for a transplant and she had the 14-hour op in May 2016. She said: “If this buys me one more year, it’s still longer than I would’ve had. The best way I can honour my donor now is live my le to the full.” Josie Stewart, 25 After chest infections and a struggle to gain weight, Josie was diagnosed aged two. Initially doctors thought she was just behind in hitting milestones because she had been born prematurely with her twin Tommy, who does not have cystic fibrosis. At three she began receiving intravenous antibiotics and was tube-fed. “Childhood involved chest physio and nebulisers, even when I was well,” she said. Aged 22 and a fashion student, Josie started to decline – which she knew could happen but never thought it would be so rapid.  Before she knew it, she was on oxygen 24/7, clinging to le. In March 2016, Josie was listed for a transplant and put on an ECMO machine, where blood is removed and then pumped back into the body so it bypasses the heart and lungs, allowing them to rest. Then in July that year Josie, from South East London, got the call for a lung transplant. “I know false alarms happen so I’d resigned myself to the fact it may not go ahead,” she said. “Then, suddenly, doctors were in my room, telling me we were good to go.  “I’d been having panic attacks but being wheeled to theatre, I felt remarkably calm.” Medics later found a bleed on her lung they wanted to monitor so Josie was kept asleep for a few days after surgery. On coming to, doctors switched off her oxygen to see how she’d react. She thought she was still hooked up to the machine until they told her: “It’s you. You’re breathing.” Josie said: “It was really emotional.”  Charlotte Davies, 24 Charlotte’s weight fell as a newborn and she failed to thrive. A sweat test at three weeks revealed she had cystic fibrosis. From two, she had three-monthly intravenous antibiotics at and she was tube-fed from three. She said: “I tried my best to get on with things. My family were always careful to teach me that my health shouldn’t hold me back.” At 13, Charlotte, now a TV production assistant, began to lose weight and her lung  declined. By 16, it was just 26 per cent.  After spending the last five weeks of her GCSEs in hospital, a transplant was mentioned in February 2010 but she did not feel ready. Her lung collapsed two months later. By September she was on oxygen 24/7. She went on the waiting list and got the call ten months later. Doctors showed Charlotte, of Dover, Kent, her new lungs on a screen.  She said: “My old ones had been blackened, these were pink and healthy. I remember the first proper breath I took. “I’d never known what it was like to take a properly deep breath before.” Sharon Brennan, 37 Born with cystic fibrosis, health journalist Sharon suffered with persistent infections. Eventually they caused irreparable damage to her lungs, leaving her in need of a le-saving transplant. And five years ago, in August 2013, she received her new organs.  Speaking of the friendship she has forged with the other women, Sharon, from South London, said: “It was incredible to meet my tribe – we are all at dferent stages of le but all determined to make the most of our second chance. “And it’s nice to be reassured on the tough days that they are all there to talk to, whenever needed.” Holly van Geffen, 26 Holly was diagnosed at six weeks. With physio and support from loved ones she felt relatively well until 14. Then an infection meant she needed intravenous antibiotics every three months. At 18 she suffered a collapsed lung.  Doctors raised the idea of a transplant but Holly, a print designer from Leicester, was afraid. Then, just before she was 21, a friend and fellow cystic fibrosis patient died. Holly said: “I wasn’t far off being as poorly as her so it really woke me up.” She went on the list at 22 and had the op in 2015.

Her sugar daddy is a senior executive in a company in Brussels and her mum has given the relationship her blessing, she said. Stephany added: “We both said at the outset what we wanted. It works very well because there is real affection on both sides.” RichMeetBeautul, which is based in Norway, sparked outrage when it launched in the UK with an aggressive advertising campaign last November. Giant billboards at colleges showed a couple cuddling with the words “romance, passion and no student loan, go out with a sugar daddy”. Its success comes as students borrow more than ever, with almost four in 10 thinking of quitting over cash worries. Stephany said: “People need money to get an education and have some kind of le when they are studying.

One primary school pupil brought in a pork pie and a can of shandy. He made the lunch himself because “that’s all there was in the fridge” he told the teacher in Halax, West Yorks. Another was sent in with a can of Red Bull and a bag of Monster Munch corn snacks. A teacher in Leeds said a child arrived with a packet of ginger biscuits explaining mum had been “too tired” to go to the shops. She also questioned the mother of a pupil with a can of Red Bull and was told: “He’d had a late night on his Xbox and seemed like he needed a pick-me-up.” A member of staff at a school in Birmingham was sent to school with a Happy Meal box with a cold McDonald’s burger and fries. Their gran explained it had been bought the day before but the pupil hadn’t wanted it so it was a “shame for it go to waste.”  In Manchester a teacher found an eight-year-old lad had grabbed a can of dark fruits cider thinking it was a soft drink. A child with no packed lunch or cash for a meal said he’d had cereal with water on it for breakfast because “mum needed the milk for her coffee.” The teacher – one of dozens sharing stories on Facebook – said: “I’m not ashamed to say I cried when he told me that.” Staff in primary schools monitor packed lunches.  Unhealthy or unsuitable items can be confiscated and handed to parents at the end of class – instead children get a free school meal worth around \u0026pound2.20. The NHS’s Change4Le healthy eating campaign advises parents making packed lunches to include a healthy sandwich or wrap, a piece of fruit, a treat like a jelly or malt loaf and a bottle of water or sugar-free drink.

It is a few days away, but we do have weather warnings in force. “Please stay tuned to the forecast. Things could change. This could be a very powerful storm. In the northern Philippines, 14 people were killed as a 115mph typhoon ripped through the main island of Luzon. Road and bridges were closed and thousands were evacuated. Two rescuers died trying to help people trapped in a landslide. Last night it was heading for Hong Kong.  Back in the UK, the Met Office has issued severe weather warnings for wind across north-west and south-west England, Scotland and Wales from tomorrow night until Tuesday lunchtime. But the “tropical” nature will mean the mercury could rise to 30C after the weekend.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said the level-one yellow alert may be upgraded depending on the storm’s path and severity. He said: “The UK’s weather will come under the influence of ex-hurricane Helene although other systems in the Atlantic may mody this \u0026shyparticular one. There is a warning out from Monday night, with Helene expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain mainly across western Britain through Tuesday morning.” Among the dead in the States is a mum and her child killed when a tree hit their home in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Essentially this means they cut out all animal products from their lestyle - including, meat, fish and dairy.  And while there has been a rise in vegan products in supermarkets of late, those opting to follow this diet, were missing out on one crucial treat.  Magnum ice creams.  The chocolate covered ice creams on a stick are a staple of British summer time, but have been off-limits to vegans due to their heavy use of dairy.  Or at least they were off-limits, until now.  After testing their vegan ice creams out in Finland and Sweden and receiving two big, enthusiastic, thumbs up of approval, Magnum have decided to launch their vegan products in UK supermarkets.  A box of three ice creams can be purchased from Tesco for \u0026pound3.89.  However they only currently come in two flavours, classic and almond. The classic has a creamy centre and is encased in a chocolate coating, while the almond had the added bonus of pieces of nuts embedded in the chocoalte.  Magnum prides itself on using chocolate from Rainforest Alliance Certied farms on all their ice creams and the vegan ice cream is made from a dairy free pea protein certied by the European Vegetarian Union. People on Twitter have gone crazy over the vegan sweet treat. One person said: Eating new vegan magnum ice cream it’s so good I’m screaming. Another posted: Vegan Magnum ice-creams launched today and Hellman’s vegan mayo coming soon... what a time to be alive! Anything that makes plant-based options more accessible and appealing to all is brilliant. I’m excited. The speed of change is breathtaking.

And eventually the condition causes your body to deteroriate until the only option is a lung transplant. That’s a major operation – but almost worse is the waiting. That’s where the Transplant Girls came together.  They formed a group on social media to offer each other reasurance and encouragement. The first of them to have an operation was Charlotte in 2011.The last was Josie in 2016. During that time they built up a special unbreakable bond. Strict rules around cross-infections meant coming face to face was out of the question. But they finally got together earlier this year. It sounds like a normal girls’ afternoon out – a restaurant and a bottle of wine. But for these women it was a celebration of determination. It was also a time to reflect on the other heroes of their story – the donors. Because the magnicent seven are here now thanks to them. It means Ashley, who was diagnosed when she was two, will see her little boy grow up. All the women are backing our campaign to encourage people to sign up as donors.

Juan David Ortiz, an intel supervisor for the Border Patrol who has worked for the agency for 10 years, was arrested overnight on Saturday in a parking lot in Laredo, Texas. He fled police after the fth woman he abducted escaped and informed authorities.   The Texas Tribune reports that officials found him hiding in a truck near a gas station close to a Laredo hotel  and arrested him without incident. The killing spree is thought to have taken place over the last two weeks.   Webb County Sherf Martin Cuellar said that authorities have “very strong evidence” to link Ortiz, 35, to the crimes, and called him a“serial killer.” Webb County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said: The suspect was hunting for his victims. We do consider this to be a serial killer.  Alaniz told The Texas Tribune that the fth woman Ortiz picked up quickly realized that she was in danger.  “He picked [the fth woman] up, she went willingly with him and then while she was with him things started to get dangerous for her and when she tried to escape from him at a gas station that’s when she ran into a trooper,” Alaniz said.  In our opinion he is the sole person responsible for this horric serial killing spree. He said that authorities believe Ortiz had killed all four women since September 3 while he was off-duty. Authorities believe he acted alone and the motive is not known at this stage.

Florence\u0027s intensity has diminished since it roared ashore along the US mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane. But its slow march over the two states, crawling west at only 2 miles per hour , is expected to leave large parts of the region deluged in the coming days. This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news briefing. His state has already endured record rainfall, with much more forecast to come. Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said.  This is a hurricane event followed by a flood event, said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. With flood waters advancing rapidly in many communities, stranded people were being rescued by boat and by helicopter, while tens of thousands of others hunkered down in shelters. Numerous roads were closed, and authorities warned of the risk of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled.  Utility crews worked to restore electricity. As of Saturday afternoon, about 752,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina, along with 119,000 in South Carolina. Helicopter crews have carried out dozens of missions in coastal North Carolina and helped in the rescue of 50 people and eight pets, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the US Coast Guard.  At 5pm EDT , the National Hurricane Center said Florence had maximum sustained winds near 45 miles per hour. It said it was located about 60 miles west of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and forecasters predicted a slow westward march.  The centre said the storm would dump as much as 40 inches  of rain along coastal areas of the Carolinas, as well as up to 10 inches in southwestern Virginia. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people about 90 miles inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes because of the flood risk. If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like noty your legal next of kin because the loss of le is very, very possible, Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference.  Officials said there had been at least seven storm-related fatalities in the state, with the total across the US east coast now at 13. In South Carolina, a woman was killed when her vehicle struck a fallen tree. Two people were killed in a house fire in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Officials said firefighters were unable to quickly enter the building due to the storm.  In Wayne County, an 81-year-old man died on Friday after falling and striking his head while he was packing to evacuate. The storm made landfall on Friday near Wilmington, a city of about 120,000 squeezed between North Carolina\u0027s Atlantic coastline and the Cape Fear River.  On Saturday, its streets were strewn with downed tree limbs and carpeted with leaves and other debris. Electricity remained out for much of the city, known for its historic mansions, with power lines lying across roads like wet strands of spaghetti. The fact that there haven\u0027t been more deaths and damage is amazing and a blessing, said Rebekah Roth, walking around Wilmington\u0027s Winoca Terrace neighbourhood. Florence has already set a North Carolina record for rainfall totals, exceeding that of Hurricane Floyd, which struck in 1999 and caused 56 deaths.  Floyd produced 24 inches of rain in some parts of the state, while Florence has already dumped about 30 inches in areas around Swansboro. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. Some area residents described a harrowing retreat as the storm hit. It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind, said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later drove through torrential rain and high winds from her home near New Bern.  More than 20,000 people were in 157 shelters in North Carolina, with nearly 6,000 in South Carolina shelters, officials said. South Carolina authorities said law enforcement officers were guarding against looting in evacuated areas, while Wilmington set a curfew on Saturday evening in response to looting in one area. Schoolteacher Leslie Ochoa said she and her family loaded up 10 adults, 5 children, 14 goats, 10 dogs , two cats and one guinea pig and evacuated from Jacksonville, North Carolina to Columbia, South Carolina last Tuesday.  As her son fed the goats in a hotel parking lot, she said she might not be able to  home until the middle of next week. Our friend behind our old house, they have gators swimming in the water. So yeah, not safe, Ochoa said.

A passenger on a Ryanair flight from Ibiza to Madrid filmed the thief in action before alerting an air steward.  Police got the man to confess before ing the stolen item back to its rightful owner - a teenage boy travelling to the Spanish capital with his mum. The baggage handler, who worked for the airport not Ryanair - is now facing trial and had only started his job three days earlier. He is thought to have been sacked.   Footage of his crime - published by island paper Diario de Ibiza - showed him opening the case on a luggage trolley before rooting around inside with one hand and then putting the red speaker in his left trouser pocket.  The extraordinary incident happened on Friday morning. The woman who had bought it for her son told Diario de Ibiza: The police told me it was the third day the man had been working at the airport and ed the speaker to me immediately. I was very grateful because I had bought it for my son’s birthday.  But it\u0027s not the first time airport staff in Ibiza stirs outrage. Shocking footage last month showed a baggage handler throwing passengers’ suitcases around like they were footballs. He was heckled by holiday-makers who from the plane saw him throwing suitcases several feet up in the air and onto a truck. The staffer also hurled a pushchair across the tarmac before driving off with one bag stuck under the wheels of his truck.

The victim was left with a string of injuries after her ordeal and is barely able to speak, according to her mother. It has emerged that the suspects knew the girl and her family and had been following her in the run up to an apparently well-planned attack. The identity of the one of the suspects, a soldier in the Indian army, has caused further outrage. If an army personnel is involved in the crime we will ensure that the person is caught and booked for rape. We do not shelter criminals, Lt Gen Cherish Mathson told NDTV.  The girl was abducted on Wednesday morning in Mahendergarh, in the northern state of Haryana, after two of the accused saw her at the bus stop. They offered her water which she believes was spiked and then put her in a car. She told police she was taken to a house about 25 miles  away where a number of other men arrived. The gang then took it in turns to rape her, according to The Times of India. She was eventually driven back to the bus stop and dumped. One of the men phoned her family and told them to collect her. Three of the alleged attackers have been identied as Pankaj, who is in the army, Nishu and Manish. There have been no arrests yet but police have released pictures of the three men in an attempt to find them. The victim is in a local hospital where she has been treated for injuries to her back, shoulders and genitals, according to The Times of India. Her mother told the paper: She has severe pain in her throat, and is unable to talk or swallow anything. They probably held her by the throat, which led to this pain.

The jersey sits alongside stuffed bears and gts from Joseph Stalin, Robert Mugabe, Muammar Gaddafi, Fidel Castro and Vladimir Putin. The International Friendship \u0026shyExhibition was built by current leader Kim Jong-Un’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, as a monument to brainwash North Koreans into believing there is “worldwide support for the government”. The Mirror was granted exclusive access during an eight-day visit to the secretive country. But first, our man was issued with a white glove before being allowed to open one of the four-ton doors – last touched by Kim Il-Sung when he opened the exhibition in 1978. Inside the grand building, around 100 miles east of capital Pyongyang and close to Myohyangsan mountain, lies an astonishing collection of disturbing artefacts. More than 115,000 pieces from 188 countries cover six marble floors in this twisted museum of propaganda which proclaims the gts as “proof” that Korean leaders “are revered and admired around the globe”.  There are gts of rhino horn from former Zimbabwe dictator Mugabe in 1985, a golden sword from Libyan tyrant Gaddafi in 1986 and a bulletproof limousine from Soviet leader Stalin in 1950. A crocodile-skin suitcase came from Cuba’s Fidel Castro and a silver tea set from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2001. Three limited edition Spalding basketballs, a gt from former NBA star Dennis Rodman, are behind a huge glass case. Rodman has met basketball-obsessed Kim at least three times since 2013. On his second visit there the star gave Kim a signed jersey from the Harlem Globetrotters, who performed for him in North Korea in 2013.  One room features huge portraits of Kim with world leaders – including a powerful image from his June summit in Singapore with US President Donald Trump. There are stuffed polar bears and towering brown bears – gts from firms in China and Russia. Guarded by henchmen with gleaming silver Kalashnikovs, the centre opened on August 26, 1978, and consists of over 150 rooms covering a huge area of 70,000 square metres. Our guide is Han Jong-Suk, a lady in her 60s with a sweet smile. She proudly tells how she devoted her le to caring for the exhibition so that she could educate the people of Kim’s “great standing” in the world.

Speaking through a government minder who tracked our every move in the country, she said: “I have worked here for 40 years and it is my le’s work and honour. “The exhibition demonstrates for the world to see how respected our great leaders are and how supreme leader Kim Jong-Un is admired as the greatest leader in the world.” As our tour continues two lesize waxwork figures of Kim Il-Sung and his son and heir, Kim Jong-Il, come into view. We are beckoned forward and instructed to bow “in respect”.  Among vastly extravagant gts are more subtle suggestions that this is a place belonging to an alternate reality. A letter of support to Kim Jong-Un from US musician Pras Mich\u0026eacutel, founder of R\u0026ampB band the Fugees, is given prominence. And in another corner, under the banner UK, is the signed Wigan Warriors rugby league jersey and ball, sent in 2014 by the UK arm of the Friends of North Korea.  Our guide tells an outrageous story that US President Jimmy Carter, after meeting Kim Il-Sung in 1984, ed home and “told the American people that Kim Il-Sung was a greater leader than all of George Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln”. Then our minder bizarrely turns to us and says: “Do you believe in the impossible?” As we push open another huge door on the third floor we enter a giant room with a twin propeller plane – a gt from Russia in 1958 – perched in the centre.  Our guide suggests that the plane flew into the room to land... rather than being assembled right there. But then this is North Korea, a land where the lines are often blurred between reality and fiction.

I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out. Still, seven points from the last nine after a tricky start to the season is not too bad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united pair fyvie and king continue on their road to recovery","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United pair Fraser Fyvie and Billy King continued their comebacks from injury in the Reserve League Cup on Tuesday.The two made their first appearances of the season in the Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Alloa at the weekend.After coming on late on against the Wasps, this time club captain Fyvie and winger King were both given the full first half.That puts them well down the road to a first-team , though it would be a major surprise  either were to feature in Saturday’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice.After being out since Christmas, Fyvie, in particular, is likely to continue his build-up in the reserves for another couple of weeks.The plan for him is to have him back only once he’s completed a full game for the second string.Their presence saw them help the Tangerines to a 2-1 win over Saints, though both United goals came late in the second period.Matty Smith, with his second goal in two games, levelled after Saints had gone ahead through Jordan Northcott.United then sealed the points from the opening group game when Louis Appere struck 18 minutes from the end.United, meanwhile, have switched their crucial Championship clash at Partick Thistle next month.The game was originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 30, but with both teams’ interest in this season’s Irn-Bru at an end, they’ve brought it forward to Saturday, October 13, with a 3pm kick-off.As well as suiting fans, it means both teams will avoid a three-game week at the end of the month.Had United progressed in the Irn-Bru they would have faced Dunfermline in the third round.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/KMIL2669.JPG-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"ray mckinnon dundee tried to punt ex captain darren odea to falkirk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Falkirk manager Ray McKinnon has revealed the deadline day madness at the Championship strugglers – and even had a Dundee defender offered to him with just minutes to go till the window slammed shut.The former Dundee United boss was only in the door for a few hours after his shock switch from Greenock Morton.McKinnon managed to seal a deal for Rangers striker Zak Rudden on loan but narrowly missed out on former Tannadice loanee Anthony Ralston.He also revealed Dundee boss Neil McCann offered the services of former skipper Darren O’Dea as the clock ticked towards midnight.McKinnon said: “We had Darren O’Dea getting punted to us at 10.30 at night by Neil McCann.

Across the road, in Slessor Gardens, celebrations to mark the opening continue with the second day of the 3D Festival.The event will feature a host of on-stage performances and a number of family activities.Things kick off at 11am as musician SHHE – otherwise known as Su Shaw or Panda Su – takes to the stage.She said: “Dundee is special – it doesn’t show off in ways that other cities do – so maybe in the past you had to work harder to find that out.“I’m excited to be joining some incredible local artists on-stage to celebrate its opening.”Keeping the music going from 11.50am will be Kashmir Crows, a six-piece based in the city.The group – who have been likened to bands such as Arcade Fire and Black Keys – play a mix of alternative rock, indie, soul, blues and funk, and are a familiar act on the local music scene.Lead singer Ian Black, from Lochee, said: “We pride ourselves on being a Dundonian band and to be a part of the biggest cultural event in Dundee for generations, we’re totally over the moon. We’ve been rehearsing and have just played at the Glenfiddich Festival Experiment so we’re on a roll. We can’t wait to play for everyone.”Dundee two-piece St Martiins are next up, performing a set at 12.40pm. Featuring Katie Lynch and Mark Johnston, they claim to have crafted a “unique sound” through music “laced with dark tones”.Katie said: “The V\u0026ampA is bringing something new to the creative scene here in Dundee, which has been needing a good refresh. We’re extremely lucky as a band and I want to see more people get the chance to get involved in the music business. Today’s going to be great – we’re so happy that we were asked.”At 1.30pm is Andrew Wasylyk, the alias of Dundee writer and producer Andrew Mitchell.He describes his work as being “cinematic nostalgia” with “elements of Baroque pop and the influence of classic 1970s songwriters”. Andrew said: “It’s a privilege to be involved and to play a small part in the opening of this new chapter for the city. I’m a fan of Kengo Kuma’s architecture and I’m excited to see the V\u0026ampA evolve and grow with the local communities. I’m really looking forward to performing with a nine-piece ensemble.”Kyle Falconer  – frontman of The View – is the most familiar name on the bill and he will appear on-stage at 2.30pm. The Dryburgh lad has been on tour promoting his debut solo album No Thank You of late, and is expected to perform hits from that LP along with a few well-known tunes from the band that made him famous.Another familiar face appears at 3.30pm in Be Charlotte  – the stage name of local singer Charlotte Brimner.She continues to make a name for herself, having signed a record deal earlier this year and performed last night before Primal Scream on the first day of the 3D Festival.Rounding the day off will be Danny Wilson icon Gary Clark, who’ll play a solo set to his hometown from 4.30pm before being joined by Sistema – the children’s schools orchestra – at 4.50pm to bring the festival to a close. Gary found fame with hits like Mary’s Prayer – which is expected to get an outing today.Organisers say the festival is all-standing and entry is via two gates on Thomson Avenue.Those attending aren’t allowed to take food or drink but outlets will be available.There will be a host of other activities taking place at Slessor Gardens, including a special event involving The Beano – where children can complete a comic cell in an attempt to break a world record.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b98d992afff4-417x564.jpg ","title":"wins can have dundee united ready to host the teams from the north","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the early-season jockeying for position continues in a Championship that’s, so far, living up to predictions it will be the tightest for years, Dundee United can do themselves a lot of good by winning their next two games.Even  the last league outing ended in the minor disappointment of a draw at Alloa, there’s no denying, since their early-campaign troubles in the Betfred Cup, the past few weeks have seen the Tangerines show steady signs of improvement.The last three outings have produced two wins plus that draw and, in a ision where after just four rounds of fixtures only one team, Inverness Caley Thistle, remains unbeaten, that can be put down as a decent run of form.And,  United can extend that to five games without loss via victories over Morton at Tannadice this Saturday and at Falkirk a week later, there’s every chance they’ll be the form team in the second tier.If that is so, it would be a case of good timing because at least two of the three games that will follow could prove to be among the most crucial of the campaign.That run will see them come up against both Inverness and Ross County and, as tight as the table looks just now, it is signicant the Highland pair currently occupy the top two positions.Coming down from the Premiership and with the backing of mega-rich owner Roy McGregor, County were always expected to mount a strong challenge to  to the top flight.It’s been a case of so far so good, though they did go down 2-1 at Morton last time out in the league.And before arriving at Tannadice on the 29th of this month, their quality will be further tested by a visit to in-form Queen of the South this weekend and a derby against Inverness the following week.That the team from the Highland capital are also looking strong will come as no surprise to those who know the Championship.Although they didn’t even make the promotion play-offs last term, many at that level felt between Christmas and the end of the season Caley were the strongest of the 10 teams.They’re coming to Tannadice in just over a month, almost exactly a year to the day since their impressive victory would mark the end of Ray McKinnon’s time in charge of the home team. While a win for Caley this time is unlikely to produce the same course of events with current United boss Csaba Laszlo, it would be a major blow to his hopes of guiding the team to promotion.Sandwiched between those encounters with the teams from the far north, will be a trip to Ayr United and old boss Ian McCall.Long since recovered from a dficult period at Tannadice, over the past three years he’s worked wonders at Somerset Park, twice winning promotion to this level.His team were on fire at the start of the season, most notably when they headed for Dens Park in the Betfred Cup and destroyed Dundee 3-0.The Honest Men’s last league outing saw them come back down to earth with a bump as they crashed at Queen of the South in a 5-0 beating that included a 10-minute first-half hat-trick from Steven Dobbie.Over the next couple of weeks, it will be interesting to see  that was no more than a blip or an indication Ayr have been punching above their weight so far and, over the course of the season, will settle into their expected role of simply battling to stay in the ision.Whichever is the case, United will not expect anything they bring home from the southwest to come easy but,  it’s part of a haul of points from an extended good run, it will bode well for the remainder of the season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie

nod","story":"\u0026nbspAMBITIOUS plans for a cinema and small business hub in Cromarty have been given the unanimous seal of approval by councillors \u0026ndash despite mixed views from residents.The cinema, which will seat roughly 35 people, is to be built on a storage yard just to the east of the Slaughterhouse Cafe on the seafront.It was given the green light at this week\u0027 north planning applications committee.The project, a joint development by the Cromarty Estate and Cromarty and Resolis Film Society, had sparked a mix of comment from the public, with planners receiving 14 letters in favour of the cinema, seven against and a further two who aired neutral views.Those who wrote to support the project said the cinema would be a major asset to the community, save on the cost of travel to see films in Inverness and would provide an imaginative building on a vacant piece of land that is currently an \u0026lsquoeyesore\u0026rsquo.There were also hopes the small cinema would build upon the community\u0027 successful film festival and bring more people into Cromarty, while the small hub was praised for providing much needed office space for small businesses.Critics, however, questioned the location close to the scenic Links area, worried that there was not enough car parking on site, and argued that Cromarty already has a number of vacant and under-used buildings. They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Sunday 16 Sep 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117427.jpg","title":"Emergency teddy bears to help distressed children","story":"\u0026nbspAN army of more than 800 teddies will be used by emergency services across the region to comfort children in traumatic circumstances.The little bears were knitted and crocheted by people who donated them to the scheme which is run by police in partnership with the Safe, Strong and Free charity.Inspector Judy Hill said: \"We have been completely overwhelmed by the generosity of everyone who has given their time to knitting Trauma Teddies.\"You can be assured that your efforts will be put to good use providing comfort to children who need it across the Highlands and Islands.\"Teddies will be kept at police stations and in vehicles and officers will now have the option of giving a child one in the hope that it can provide a little comfort in what would be a dficult or upsetting situation.\"Once again I would like to thank everyone who has supported this initiative for your generosity \u0026ndash we are grateful to each and every one of you who has taken the time to knit or crochet a Trauma Teddy.\"Kerry Glen, project co-ordinator with Safe, Strong and Free said: \"We are delighted to launch Trauma Teddies with Police Scotland in Highlands and Islands.\"People have been incredibly generous the amount of teddies we have received has far exceeded our expectations.\"The teddies we have received have been fabulous and will help give comfort in upsetting situations.

Additional allowances are also paid for summer holidays, Christmas and birthdays.Foster carers do not have to own their own home and do not need to be married. They can also be single or living with someone, including in a same-sex relationship. They can be from any ethnic background.Training and support is provided.For more information on fostering, contact 01463 702743 or email fostering@highland.gov.ukSunday 16 Sep 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117425.jpg","title":"Gay parade plan for Inverness prompts petition","story":"\u0026nbspHUNDREDS of people have signed a petition opposing a planned parade in Inverness city centre to celebrate gay culture, describing it as unsavoury and deeply offensive.The organisers of Proud Ness, set to take place on October 6, have applied for permission to stage a march along High Street to Eden Court Theatre.But Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , has gathered about 600 names on a petition opposing the parade on moral, religious and biblical grounds and also written a letter to Highland Council.Mr Morrison, of Old Edinburgh Road, Inverness, claimed in gay marches elsewhere members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender  community flaunted their immorality in the most extravagant ways imaginable.\"This becomes evident especially in city centres when they thrust lewdness in the faces of men, women and children alike by frolicking unashamedly on rainbow-coloured floats making obscene sexual gestures,\" he said.\"If this unsavoury event is given planning permission then these desperately sad scenes are now likely to be witnessed very tragically in Inverness on October 6.\"Mr Morrison said the city streets were public places and should be kept child-friendly, family-friendly and people-friendly but maintained this was not the case when immoral behaviour and lestyles were promoted in their spaces.The petition includes signatures from across the region including Ullapool and Skye,\u0026nbsp although Mr Morrison said most were from Inverness and included Christians and non-Christians.

He is the referee who sent me off at Celtic. It is what it is.“Devlin has a one-match ban and we have good enough players to fill in for him. Do I think it’s right? I don’t but we deal with it and move on.”Thomson has history with Aberdeen. Logan was sent-off by the whistler following full-time in the 1-0 win at Celtic in the final league game of last season.The Dons appealed Logan’s dismissal but were unsuccessful and the right-back was suspended for the first three domestic games of this campaign.Asked  the SFA outlined why they made the decision on his appeal, he said: “It was explained to me but my argument was explained to them. It was like an hour and a half on the phone with them.“People make their decisions down at Hampden.“I can only say my end of the story and you have a board that will decide what your fate is.“Looking back on it, it was so soft but you cannot cry over spilt milk so I get on with it.”Following the SFA’s explanation for upholding the Devlin red card, the Dons released a statement stating it was “unacceptable”.It also read: “It is imperative for the country’s football authorities to establish consistency and transparency in the appeal and referral process and will engage in dialogue with the SPFL in this regard to seek their assistance.”Aberdeen also insisted VAR needs to be considered.In recent weeks, Rangers’ Alfredo Morelos had a red for a kick at Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna downgraded on appeal to yellow.A three-man panel of ex-grade one officials also looked at a kick out from Rangers\u0026#8217 Allan McGregor at Kristoffer Ajer, of Celtic, and failed to reach a unanimous conclusion it was a red-card offence.Kilmarnock’s Gary Dicker had an appeal for a red card for a fair tackle rejected by the separate appeals panel which dealt with both Devlin’s and Morelos’ cases.Logan insists recent decisions have bred confusion. He said: “It seems like you don’t know what you can do these days that gets a red card.“With me, it was like what is tolerable? Do people think decisions are wrong? Definitely. It could have been resolved but they chose not to.”Logan accepts officials do have dficult tasks and in the cut and thrust of games, errors are inevitable. What should also be inevitable is that those mistakes are rectied on appeal. He said: “Referees do have a tough job.“However,  they get a decision wrong and it goes to where you can look at it again sometimes you still don’t get the right outcome.“There is no bad feeling towards referees.

If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cakes and coffee make a zambian difference","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/09/18, 3:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowZamScotEd, the Mid Argyll-based charity that supports education in Zambia, is close to achieving three of the UN’s sustainable development goals in Lusaka, where its secondary school is steadily growing.If you pop in to ZamScotEd’s next coffee morning in Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall, you will help to put the icing on the cake of St Columba’s third classroom block – the science building that will enable pupils to forge ahead and gain qualications to work in their country’s industries and professions.ZamScotEd founder, Marian Pallister, was back in Zambia this summer to check on the progress of the much needed secondary school the organisation initiated in one of the poorest communities on the fringe of Lusaka.She said: \u0026#8216Progress has been amazing. St Columba\u0026#8217s Community Secondary Day School opened in January 2016 with one classroom block match funded by Missio Scotland.Last year, with the help of the Spanish organisation Manos Unidas, the second classroom block opened and there was an amazing 100 per cent pass rate for the important Grade 9 exam – roughly equating to our Nat 5. Now, with funding from another Spanish organisation, Africa Directo, the science block has been built and ZamScotEd is committed to completing the interior and providing the furniture and equipment.\u0026#8217Marian added that Manos Unidas have just agreed to fund the fourth and final classroom block.There are now 190 pupils at the school, which is run by ZamScotEd\u0026#8217s Zambian partners, the Teresian Sisters, and there are 95 boys and 95 girls.\u0026#8216Our aims are to meet three of the UN\u0026#8217s sustainable development goals,\u0026#8217 Marian continued. \u0026#8216Goal number four is quality education, and head teacher Sr Veronica Nyoni and her team  are achieving that.\u0026#8216Goal number five is gender equality – and we\u0026#8217re spot on there. These two can lead to Goal number one, which is to eliminate poverty.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13243376.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_lhr_ayp_260418funky.jpg","title":"ayrshire clubbers could tv club","story":"NewsAyrshire clubbers could be on TV with Club MTV filmingMTV have launched a new channel - Club MTV - that films at the best clubs across the country.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet11:58, 14 SEP 2018NewsFurys nighclub in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailClubbers in Ayrshire will have the chance to show off their moves to the world.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her le now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a orced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no le, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my le was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horric surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service .\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of le, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots. It was answered and delivered by these two brave and ambitious local ladies, who with the community at heart, saved Innerleithen\u0026rsquos Post Office.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"photos-group-of-flamingo-chicks-hatch-in-oxton","story":"A GROUP of flamingo chicks have hatched at a Borders conservation centre.\nNews of the arrival of the Chilean flamingo flock was confirmed by Bird Gardens Scotland.\nThe newborns\u0026nbspwill form part of a new visitor attraction in Oxton, near Lauder.\nThe chicks hatched from eggs laid by the established Chilean flamingo flock at Chester Zoo.\nThe flock at Chester had a breeding success earlier in the summer, leading to a number of surplus eggs.\nThe eggs in question were incubated by the Bird Section in Chester prior to being carefully transported to Bird Gardens Scotland in Oxton, to hatch.\nIts not been confirmed how many chicks there are.\nFollowing on from hatching, the eggs will take 30 days to develop into healthy flamingo chicks, also known as flaminglings.\nMark Haillay of Bird Gardens Scotland said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an incredible moment when you first hear a flamingo egg grunt at you and you know that within 48 hours there will be a chick asleep, resting after its epic journey from inside the egg out into the world.\nLike many other types of bird, flaminglings have an egg-tooth on the tip of their beak which they use to gradually scratch and chip away at the shell creating an opening large enough for them to wriggle free of the shell and out into the world.\nThe flaminglings will be hand reared in Oxton, fed every two hours round the clock with a specialist liquidised diet fed through a syringe.\nThis mimics the beak-to-beak feeding which would occur in parent reared birds parent flamingos produce a rich saliva  and dribble this into the chick\u0026rsquos beak providing all the water, nutrients and energy they need to grow and stay healthy.\nMark added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos incredibly exciting to think these little balls of grey fluff will grow to be majestic flamingos. Rearing flaminglings is hard work - it takes the energy of both parent flamingos to rear just one chick.

in Glasgow they began touring once more in 2008 and 2009.\nThe re-release of Enter the Vaselines led to a tour of the United States and a booking to play Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona.\nA stunning new album Sex With an X was released in 2010, followed four years later by equally fantastic V for Vaselines.\nThe Vaselines toured with the likes of Future Islands and Mogwai as their

the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his

delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.

If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.

The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked  it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.  Following the meeting, Craig Ormond, director of Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, said: \u0026ldquoLethington Gardens already features Design Collection properties, so we wanted to ensure that these neighbouring houses have a similar look and feel in design terms. We are delighted that the council have agreed with us.  Lethington Gardens is part of a wider masterplan by a number of housing developers in the area.  The plans include a new primary school at the heart of the development \u0026ndash to be home to nearly 500 pupils \u0026ndash sport pitches and changing facilities, as well as a new park running east/west alongside the Letham Burn."},{"url":null,"title":"rugby-club-needs-cctv-after-licence-change","story":"  North Berwick RFC  applied to East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board for the licence, which allows it to welcome non-members to events.

They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.  The plans will be revealed for the first time on Tuesday at Haddington\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre.  The drop-in session, which runs from 3pm to 7pm, will allow members of the public to see the initial designs and also speak to members of the team behind the proposals. A second event takes place 6-8pm at East Linton Primary School on October 24.  Mr Rintoul added: \u0026ldquoThe National Museum of Flight is already a signicant component of East Lothian\u0026rsquos visitor economy and this investment will drive additional employment opportunities and help further stimulate the development of the area\u0026rsquos tourism sector.  \u0026ldquoThis is the next step in the development of the museum, which started with the arrival of Concorde in 2004 and has seen extensive investment in the site in recent years, including the creation of new exhibitions in 2009 and the restoration and re-display of two original Second World War hangars in 2016.  \u0026ldquoWe hope that residents will take the opportunity to come along to one of our two planned consultation events, view the design and discuss it with our team.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

His Bulgarian fiancee Mira Rojkan is among those to call on Mr Hunt to apply pressure on Turkey to rethink its treatment of the veteran, who is on bail in Kusadasi awaiting an appeal.  Rojkan, a law student in Leeds, was arrested alongside Robinson while they were on a family holiday last year.  The 23-year-old was given a suspended prison sentence for supposedly engaging in terrorist propaganda, for what she said was sharing pro-Kurdistan messages on Facebook.  She said the Bulgarian state provided her with more support than Britain has her fiancee.  \u0026ldquoThe UK should stop saying they can\u0026rsquot do it, we know they can.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said officials are ready to provide Robinson with further assistance, adding: \u0026ldquoWe have been following this case very closely and have raised it with the Turkish authorities.  The YPG is considered by Turkey as a terror organisation because of its links to the Kurdistan Workers\u0026rsquo Party which is fighting for autonomy for the region.

Perth Sherf Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sherf Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My we Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my we woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My we was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"primal-scream-headline-festival-celebrating-amazing-va-dundee","story":"  Thousands of fans turned out on Friday to see the group top the bill on the first night of the two-day 3D Festival in the city\u0026rsquos Slessor Gardens.

There were also concerns raised about the overall level of funding for higher education.  One senior academic, who is part of the executive team of one of the nation\u0026rsquos leading universities, described the policy as a \u0026lsquoprop for the middle classes\u0026rsquo, and added that free university education was a \u0026lsquosacred cow\u0026rsquo in Scottish public le that could not be openly challenged.  :\u0026nbspNew industrial revolution means workers may never retire, warns Mark Carney  They also called for a \u0026lsquonational debate\u0026rsquo on the issue. They added that there was concern about the current system preventing the widening of access to higher education for those from low-income homes due to the limit put on the numbers of Scottish students at university.  The principal of another leading university, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: \u0026ldquoThe current funding model is unsustainable  we are going to get the level of investment we need to compete at the highest levels internationally and make sure we can take as many young Scots into higher education as possible in order to create a skilled population.\u0026rsquo  Free access to university puts an effective cap on the number of Scottish students that the sector can take in order to keep within Scottish government budgetary guidelines. In England and Wales, fees are around \u0026pound9,000 a year.  \"Funding is putting us in a dficult position,\" the university principal said. \"There\u0026rsquos been low investment from the Scottish government for over a decade now. It is time to look at a gradual increase in tuition fees for Scottish students - or at least consider it. A national conversation is needed.  \"It is dficult to have that conversation without it being politicised, and that dissuades constructive debate. We need to find a \u0026lsquosafe space\u0026rsquo where we can explore the pros and cons.  \"Is free education a good thing? Yes,  it is affordable, but no,  it is a challenge to sustain. A new model would mean more staff, more students and a better Scotland. Universities are places of innovation and we need innovation on this issue now.\"  Peter Mathieson, principal of Edinburgh University, said there was a \u0026lsquorisk of politicising education\u0026rsquo, adding: \"When it comes to the debate around tuition fees, my view is:  you want high quality education then it\u0026rsquos got to be paid for as it is expensive. Whether it is paid for by tuition fees, governments or loans, that is a debate we can have in society.  Mathieson said that the \u0026lsquorole of tuition fees versus other means of funding is very personal for me as I was the first member of my family to go to university\u0026rsquo. His father died young and his family did not have a lot of money, he said, adding that  there had been \u0026lsquotuition fees in my day then I think it less likely I would have gone to university\u0026rsquo.  Mathieson said he did not want the fear of debt to deter students from higher education. However, he said: \"The idea that we\u0026rsquove got to make sure higher education is attainable - for me that doesn\u0026rsquot immediately translate into an ideological argument over tuition fees.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a school leaver my ability to tolerate debt was very limited, the reality for a lot of school leavers now is that  they are going to go to university they need to be able to tolerate debt. I think that\u0026rsquos an issue we can\u0026rsquot hide from.  He added: \u0026rsquoI think university education without realistic estimates of what it costs is counter-productive. The idea that Scotland doesn\u0026rsquot want tuition fees I can live with, as long as there is a recognition that the money has to come from somewhere. What I don\u0026rsquot accept is that education is free, as it is not.\"  Mathieson said he wanted to see the contribution from the Scottish government increased. \"If we want more Scottish students at university and they aren\u0026rsquot going to pay tuition fees then that level of income needs to be increased.\"  He mooted more sponsorship from industry - including the armed forces. \"In own my field, medicine, the armed forces sponsor some students so you can have army-sponsored medical students who then commit to working with the armed forces after graduation.\"  Jim McDonald, principal of Strathclyde University, said that his institution delivered \u0026lsquosix times the investment from the government back into the Scottish economy\u0026rsquo, adding: \u0026ldquoI am sure the Scottish government understands the value of the higher education sector but  you look internationally there are many of our competitors both in Europe, America and Asia, which are really ramping up investment in higher education as they see it as a key component of growth.  \"This means in order to attract and retain the best academic talent and best students from home and abroad, we need to make sure that higher education is properly funded.  Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, principal of Glasgow University, said he supports the current policy by the Scottish government. Muscatelli said tuition fees are a \u0026lsquosocietal choice. \"What we see is that in developed countries, some chose to keep education free - like Scotland, Germany and Scandinavia. What you have to do is invest in the cost of higher education, and frankly we are happy with the investment that we are receiving from the public purse to educate home students. He said Scotland, Germany and Sweden all had \u0026ldquogreat universities. I think you have great publicly funded systems around the world that work very well.  Muscatelli, chair of the Russell Group of leading universities and a prominent economist internationally, added: \u0026ldquoOther countries, such as England, have gone another way, but let\u0026rsquos not kid ourselves, you see the debate in England - fees were introduced and now people are saying perhaps some of this should be publicly funded. Society will periodically go through this debate, but as long as universities are properly funded through the public purse I am perfectly happy with the situation.  John Swinney, the deputy First Minister and education secretary, said he \u0026ldquolooked at tuition fees through the lens of values. The values I associate with education is that society should benefit from collective investment in the educational development of our population - that is the moral purpose of education.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhat comes with that is a commitment to make sure that universities are properly and effectively funded, and that is the very firm commitment we have given to our institutions.  On comments that the effective cap on Scottish student numbers limited access to university for poorer students, Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot accept that point.

Mary Senior, the University and College\u0026rsquos Union Scottish official, said Scotland should not go down the same route as England when it came to tuition fees, and added that the effective cap on Scottish students was a \u0026ldquopressure that needed to be addressed."},{"url":null,"title":"ferries-out-of-commission-as-repair-work-is-underway-on-fleet-including-new-85m-vessel","story":"  One is the brand new \u0026pound45million flagship vessel MV Glen Sannox that was launched last year and is due to serve the country\u0027s busiest ferry route.  The other is the 35 year old MV Isle of Arran and still serves that route despite being well past its normal operational age.  But neither are currently carrying passengers across the Firth of Clyde from Ardrossan to Brodick on the isle of Arran as they are currently undergoing vital repair work in Greenock, although the MV Isle of Arran is due to be back in operation today .  Meanwhile, the route is served by the MV Caledonian Isles which has also had engineering works carried last week, with engineers making repairs during passenger-only crossings to ensure that people could get to and from the island on a drastically reduced timetable.  It comes after Scotland\u0027s main ferry operator, Caledonian MacBrayne, has been heavily criticised after a summer of disruption across the network due to breakdowns, with the average age of vessel on a leline route now 22 years.  Ferry passengers are now facing yet more disruption on CalMac\u0027s ageing fleet after the two new prototype vessels, the MV Glen Sannox and its sister ship, which cost \u0026pound100 million have been delayed yet again.  The dual fuel flagships were supposed to be with the ferry operator this summer and autumn, but are now expected next summer and spring 2020.  But the MV Glen Sannox now sits on the Clyde without funnels as engineers work on its bulbous bow - nearly a year after being launched by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.  It comes amid concerns that a 10-fold increase in traffic is already causing severe problems for island communities.  Tourism bosses on the Outer Hebrides have already warned the disruption has cost them millions of pounds already this year.  Stornoway businessman Louis Maciver says he could not sustain his business without reliable ferries.  Mr Maciver, co-owner of Techmobile, a tech company in Stornoway, said 98 percent of his deliveries come by ferry.  He said: \"We are totally reliant on them. For us it means we can get the latest games at the same time as they are released online. It gives us a chance to compete.\"  \"To say ferries are vital to our business - and every other business here - is an understatement. We need reliable services.  \"The mistake they made was ordering one big ferry to carry both freight and vehicles and passengers . They should have gone for two, smaller and quicker ferries which could have also helped ease the disruption in the event of breakdowns etc.\"  Ironically the four-year-old MV Loch Seaforth \u0026ndash the biggest and newest large ferry in the CalMac fleet \u0026ndash was not supposed to breakdown because three back-up engines aim to keep the ship going on her regular timetable and speed even  one of her two main engines breaks down.  But that did not prevent a major emergency in the Minch last month when the \u0026pound42 million ship lost power when a severe fault hit the engines\u0026rsquo cooling systems.  Marion Macleod, a lecoach and music teacher who lives in Stornoway, warns that she may have to move to the mainland.  She said: \"If there was no reliable ferry service I would leave. This summer has been the worst I can remember for disruption. These islands would not exist without ferries - they are our roads. What we need are services we can trust.\"  So far this year five ships on Clyde and Hebridean services have been out of service.  Islay, Harris and Uist have all hit by disruption, when the Hebridean Isles built in 1985, one of two ferries that normally serve Islay, was withdrawn to work on the Tarbert and Lochmaddy routes.  Newer ships, such as the MV Clansman, which services the outer Hebrides from Oban, were among those out of action.  The knock-on effect of vessels being redeployed proved to be a severe test for the 32 ferries that serve 51 ports on 49 routes.  Between January and the end of July this year, 2,326 out of 79,203 CalMac scheduled sailings were cancelled.  Of these, 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  Nigel Scott, spokesman for Western Isles Council, said the authority was meeting Scottish Government ministers soon to \"take matters forward.\"  He said: \"Obviously we have been expressing concern about the performance over the summer to the Scottish Government.\"  \"There has been undoubtedly disruption to thousands of passengers, businesses and the islands\u0027 economy. We rely on the ferries they are literally leline services for us.  \"We have argued for a two ferry solution on the Stornoway to Ullapool route - and right from the start. CalMac are not providing best value for money. There\u0027s a delay in new ferries which is disappointing and the new online booking system has not happened\".  \"Given the importance to communities and businesses in the islands these are serious issues which are impacting on the local economy and travelling public. It could be a factor in people moving away\".  Vice Convener of Highland Council Allan Henderson has also vented his frustration at the delay to the two new ferries being built on the Clyde.  Writing in this month\u0027s local West Word newspaper,he said: \"We have to give the Scottish Government credit for trying to get ship building going again in Scotland, but the decision to continue building super liners for island to mainland ferries, coupled with diesel/LNG technology instead of more nimble ferries that could shuttle back and fore and relieve at other ports has backfired.  \"Clearly the yard is not up to the task, with \u0026pound97 million now having been spent and a further \u0026pound30 million \u0027invested\u0027 to get two vessels fitted out, and that is long after they were due. Just think how many ships CalMac could have had at their disposal  conventionally powered 60 metre versions of the Coruisk  had been ordered with that money?  \"Another problem caused by this delay and extra financing is that the vessel replacement plan has also been set backwards with the contract having to be delivered on ever ageing vessels and absolutely no more vessels in the pipeline.  Last year, CalMac carried five million passengers, 1.5 million cars, 80,000 buses, and one million metres of commercial traffic.  Figures show the number of motorhomes travelling to the Western Isles has risen over the past decade, with nearly 2,000 heading to Harris alone.  The huge rise in tourists follows the introduction of a Scottish Government scheme to make island ferry fares more affordable.  The Road Equivalent Tarf bases fares on the cost of travelling the equivalent distance by road and was introduced to boost remote economies - and worked so well the number of cars on one route is up by more than 80 per cent.  But tourism operators in the Western Isles say they have lost \"millions\" from ferry disruption throughout the summer.  Outer Hebrides Tourism  said it saw \"no end to the critical issues caused by the continued unreliability of ferries to these islands as we end the season as it began - with disruption.\"  OHT previously costed ferry disruption to the islands\u0027 economy at \u0026pound6m.  Ian Fordham, Chair of OHT, said: \"Whilst the Scottish Government must now invest in CalMac to improve fleet resilience, they should also recompense our local businesses and invest in rebuilding confidence in the Outer Hebrides as a tourist destination after the negative economic impact of this summer\u0027s ferry fiasco! This has hit tourism business not just this summer but its future growth too.\"  OHT said ministers must address CalMac\u0026rsquos ageing fleet and its inability to move beyond the \"kne-edge on which it sits\" for service reliability.  Among its other complaints were that two new ferries were delayed \"with nothing else in a build pipeline.\"  Mr Fordham added:\"We continue to raise this signicant risk to the sustainability of our tourism businesses.The Outer Hebrides is a stunning place for tourists to visit and enjoy all year around but we want them to be able to get here and home again without disruption.  \"There has been a distinct lack of any visible action this summer from Transport Scotland and successive Scottish Government Ministers - as ministerial responsibility for ferries has changed three times in the past six months alone - to address this despite the local economic impact.\"  He said four new vessels - in addition to the ones under construction - or three plus a fixed link in the Sound of Harris, are required to provide a satisfactory service and room for the local tourism sector to sustain and flourish.  The First Minister has said she is \"determined\" to improve ferry services to Scotland\u0027s island communities in the wake of widespread concern over reliability.  Nicola Sturgeon said \"a range of work\" was ongoing to ensure that those living and working on islands \"have the services they deserve\".  She said: \"I am aware, as is the entire government about the pressures on the ferry network, we understand the impact that has on people\u0027s lives and businesses in our island communities\".  Ferguson Marine shipyard, where the Glen Sannox is berthed, were contacted for comment but did not respond."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-on-sunday-diary-grunts-screams-and-funny-names-it-must-be-the-work-of-the-hand-of-god","story":"  Watching last weekend\u0026rsquos US Open tennis final, the loud grunts coming from the players as they served and ed the ball sounded like two disgruntled jungle primates preparing to have a square go. However,  you were a mammal vocalisation researcher listening in \u0026ndash yes there are such people! \u0026ndash you would have been able to tell whether the winner was going to be Novak Djokovic or Juan Martin Del Potro and put your money on Novak to beat the bookies\u0026rsquo odds.  We know that grunting can distract an opponent \u0026ndash one Dutch player was once docked a point for counter-grunting \u0026ndash and can also help a player to hit signicantly harder, but predicting the outcome by grunt? Apparently so. Last year three such researchers at the University of Sussex published a paper in the journal Animal Behaviour entitled \u0026ldquoTennis Grunts Communicate Acoustic Cues to Sex and Contest Outcome. The conclusion was that, when winning, players\u0026rsquo grunts are lower pitched and losers pitch higher.  So  you\u0026rsquore a grunt aficionado you\u0026rsquod be able to confound the Ladbrokes algorithm and cash in. The lead researcher, one Jordan Raine, analysed 394 ying grunts from Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in the 2011 Wimbledon final and built his research from there. Nadal\u0026rsquos grunt apparently reveals \u0026ldquodeterministic chaos, akin to a motorbike erupting, while Djokovic\u0026rsquos ies a lot, but the one constant is something that sounds like a stled sneeze. Raine \u0026ndash where did he get the grant for this? That\u0027s what I want to know \u0026ndash also goes to drama schools to clock the sounds budding actors make when they\u0026rsquore told to imagine themselves in a war, or giving birth or falling from a tall building, or perhaps even being in a tennis final?  Raine, an Andy Murray fan, watched our boy in the second round of the US Open against Fernando Verdasco and knew from the first set it wasn\u0026rsquot going to end well because Verdasco\u0026rsquos pitch became lower while Murray just sounded like he was tired and wanted to go home to put his feet up. The denouement became inevitable when Verdasco served and loudly grunted what sounded like \u0026ldquoAu revoir. It was.  SCREAMS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE  Still in the strange but true and absolutely irrelevant category, going up to 11 on the Richter scale of sound effects, is the Wilhelm Scream, the most famous and most-used one in movie history, ululating in more than 370 films to date, from Toy Story to Star Wars \u0026ndash where Luke Skywalker shoots a Stormtrooper on the Death Star who falls off the edge \u0026ndash to Lord of the Rings and Reservoir Dogs.  The effect was called Wilhelm after the on-screen name of an actor who gives it out as he is hit by an arrow in the 1953 Western Charge at Feather River. But it was actually created two years earlier in a Raoul Walsh oater, Distant Drums, starring Gary Cooper, where a soldier is dragged underwater by an alligator and as he goes lets out the bellow. It was dubbed-on in post production by the musician and actor Sheb Wooley who was working on the film as a voice extra.  Wooley has never received proper credit for the scream, nor, I doubt, residuals for re-use. And he certainly shouldn\u0026rsquot get any credit for bringing out possibly the worst-ever song in popular music, The Purple People Eater. It was covered by our own teen pop star in a kilt, Leith\u0027s own Jackie Dennis, in 1958. And by Judy Garland.  In the trivia of unwanted facts useful only in a pensioners\u0026rsquo pub quiz it also went to Number One in Finland, recorded by British comedian Barry Cryer.  COLD COMFORT  The family-owned clothing company Johnstons of Elgin reports a record year in turnover and profits, and work at its mills in Hawick and Elgin is booming.  A growing liking for cashmere knitwear by customers in warm climates, like Panama and Dubai, is largely responsible, which seems like a bit of a contradiction in terms, not to say climates. But apparently it\u0026rsquos because shoppers frequent air-conditioned malls and  it gets a bit parky they pop into a shop and purchase a fleecy warm jumper.  International sales are up a whopping 30 per cent. The \u0026ldquooutstanding results were reported by the company\u0026rsquos managing director.

He was known as \u0026ldquoBungalow Bill because, while there was nothing up top, he was exceedingly well furnished below.  It\u0026rsquos not just royalty \u0026ndash sport, too, throws up many wonderful monnikers. There was the Reading football player Fitz Hall who was known as \u0026ldquoOne Size, for obvious reasons. Aston Villa midfielder Gilles de Bilde was \u0026ldquoBob.  The 1990s Spurs midfielder Justin Edinburgh was known as \u0026ldquoMusselburgh because it was just in Edinburgh.  The rugby player Martin Offiah was \u0026ldquoChariots. Of course. The Gloucestershire cricketer Paul Romaines was \u0026ldquoHuman. And when Ewan McGregor\u0027s brother was in the RAF his call sign was \u0026ldquoObitwo.  Then there was the diddy police officer called \u0026ldquoLaptop, because he was a small PC.

NEW ROLE FOR THE HAND OF GOD  On Wednesday last week, the French sports diary L\u0026rsquoEquipe published a rather cruel cartoon about Diego Maradona as the news came out that he\u0026rsquos been appointed manager of a Mexican side.  I\u0026rsquove been rather fond of him since witnessing his first international goal for Argentina against Scotland, of course, at Hampden Park in 1979.  It\u0026rsquos been all downhill since he stopped playing, with ballooning weight. He\u0027s also a recovering drug addict.  He also collapsed rather dramatically in a box \u0026ndash not the penalty one \u0026ndash watching Argentina against Nigeria in the World Cup in June. Now, rather strangely, he\u0026rsquos been made boss of Dorados, third bottom of the Mexican second ision. The club is based in Culiac\u0026aacuten, which is the home of the Sinaloa drug cartel. Perhaps he just wanted to cut out the middle men?  MILLAR\u0026rsquoS CROSSING  The professional cycling union, the CPA , is about as democratic as Stalin\u0026rsquos USSR, with Chris Froome calling it a dictatorship, joined by the present Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas firing his own broadside at the establishment.  The presidency is up for the vote in nine days with the incumbent, Gianni Bugno, going for re-election. Under the rules riders can only vote  they turn up to the meeting, which is in Innsbruck, and given the pro racing season is still going strong it\u0026rsquos not very likely that many will.  The sport has often been in the news for all the wrong reasons, or the pre-eminent one, drugs. In one of those gambits you might describe as setting a gamekeeper to catch a thief  step forward the challenger to Bugno, Scotland\u0026rsquos own David Millar.

The beard was not over, but massively pared down from the great, flowing fleece it once was to something a little sharper. Indeed, you can still see it now on Instagram posts by the model, who no lives in New York. Sometimes called the Bearded Scotsman, Millington was scouted in the streets of London by Urban Outfitters and has been a feature of fashion campaigns ever since.

Hitherto little-known, the Gaelic-speaking, Lewis-raised actress is now huge, and signed up for six seasons as shapeshter June McDaniel.

He shows us what you can do with a big warehouse  Andrew Fleming-Brown is also known as Mutley, the brains behind one of Scotland\u0026rsquos leading arts and music venues, SWG3. The father-of-two, married to model Lauren Tempany, started his career as a promoter and curator, but when, in 2005, a derelict site in a former Tobacco Bond warehouse became available, he jumped at the chance of taking it on. Thus SWG3 was born. But what exactly is it? It\u0026rsquos a clubbing destination, a caf\u0026eacute, a massive outdoor space called the Yard, a TV studio facility and much, much more. SWG3 regularly host the hippest art events, pop-ups and live gigs. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore unique, said Fleming-Brown last year. \u0026ldquoThat whole warehouse culture has been booming in London for ten years but we don\u0026rsquot really have anything else like that in Glasgow.  51 Pam Hogg  Designer  Why?

When they do, they instantly feel empowered. For Hogg is all about that female power. Her 2014 collection, Courage, was a tribute to the Russian activist collective Pussy Riot.  The post-punk designer started designing back in the early 1980s. Not content with just being a designer, however, Hogg has also done her time on stage as a singer and musician, and even supported Debbie Harry on the Blondie comeback tour.

There\u0026rsquos also an alternative scene of people hanging out, playing together and making more personal and experimental games. People like Malath Abbas, founder of the Dundee-based Biome collective in Dundee. Originally from Iraq, Abbas grew up in Liverpool and came to Dundee because of its thriving games industry. He believes games can be about so much more than what you can do with a screen.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom interested, he says, \u0026ldquoin the idea of taking games away from the screen and seeing the city a landscape as being playful. Biome collaborated on the spectacular sound and light installation at the V\u0026ampA opening party last week. Currently, they are working on a virtual reality game called Garden, in which the player plants neon plants that make music. \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore trying to create a VR experience that\u0026rsquos mindful, relaxing and is actually appealing to a broad spectrum of people, says Abbas.  49 Louise Rusk  Restaurateur, 37  Why? She\u0026rsquos queen of the Tomahawk steak  We all know veganism is cooler than cool. But, actually, so is meat \u0026ndash particularly when it\u0026rsquos grass-fed, hung-on the bone beef, dry-aged for 35 days. And nowhere does that quite like The Butchershop Bar And Grill, set up by Louise and her husband James Rusk, son of hair gurus Irvine and Rita. The former fitness professional, who toured the world as an Irish dancer at just 18 years old, is behind some of Glasgow\u0026rsquos coolest eateries, whether they be The Spanish Butcher or Hutcheson\u0026rsquos Grill, and they are as much about the style and design as the locally sourced food. Her own favourite meal? \u0026ldquoHas to be a Sunday Roast. Grew up with our family coming together every Sunday and we continue the tradition to this day.  48 Scott Reid  Actor, 25  Why? He is one of the best actors of his generation.  Scott Reid burst onto our television screens in BBC Scotland comedy series Still Game playing Methadone Mick, a recovering drug addict with a heart of gold and set of gnashers to rival the toothy grin of former footballer Frank McAvennie . The character, who debuted in 2016, became an instant favourite among viewers. When did Reid, 25, first get an inkling his star was on the rise? Well, there was seeing his face tattooed on a stranger\u0026rsquos leg. And people sharing pictures of themselves dressed up as him at Hallowe\u0026rsquoen. Oh, and a Glasgow bar named a cocktail in his honour. Further testament came when fans snapped up 10,000 sets of replica rubber teeth during the Still Game Live 2 shows at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow last year.  Reid, who hails from Paisley, has since gone on to roles in BBC police drama Line of Duty. He will  to our screens in the final series of Still Game this autumn and recently shot Amazon Prime sci-fi fantasy Carnival Row, which is due out in early 2019.  47 Val McDermid  Author, 63  Why? She remains the undisputed queen of crime  Sell as many books as Val McDermid has \u0026ndash 40 million or so \u0026ndash and you ought to be more establishment than cool. But somehow the Queen of Crime has never quite lost her alternative vibe, and with another novel featuring cold case detective Karen Pirie out last month she\u0026rsquos still firing on all literary cylinders. Meanwhile her plots continue to be highly relevant. Last year\u0026rsquos Insidious Intent, for instance threw a light on coercive control in a year in which the new Scottish domestic abuse law was being passed. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot do it with any sense of banging the drum, she explained in a recent interview. \u0026ldquoBut I do it because things come along that interest me and I think will interest my readers.  46 Talat Yaqoob  Feminist, 32  Why? She\u0026rsquos the powerhouse bringing equality to the workplace  If you want to know just how cool Talat Yaqoob is the best place to start is the forceful, funny and strident TEDx talk she did on \u0026ldquoreclaiming feminism back in 2014. \u0026ldquoImagine, she said, \u0026ldquo we and every one of us challenged sexism \u0026ndash it would cease to exist. Yaqoob has been fighting that battle ever since, and doing so in ways that are changing the climate in Scotland. She was a founder of Women 50:50, an organisation campaigning for equal representation and is now director of Equate Scotland, an organisation promoting women in STEM.  But Yaqoob didn\u0026rsquot come from a particularly political family. \u0026ldquoInequality isn\u0026rsquot something that we would have talked about in any academic way, it\u0026rsquos just something we lived \u0026ndash constantly. Her parents were immigrants from Pakistan who came to Scotland in the 1950s. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom first generation here she says, \u0026ldquoand being a woman, being a woman of colour, being a Muslim woman - all of those things, all of those experiences, come with the experience of inequality. Once you\u0026rsquove had your eyes opened to that, it\u0026rsquos not something that you can ignore.  45 Oli Norman  Entrepreneur, 42  Why? His Merchant City HQ has a Prosecco bar  One of the hippest things about Oli Norman is not that his itison, luxury deals website has been phenomenally successful, or that he\u0026rsquos married to presenter Cat Cubie \u0026ndash these things are quite cool \u0026not but that his company, last year was named one of the 100 best UK companies to work for. In other words, he\u0026rsquos the man behind Scotland\u0026rsquos coolest office, complete with complementary Prosecco bar, fairy-lit oak tree and yoga studio. \u0026ldquoThe itison office, he says, \u0026ldquois an experiment in breaking down the barriers between work and le.  But Norman also deserves a place on this list because of his support for the homeless. Itison\u0026rsquos fundraising feeds Social Bite\u0026rsquos entire programme over the whole year. We also like his work philosophy. \u0026ldquoI only choose, he says, \u0026ldquoto do things that I\u0026rsquoll find fun  things aren\u0026rsquot fun, we stop doing them. Simple.  44 Moyo Akand\u0026eacute  Actor  Why? She\u0026rsquos making films that tell black stories  When Moyo Akand\u0026eacute, and her sister Morayo, brought out their first film collaboration, 1745 it became one of the most-talked about short films in Scotland in years.  Inspired by real adverts published in 18th century newspapers for runaway slaves, it told the story of two sisters on the run from their Highland master.  But Moyo Akand\u0026eacute is about more than 1745. The daughter of Nigerian immigrants is making an impact in her industry on many levels. Earlier this year, she starred as a kick-ass thief in the disaster-movie, The Hurricane Heist, and this autumn she\u0026rsquos set to appear in The Cry, a television baby-abduction drama starring Jenna Coleman.  What we\u0026rsquore most looking forward to, though, is the Akand\u0026eacute sister\u0026rsquos planned feature version of 1745. \u0026ldquoWe saw, she said to us earlier this year, \u0026ldquothat there weren\u0026rsquot many challenging roles for women of colour in this industry. We put our heads together and thought  there aren\u0026rsquot those roles out there, we might as well create them for ourselves.  43 Kayus Bankole  Musician,30  Why? He\u0026rsquos hip, hot and now  It wasn\u0026rsquot surprising when Young Fathers won the award for Scottish Album Of The Year . Anyone who had heard Cocoa Sugar, by the hip-hop trio, probably saw it coming.  Besides, everything they do makes its mark. Back in 2014 they won the Mercury prize with their album Dead. Six of their songs were in last year\u0026rsquos T2: Trainspotting and defined the movie\u0026rsquos sound. This is also the second time they\u0026rsquove won SAY.  So, they\u0026rsquore indisputably cool \u0026ndash and really it\u0026rsquos hard to say which of the three of them is coolest. Here, we\u0026rsquove picked Kayus Bankole, but it could have been any member of this band that delivers a sound that is like no other. As James Milton wrote in the NME, \u0026ldquo\u0026lsquoCocoa Sugar\u0026rsquo isn\u0026rsquot a filtered version of what came before. Instead, it cements their status as riled-up oddballs determined to reinvent the wheel.  42 Vic Henderson  Chef, 41  Why? The chef\u0026nbspgave vegans the restaurants they deserve  Veganism is cool. But that\u0026rsquos not the only reason why Vic Henderson, the resident chef at The 78 Bar \u0026amp Kitchen, is cool. Henderson, who identies as non-binary, and goes under the pronoun \u0026ldquothey, had always cooked for the whole of their\u0026nbspfamily from an early age.  \u0026ldquoWhen I moved out, says the chef, \u0026ldquoI started cooking a lot when I was away with my bands or when touring bands stayed at my house. It would always be vegan and would always be like a big pot of something delicious.  Right now, Henderson\u0026rsquos plan is to open a fine-dining restaurant in Glasgow. \u0026ldquoI still think there\u0026rsquos a gap in the market for places to go that are next level for vegans and non-vegans alike. It would bring Glasgow up to the same standard as vegan destinations like London, Los Angeles and New York.  Henderson, who also worked up\u0026nbspMono in Glasgow and the Harmonium in Leith, sports some impressive tattoos, one of which is an armoured skeleton. \u0026ldquoI just got that from my friend Paul Clav\u0026eacute. He\u0026rsquos one of my favourite tattooists as he has the best chat when you get tattoos. You end up taking about veganism, toxic masculinity, gender issues, cool nieces or daughters, fat politics, period poverty, music, food and loads of other important stuff. Plus his drawings are badass!  41 Ervin Trykowski  Global whisky ambassador, 31  Why? He gives whisky that  Millennial vibe  Manila, Singapore, Sydney, Melbourne, Bali \u0026hellip the global whisky ambassador for Singleton whisky  seems like he\u0026rsquos been everywhere in the last year, and not just to pour a few drams either.  In Manila he was in a bar juggling spinning vinyl and providing a range of Scottish whisky cocktails. Trykowski who hails from Aberdeen and has a Polish grandfather, is giving whisky a vibe that is young and hip. As Esquire put it, \u0026ldquohe\u0026rsquos the Millennial man fronting the 180-year-old whisky maker.  The former bartender and mixologist, however, is always glad to get back home from his travels to his two French bulldogs, Bont\u0026egrave and Clyde. He also has a quirky obsession with badgers. \u0026ldquoOh, yeah, he says. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove got a big badger tattoo on the back of my arm. Don\u0026rsquot ask why, I can\u0026rsquot remember. I\u0026rsquom a big fan of the Mustelid family. The badgers, pine martens, stoats, weasels. I think they\u0026rsquore cool guys.  40 Clara McGregor  Model and photographer, 22  Why? She\u0026rsquos a rebel who out-cools her famous dad  22 years on from Trainspotting Ewan McGregor is now so huge it\u0026rsquos hard to see him as cool. But his daughter, Clara, now that\u0026rsquos a dferent matter.  The photographer and model is proving to be such a rebel she warrants a place on this list. Last autumn, she caught media attention when, following the break-up of her parents she tweeted that her dad\u0026rsquos new girlfriend was \u0026ldquotrash. In spring, her photos featured in Playboy, along with the headline, \u0026ldquoClara McGregor Isn\u0026rsquot Just Ewan\u0026rsquos Daughter. She\u0026rsquos Your New Crush.  What\u0026rsquos her grand plan? To be an actor, of course. \u0026ldquoHonestly, as she said to Playboy, \u0026ldquoI would love to play someone like Patti Smith\u0026hellip There are so many badass women who would be so cool to play. Lee Miller, who was one of the first female war photographers, is another.  39 Tom Walkinshaw  Space entrepreneur, 28  Why? He\u0026rsquos the man behind the world\u0026rsquos smallest, lightest satellites  Seven years ago Tom Walkinshaw was graduating in business studies at Glasgow Caledonia University, and thinking he might like to get a job in the space industry. Only there wasn\u0026rsquot that much of an industry in Scotland back then, so he decided to help start it. He created Alba Orbital and dedicated himself to developing the cheapest, lightest satellite.  These tiny devices are called picosats, just around a kilogram in weight, and are revolutionary. \u0026ldquoAlba really started to make it viable option for people, says Walkinshaw. \u0026ldquoThe industry doesn\u0026rsquot believe in picosats. This is an attitude that we\u0026rsquore overturning in a global way.  38 Eubha Akilade  Actor, 20  Why? She\u0026rsquos a time-travelling hit with teenagers across the globe  Unless you\u0026rsquore a tween, you probably haven\u0026rsquot heard yet of Find Me In Paris, but, filling you in here, it\u0026rsquos massive. It\u0026rsquos the latest big Nickleodeon tween show, a time-travel drama about an international dance school, and it features a cast from all over the world, one of whom is 20-year-old Eubha Akilade from Glasgow.  On only her third acting job after she was spotted in an open call audition for CBBC show Eve, she is hitting the big time. Akilade recalls that following her audition, she found out within weeks that she would be off to Paris, and living for six months in an aparthotel with a cast of actors. Sounds like a party waiting to happen? \u0026ldquoActually, no, she says. \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos surprisingly little of that. We don\u0026rsquot have time and have to keep ourselves in top form.  37 Gareth Williams  Entrepreneur, 49  Why? He had an idea in a pub \u0026ndash which made billions  Ask any tech-oriented entrepreneur who their hero is and many will say Elon Musk. Ask that same question to an entrepreneur in Scotland and chances are, they\u0026rsquoll say Gareth Williams, co-founder of Skyscanner.  He\u0026rsquos the man who made a digital boom in Scotland seem possible \u0026ndash and it all started with a drink in a pub between friends, and an idea generated because Williams was struggling to find cheap flights to the Swiss Alps.  Two years ago Skyscanner was sold to a Chinese company for \u0026pound1.4 billion in 2016. But the the early days of Skyscanner weren\u0026rsquot nearly so easy. \u0026ldquoIt was two years, Williams has said, \u0026ldquobefore we got our first revenue \u0026ndash we earned \u0026pound46 in one month. Yes, I miss those days but it\u0026rsquos easy to forget the struggle of the startup days. There\u0026rsquos a lot I don\u0026rsquot miss.  36 Dr Liberty Vittert  Statistician, 29  Why? She uses maths to predict the future  Statistics, boring? Not when they\u0026rsquore in in the hands of Dr Liberty Vittert, though even she says that at dinner parties she\u0026rsquos prone to saying that she\u0026rsquos a \u0026ldquodata scientist studying fake news rather than statistician. Anyone who has watched her TEDx talk, How To Win The Lottery And Get Away With Murder will know, however, that there are many good reasons to love stats.  Vittert grew up in the US, and currently has a post at the University of Glasgow. Among her projects is one working with the cleft lip and palate charity Smile Train to map the human face to help children with facial deformities. She is also working on a \u0026ldquofun TV show called Lies And Alcohol.  Remarkably, it turns out that, at school, Vittert wasn\u0026rsquot good at mathematics. When she was 14 years old a maths teacher called her parents into school to say that, as she puts it, \u0026ldquoI was too dumb to be there and was just simply not smart enough to understand basic math. \u0026ldquoI have the most wonderful mother in the world who decided to get me a tutor and spent hours helping me. I just needed to learn maths in a dferent way. Sometimes, I wonder who the dumb one was in that whole scenario.  35 Kyle Ross  Barber, 28  Why? Because those beards are winning  When last year, Kyle Ross, MD of The Huntsman barbers in Aberdeen, went to Nurnberg for the final of the International Barber\u0026rsquos competition, he won the trophy for best UK barber.  As ambassador for Hanz de Fuko, he\u0026rsquos also traveling the world and attending fashion weeks in London and Paris. But, actually, he doesn\u0026rsquot class himself as a barber. He\u0026rsquos more, he says, of a hairstylist. So, those Aberdonians heading to The Huntsman get the kind of attention that comes with that. He teaches them to maintain their style, or gives them one that suits their lestyle rather than what\u0026rsquos on trend.  34 Donald MacLeod  Club owner and charity chair  Why? The maverick music man is all about the charity these days  One thing you can be sure of is that given the bands that have played at his venues \u0026ndash Oasis, Queens Of The Stone Age, Pearl Jam \u0026ndash music promoter and club supremo Donald MacLeod must have some cracking tales.  Not long after he started The Cathouse, in 1990, he has said, he gave up being in a band and became a music promoter because he realised what the people wanted was short-haired indie kids, not long-haired rockers like him. He still has that hair and stylish dress sense \u0026ndash and the persistence almost makes it cool. but these days, as chair of Nordoff Robbins, the music therapy charity, he\u0026rsquos more about the power of music. He once said, \u0026ldquoI encourage all bands to put a bit back so why not to Nordoff Robbins, who use music to do good?  33 Judy Murray  Tennis coach, 59  Why? She showed us she was more than just Andy\u0026rsquos mum  Murray is not just cool because she\u0026rsquos mother to two outstanding tennis stars. She\u0026rsquos cool because somewhere in her fties, after years of having been nagged at by the media, she seemed to blossom.  It started with that fabulous appearance on Strictly Come Dancing and then it just snowballed, till last year, there she was getting a spider tattoo and publishing her autobiography, Keeping The Score. That spider tattoo says it all. The arthropod was a reference to the one Robert the Bruce saw struggling in a cave and her belief in \u0026ldquoperseverance and the rewards that come with endless effort.  Somehow she got through it all \u0026ndash and is no longer just Andy and Jamie\u0026rsquos mum, but a national treasure in her own right.  32 Mark Mackie  Director of Regular Music  Why? We\u0026rsquore loving those Summer Nights at the Bandstand in Kelvingrove Park  The bands may be cool but it\u0026rsquos Mark Mackie of Regular Music who brings them to us. Whether at Edinburgh Castle, Kelvingrove or Loch Lomond, he\u0026rsquos been delivering to us some of the industry\u0026rsquos biggest names.  In fact, he\u0026rsquos been doing that since way back when he was a student at Glasgow University, where, strangely enough, he studied marine science and zoology. For Mackie wanted to follow in the footsteps of his idol Jacques Cousteau, until he became entertainments convenor of the Queen Margaret Union and got into bringing the best of bands into town. Marine science\u0026rsquos loss, Scottish culture\u0026rsquos gain.  31 Lynne Ramsay  Film-maker, 28  Why? She\u0026rsquos a tough genius working in a hard industry  You\u0026rsquove got to hand it to Lynne Ramsay. Last year, at the Cannes Film Festival, she got a standing ovation, as well as prizes for best screenplay and best actor, for a film that wasn\u0026rsquot even finished.  The film, You Were Never Really Here, starring Joaquin Phoenix, arrived on the screen straight out of the sound-mix and the audience loved it. It was a comeback to quell all the doubters who thought that when she walked out of directing Jane Got A Gun, her career was over.  But, the really cool thing about Ramsay is she sticks to her guns, and true to her working-class Glasgow background is always direct.  \u0026ldquoYou know, she said in an interview this year, \u0026ldquoI grew up in a place where people appreciate it when you\u0026rsquore very direct. I think that helps cut through a lot of bullshit with filming. Straight talking and going on your instincts was important when I grew up.  30 Kapka Kassabova  Author, 45  Why? She took us to the edge of Europe  Kapka Kassabova\u0026rsquos Border: A Journey To The Edge Of Europe was a book that was hard to pigeon-hole. Was it a memoir? A travelogue? A meditation on history and a lost part of Europe?  One thing that the literary world could agree on last year was that the book \u0026ndash which won the Saltire and other awards \u0026ndash was a marvel. Kassabova lives in a cottage in rural Inverness-shire, but she grew up in Communist Bulgaria, and Border tells the story of her  visit to the border between Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece and the people she met there. She describes her books as \u0026ldquogenre-bending hybrids of narrative non-fiction. Currently, she is writing another book and travelling to Macedonia and Albania to visit the world\u0026rsquos oldest lakes. It will, she says, be a \u0026ldquojourney into an ancestral landscape through my mother\u0026rsquos family.  29 Danny MacAskill  Mountain biker, 32  Why? We never get bored of his bike tricks  \u0026ldquoI finally made it to Graub\u0026uumlnden, says Danny MacAskill in his most recent film as he poses on his bike on the top of the Swiss mountain, before catapulting off on one of his high-adrenalin rides. In the film, sponsored by Red Bull, it\u0026rsquos still the same old Danny, only the mountains are higher, the budgets are bigger, and, well, it\u0026rsquos hard for him ever to top the feeling that he gave us when he did his first street trials video back in 2009, or the romance he delivered when he cycled The Ridge.  But nevertheless, the boy from Dunvegan, Isle of Skye, still knows how to move us \u0026ndash and he\u0026rsquos always bringing us something new. He did so earlier this, in spite of a recent broken knee cap, when he performed in the Celtic Connections music and bike spectacular Bothy Culture And Beyond.  \u0026ldquoI suppose when you first jump on your bike it\u0026rsquos your first dose of freedom, he said in a recent film about his Kilimanjaro bike trip. \u0026ldquoYou can constantly think of something new to challenge yourself and it\u0026rsquos kind of like a game that you\u0026rsquoll never get bored of.  28 Anna Meredith  Composer, 40  Why? She took the Edinburgh International Festival by storm  Bright, breezy and pleasantly down to earth isn\u0026rsquot how you\u0026rsquod imagine a composer of left field music to be \u0026ndash this, after all, is the woman who wrote a concerto for beatboxer and orchestra, and another piece to be performed using \u0026ldquobody percussion by a flash mob at the M6 services.  But the description fits Anna Meredith perfectly. A 10-year veteran of commissions for the BBC Proms and a winner of the Scottish Album Of The Year for Varmints, her debut record, the Scot\u0026rsquos playful but intellectually rigorous compositions had already won her a legion of admirers before this year\u0026rsquos Edinburgh Festival.  After it, she was the name on everyone\u0026rsquos lips thanks to having had not one but three separate works performed in the capital, including an orchestrated  performance of Varmints as part of the uber-cool Light On The Shore series at the Leith Theatre.  27 Robbie Grfith  Freerunner, 17  Why? He delivers his parkour thrills Renton-style  \u0026ldquoChoose le. Choose a sport. Choose an interest. These were the words which kicked off a viral video, a parkour remake of the classic Trainspotting scene, in which Coatbridge-lad, Grfith flipped and hurtled across Edinburgh, until it concluded with the alternative line, \u0026ldquoChoose parkour.  The film, Grfith recalls, was triggered when his brother suggested that he should make a video to the Trainspotting track and his dad then suggested they should go one further and remake the scene. Grfith and a film-maker friend made it, uploaded it in March last year, and overnight became a sensation. Since then Grfith has travelled the world with parkour, competing, visiting friends, doing a six month tour of America with his sponsor, the Motus Projects, and yes making more videos.  26 Mhairi Black  SNP MP, 24  Why? She won\u0026rsquot be told, on anything  One of the coolest things about Mhairi Black is the way that three years at Westminster doesn\u0026rsquot seem to have changed her very much at all. Yes, she\u0026rsquos got a little older \u0026ndash she went in at just 20 years old \u0026ndash but she hasn\u0026rsquot got any quieter or less determined. When, as she has said, Alex Salmond suggested to her that she should have a bit of a makeover and some new clothes, she ignored the advice. When online haters took her to pieces she shrugged them off, and then fought back \u0026ndash with a powerful speech earlier this year describing some of the misogynistic and homophobic comments she received.  Mhairi Black is who she is \u0026ndash gay, smart, passionate, angry, socialist \u0026ndash and she\u0026rsquos not changing any of that for anyone. She even still maintains her disregard for the institution which she is part of and, just last month, reiterated her feelings. \u0026ldquoIt does not serve us, she said, \u0026ldquoand in actual fact I would go so far as to say it\u0026rsquos not even a parliament it\u0026rsquos a club that masquerades itself.  25 Katie Archibald  Cyclist, 24  Why? She\u0026rsquos got style and medals  Katie Archibald is nothing  not colourful. Her hair has been just about every hue under the sun. Her left arm is tattooed by drawings from The Thinker of Tender Thoughts by the poet Shel Silverstein. On her right are the Olympic rings. Her love of motorbikes saw her crash at 70mph on a Cheshire lane in the run up to the Rio Olympics.  But in between all this colour and extracurricular drama, there are the races and that really cool thing she does which is to win medals \u0026ndash three at this year\u0026rsquos Commonwealth Games and she has her eyes on three, too, at the next Olympics in Tokyo 2020.  24 Bigg Taj  Beatboxer, 35  Why? His mouth is a drum machine  As a kid Bigg Taj started doing beatbox long before he knew what those sounds he was making were. Then, he says, \u0026ldquowhen I heard guys like Killa Kela, Rahzel and Scratch, I realised what it is and decided to pursue it. It\u0026rsquos been my passion for well over a decade, creating music with my mouth and pushing the boundaries of my vocals.  Now Scotland\u0026rsquos premier beatboxer, Bigg Taj, a Sikh of Indian heritage, has performed with his idols, supporting Method Man and Redman. But Bigg Taj isn\u0026rsquot just about the performance \u0026ndash he also runs a Youtube channel with beatbox tutorials and has been doing youth work for years. The workshops, he says, are about the creative writing and beatboxing, but they\u0026rsquore also about giving young people a space to talk. Among these, he says, is one in Polmont prison with rap emcee Spee Six Nine.  23 Claire Cunningham  Dancer, 41  Why? She alters the way we look at bodies, able or disabled  Dancer and choreographer Claire Cunningham\u0026rsquos extraordinary shows have always challenged how people feel about disability. When she dances on crutches \u0026ndash which she has used to walk since the age of fourteen \u0026ndash they become marvellous, magical and sometimes humorous extensions of herself. Her shows ask big questions. Guide Gods, for instance, looked at religious attitudes towards the disabled. Give Me a Reason to Live was based on the depiction of disability in the work of the painter Hieronymus Bosch. It was, she said, a live memorial to the disabled victims of the Nazi euthanasia program.  Cunningham was born with osteoporosis and arthrogryposis, but didn\u0026rsquot view herself as disabled until she went to university. Only later, when she came in contact with the choreographer Jess Curtis, did she realise that she might be able to dance, and that she had her own very special set of tools, her crutches.  Her most recent work, The Way You Look  Tonight is a collaboration with Curtis.  22 Richard Madden  Actor, 32  Why? Two words. The Bodyguard.  Richard Madden, without a doubt, is having his own special cool moment right now. It\u0026rsquos happening for him. The Bodyguard, in which he stars as Sergeant David Budd, is, according to the BBC, their \u0026ldquodrama of the decade.  At the bookies, the odds on him being the next Bond just got slashed to 10/1. He\u0026rsquos having to worry about being objectied and being seen as a hunk.  You can\u0026rsquot open a newspaper without coming across some article about who he is dating \u0026ndash actor Ellie Bamber \u0026ndash or what his latest movements have been. But, one of the coolest things about the Renfrewshire born actor, whose biggest role, previous to this was Robb Stark in Game Of Thrones, is that he clearly acknowledges he hasn\u0026rsquot always been cool. In one interview he confessed that  he weren\u0026rsquot acting he\u0026rsquod be a \u0026ldquoshy, fat kid living in Scotland with no girlfriend.  21 Shirley Manson  Singer, 52  Why? She\u0026rsquos not going to be owned by anyone  \u0026ldquoI actually feel that this is the most glorious part of my career, Manson said earlier this year. And it is, on many levels \u0026ndash not just because her band, Garbage, have stuck together for over twenty years, but because she\u0026rsquos being more outspoken, almost, now more than ever and she is showing younger artists the way to go. She has spoken out on #MeToo.  Earlier this year she wrote a moving op-ed in the New York Times about her experience of self harm. \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know I was a cutter until the first time I chose to cut, she wrote. \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot even know it was a \u0026lsquothing.\u0026rsquo..  Last month she had a go at the mainstream music industry, calling it \u0026ldquoexploitative. Along with Chvrches frontwoman, Lauren Mayberry, she is set to deliver the keynote speech at the annual South by Southwest conference next year \u0026ndash and you can bet it will be fizzing with feminism.  But above all, it\u0026rsquos glorious because of the raw power she still has a performer. Garbage performed at the Barrowlands earlier this month, and Peter Ross, reviewing the gig for The Times observed, \u0026ldquoShe was amped, vamped, pumped veins made a river delta on her temples."},{"url":null,"title":"fife-beach-off-limits-after-sewage-leak","story":"  A pollution warning was issued for Leven Beach which urged people to also stay away from the River Leven.  There was a power outage at Levenmouth waste water treatment works on Thursday, which caused the sewage leak.  People have been advised not to swim or paddle at Leven Beach.

Perhaps it\u0026rsquos not entirely coincidental that Corrie\u0026rsquos theme is played on the trumpet, and the programme itself filled with the undead likes of Ken, Rita and Audrey \u0026ndash who only look alive thanks to their suspiciously buoyant barnets.  Yet, it\u0026rsquos not Corrie that has fulfilled the Biblical prophecy of eternal le. It was actually the soap\u0026rsquos ad break \u0026ndash with strong evidence for resurrection arriving in the unexpected form of Egon from the Ghostbusters punting credit cards. It\u0026rsquos odd Paul the Apostle failed to mention such specics.  If you haven\u0026rsquot seen it yet, this posthumous turn by the late, great actor Harold Ramis blasphemously condenses the classic 80s movie into a 30-second ode to Halax\u0026rsquos interest rates. Bill Murray is conspicuous by his absence \u0026ndash clearly thinking better of the whole queasy concept. He is, however, replaced by special effects jiggery pokery with some banker called \u0026ldquoGreg, a cuddly everyman who busts a few ghosts using the power of his flexible friend. \u0026lsquoBusters fans should note this is all strictly non-canon.  The grand irony is that Ramis did not even have the choice to appear alongside \u0026ldquoGreg killing the undead \u0026ndash by the virtue of being dead himself. If he\u0026rsquod ed as an actual ghost, perhaps biting Dan Ackroyd\u0026rsquos head off for selling him out, it may have injected some imagination into Halax\u0026rsquos morally bankrupt concept. The dead may be rising, but they are certainly not incorruptible.  Boo the Kehoe  NOT everyone thinks the new Ghostbusters ad campaign is deeply distasteful and indicative of a creatively barren culture gnawing at itself and choking on the vomit.  Catherine Kehoe, Halax\u0026rsquos managing director for brands and marketing, thinks bustin\u0026rsquo the deceased with a nuclear-powered laser gun creates wonderful synergy with the bank\u0026rsquos core brand values. Perhaps because no-one seems to have told her Ramis is dead.  \u0026ldquoAs a straightforward bank, we keep things simple, she enthused. \u0026ldquo seeing Greg show Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis just how easy it is for our current account customers to pay with Visa contactless. Doubt Ramis is much bothered, to be honest. I suspect Ackroyd will now have a bit of spare cash to spend, however. Kehoe\u0026rsquos nauseating quote could easily serve as a farewell-cruel-world note and even your children would understand why you did it.  The agency behind this unholy abomination, Adam\u0026ampEve/DBB, are not naive hucksters \u0026ndash having previously superimposed Halax\u0026rsquos rotund everyman Greg into The Wizard of Oz, Top Cat and other beloved pop culture creations which reside deep within the collective subconscious psyche.  Clearly, no cherished iconography is sacred when making cold corporate brands synonymous with warm childhood memories. Perhaps \u0026ldquoGreg will be dropped into Titanic next to sell travel insurance.  All is illusion  AT least it\u0026rsquos real Ghostbusters footage that Halax\u0026rsquos gormless patsy \u0026ldquoGreg now pollutes. Soon, such time-consuming CGI hoo-ha will seem very quaint indeed. In the very near future, not only Ramis but all dead actors will live forever in new movies. You might too \u0026ndash perhaps appearing in footage of an unsavoury event you have no memory of partaking in. That\u0026rsquos because you didn\u0026rsquot and it\u0026rsquos being used to blackmail you. Welcome to the terrying reality of \u0026ldquoDeepFakes.  In December last year, an anonymous internet user going by the name DeepFakes posted some realistic looking \u0026ldquoadult clips of famous folk on messageboard Reddit. He created these films utilising a sophisticated AI program to insert celebrities\u0026rsquo faces onto the bodies of pornographic film stars. One year on, this software is out there and anyone can use it \u0026ndash with the results growing more convincing by the day. Remember, Space Invaders was indistinguishable from magic just a few decades ago.  DeepFakes software essentially offers users the ability to convincingly swap one face for another in any image or video. Movies such as Gladiator \u0026ndash where Ollie Reed\u0026rsquos long-overdue death meant his head had to be superimposed digitally upon a body double \u0026ndash required skilled CGI experts spending months to get convincing results. A somewhat fitting final curtain call from Ollie, who spent most of his le off his head anyway.  Now though, even Ollie in his most inebriated state could manage to feed a selfie into an algorithm and produce a high quality face swap.\u0026nbspAnd since so many of us have our gurning coupons plastered over the internet, we can all expect to be starring in a movie of our own very soon \u0026ndash indistinguishable from reality and fresh for social embarrassment, bullying or blackmail.  Once you retreat from reality in shame, don\u0026rsquot worry \u0026ndash you\u0026rsquoll be able to entertain yourself by imposing your face onto Indiana Jones or Rocky movies. If this doesn\u0026rsquot appeal, you can always bring about WW3 by propagating some fake news. On the downside, Putin may soon release footage of a certain alleged hotel room encounter with a certain President, who will now be able to claim it\u0026rsquos a DeepFake. And in this world where no court of law can distinguish between real footage and digital fabrication, R Kelly will be a very happy man.  And finally...  DON\u0026rsquoT despair of a future where it\u0026rsquos impossible to distinguish illusion from reality \u0026ndash take heart in the fact the young Leia, Luke and Han will be reborn digitally in countless new Star Wars movies  to consume ravenously for thousands of years to come.  Ironically, geneticists will likely have created real Ewoks by then, and will perhaps be the only flesh and blood creatures left in this immortal franchise. Perhaps we\u0026rsquoll also once again get to fawn over the steely-eyed, chiselled beauty of the young Steven Seagal \u0026ndash getting back to kicking Russian gangster ass instead of just kissing it.  Buoyed by hopes of movie stardom, most young actors are currently signing away the rights to their image for the next million years like a Scientology contract.  Yet, they\u0026rsquore superfluous to requirements. All film studios need now is a selfie and an answerphone message. Troublesome and expensive flesh embodiment of talent will be disposed of. The profession of acting will have as much prospects as journalism in the forthcoming post-truth world, a cosy,familiar prison where we now have all the stars \u0026ndash and facts \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquoll ever need."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-admits-to-getting-irritated-by-leadership-talk","story":"  The Prime Minister insisted she was focused on the country\u0027s future rather than her own, in a BBC interview to mark the six-month countdown to Brexit.  Mrs May criticised Mr Johnson for using \"completely inappropriate\" language when he described her Brexit strategy as putting the UK in a \"suicide vest\".  Around 50 Brexiteers met to war-game ways to oust the PM last Tuesday evening and Mr Johnson is widely-expected to vie to replace Mrs May.  Asked  she would reassure the Conservative Party she was not determined to go on and on, the PM told BBC Panorama\u0027s Inside No 10: Deal or No Deal?: \"I get a little bit irritated but this debate is not about my future, this debate is about the future of the people of the UK and the future of the United Kingdom.  \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m focused on and that\u0027s what we should all be focused on.  \"It\u0027s ensuring that we get that good deal from the European Union which is good for people in the UK, wherever they live in the UK, that\u0027s what\u0027s important for us ... It\u0027s the future of people in the UK that matters.\"  Mr Johnson faced a Tory backlash after comparing Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan to a \"suicide vest\" and his former communications director, Guto Harri, said on Saturday that his ex-boss was \"digging his political grave\".  Mrs May said the former Foreign Secretary\u0027s comments were \"not right\".  She went on: \"I have to say that that choice of language is completely inappropriate.  \"I was Home Secretary for six years and, as Prime Minister for two years now using language like that was not right and it\u0027s not language I would have used.\"  The PM was once described as \"bloody dficult woman\" by former Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, and later claimed the description as a badge of honour.  She told the programme that person was \"still there\" but there was a \u0026ldquodference between those who think you can only be bloody dficult in public and those who think actually you bide your time, and you\u0027re bloody dficult when the time is right and when it really matters.\""},{"url":null,"title":"a-good-week-for-the-eu-with-its-stance-on-hungary","story":"  Prime Minister Victor Orb\u0026aacuten of the ruling Hungarian Fidesz party came to Strasbourg to debate the criticisms in a resolution drawn up by Dutch MEP and my group colleague Judith Sargentini. If anyone needs a refresher it is worth remembering this is a man who has called migrants poison, referred to \u0026lsquomuslim invaders\u0026rsquo and peddled anti-Semitic myths about George Soros. His government, democratically elected it has to be said, has forcibly retired judges, banned international NGOs from working in Hungary, built a fence to keep out refugees and lots more besides.  As one academic succinctly put it this week \u0026ldquothe EU is like a club with a strong bouncer, but little security once you\u0026rsquore inside the venue. The present Hungarian government has not been abiding by the values that make up the EU, and the EU, slowly, had got round to acting. The Parliament, for the first time ever, was to debate the triggering of Article 7 proceedings, effectively putting Hungary in a sin bin cutting funding, limiting voting rights and other measures until it plays by the rules.  On the day he simply fell back on tired rhetoric asserting that the report \u0026ldquoinsults the honour of the Hungarian nation whilst feeding a victim complex that the Parliament had already made up its mind. He fell back on anti-immigration rhetoric repeatedly talking about migrants whilst ignoring all other criticisms proudly proclaiming that \u0026ldquothe Hungarian people have decided not to be a nation of migrants.  Remember, Hungary signed up to the values of the EU when it joined and these values are part of the organisation. These include the rights of iniduals and the EU institutions must defend them where possible, particularly in the face of the threats we now face. Europe is a continent of migrants and  our history shows us anything it is that narrow minded anti-immigrant rhetoric always ends badly.  Unsurprisingly his speech fell flat. MEPs from the centre right EPP, the centre left S\u0026ampD, the liberal ALDE and Green groups all stood one by one to condemn his government\u0026rsquos actions and at the end of the day with 448 votes in favour the European Parliament voted to recommend the initiation of Article 7 proceedings. This is a real strong sign that EU values must be respected and could result in Hungary being stripped of its right to vote in the Council of the European Union.  The details of the resolution that we approved are grim reading. The Budgetary Control Committee recommends deduction of EU funding to Hungary over concerns that much of it ends up in the pockets of his cronies the Culture Committee condemns attacks on academic freedom the Constitutional Affairs Committee condemns infringement of judicial independence the Committee on Women\u0026rsquos Rights condemns reversals on gender equality.  This week\u0026rsquos debate got to the heart of what the EU is for. To what extent should the sovereign EU states be able to pick and choose from the common rules they all voluntarily signed up to? To what extent should the rest of us be able to call them on it? Can solidarity be imposed?  None of these have simple answer, and in the EU everything is connected to everything else, that\u0026rsquos the point. Recently, in Greece a profligate series of Greek governments tipped their economy into chaos, and it was only EU support that avoided a worse disaster. But could, should, the EU have been gentler with the Greek people themselves? I would say yes, but then, why should my taxpayers in Scotland pay for irresponsible profligacy at the other end of the continent?  Catalonia too has shown that the EU is ultimately a club of member states and there is work to do. There\u0026rsquos a democratic discussion that needs to be promoted between Barcelona and Madrid and the EU has not stepped up, though I hope it may yet. At least on Hungary, this week the Parliament has stood up for democracy and the rule of law.  However, in the face of this overwhelming display of what the EU can be, there were still 197 members of our European Parliament that opposed taking action against Mr Orb\u0026aacuten. My greatest shock comes not from UKIP and the Front National, you\u0026rsquod expect it of them, but from the UK Conservatives who were the only governing right-wing party to support him.  They voted to support the policies and the man, in the face of everything he stands for. My most charitable explanation is that this shows the chronic weakness of the UK post-Brexit as its government desperately cuddles up to anyone who might provide some help irrespective of morals or long-term strategic cost. At its worst this is a sign that the Conservative party is shting hard to the right and anything goes.  I think it is the latter and increasingly I do not think you can describe the Conservatives as a centre-right party. The clues are in the company they keep. It was because of an ill thought out commitment to appease the right in David Cameron\u0026rsquos 2005 leadership campaign that the party left the centre-right EPP group of the parliament and set up their own. Earlier this year they invited the anti-migrant Swedish-Democrats to join them. Yes, the party that was the focus of so much concern in last weekend\u0026rsquos Swedish election are happy members of the same Group as Mrs May\u0026rsquos Tories.  Unfortunately, the rhetoric of our Prime Ministers also fits with that of the hard right. David Cameron talked about \u0026ldquoswarms of migrants. In the debate this week Mr Bay of the French Front National said that \u0026ldquothe EU promotes multiculturalism, against out values. How is that so dferent from Mrs May\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquo you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere?  I fear for the Tories and for what they may turn into. I fear for what that means for the rest of us  we\u0026rsquore stuck in a brexit Britain run by them. Right now there is a fight going on in constituency branches across the UK. This is a fight for the soul of their party and I fear the old fashioned \u0026lsquosmall c\u0026rsquo liberal Conservatives are losing. There are still those fighting but they are increasingly cast out or in a minority. The MEPs Richard Ashworth and Julie Girling voted against Orb\u0026aacuten but they have already felt the need to leave the Conservative group in the Parliament. Only one actual Tory MEP voted against Orb\u0026aacuten and I want to end by praising Nosheena Mobarik, Conservative MEP for Scotland. She not only voted with us and her conscience, she defied what I\u0026rsquod guess was a pretty tough London imposed group whip as well. I hope her colleagues across the UK will look to her action, ask themselves some hard questions and set about challenging those who are changing the Tory party into something they find unthinkable. Their silent acquiescence has implications for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"birthday celebration for charity knitter iris","story":"        A Rothienorman woman who knits items for charity is preparing to celebrate her 98th birthday.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most erse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural signicance and interest.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspSunday 16 Sep 2018 1:38

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot...

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Sunday 16 Sep 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Sunday 16 Sep 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusSunday 16 Sep 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 16, 2018 at 1:00 pmAdvertorial: MacGregor Industrial Supplies open days. 27th \u0026#8211 28th September 2018 \u0026#8211 8am to 7pm, 29th September 2018  \u0026#8211 8am to 12noon.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously dficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800649.1537039818!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon i would spend my days hiding under the table reading","story":"        Nicola Sturgeon is in her Holyrood office, a Joan Eardley painting on the wall behind her and Paul Auster\u0026#8217s daunting slab of a novel 4 3 2 1 on her desk. Plucked from my own book shelves, it is part-prop, part-symbol of my inadequacy. Its pristine condition betrays that I have hardly opened it. For more than a year it has taunted me with its enormous bulk. A couple of times, I have lted it down with good intent, then replaced it, unable to commit to its 866 pages.                Sturgeon may have a country to run, but she has read it not only has she read it, but she can critique it, explaining the premise to me in detail and adding that, while she liked parts of it, she wouldn’t particularly recommend it.            Sturgeon is that rare thing: a politician who devours fiction. Novels, she says, provide both a shelter from political storms and a means of gaining a deeper  understanding of the human condition.              The First Minister is evangelical about her pastime. Many Saturday nights, she will tweet a picture of her latest literary dalliance, and once or twice a year, her recommendations from her summer/winter reading. Then, for a fleeting moment, Twitter becomes that little bit less toxic, as bibliophiles from across the political ide drop their sniping to chip in with their own opinions.Sturgeon has eclectic tastes. Her Christmas recommendations featured six crime novels, but also a dozen others including George Saunders’ Lincoln in the Bardo and Jenner Egan’s Manhattan Beach. The thread had 618 RTs and 2.8k likes, suggesting many people appreciate a First Minister with a hinterland.She is also rapidly becoming a regular at festivals. During the Edinburgh Book Festival, she interviewed Ali Smith. And on Friday she will be in conversation with author Damian Barr at a an event at the Wigtown Book Festival. As a kind of taster, Sturgeon has carved out half an hour to talk to me about the important role reading plays in her le. First and foremost, she says, books help her to relax. I am lucky enough to witness this first-hand. When I arrive, she is tense and aloof as you might expect of a leader going through the toughest period of her four-year tenure. But as she starts talking about reading, she smiles, all the formality melts away, and you can almost see her shrugging off the troubles of the day.            Sturgeon tells me she discovered the joys of reading early most of her childhood memories revolve around books and particularly Saturday morning trips to Irvine Library.  “There is something quite calming about being surrounded by shelves and shelves of books, so I liked the whole experience of being in a library. It probably is what really introduced me to the power of losing yourself in reading,” she says.“I remember at my fth birthday party, hiding under the table with a book, while everyone played games around me. I remember my mum sort of saying: ‘Would  you come out? We have people here’. But, you know,  it was up to me, I would spend still most of my days hiding under the table reading. I really haven’t changed.”Right now, no-one could blame Sturgeon for wanting to hide under a table. In the weeks  since the sex allegations against her friend and mentor Alex Salmond became public she has been under huge personal and political pressure in addition she is under fire over some of her education policies, in particular standardised testing for P1s. So is  reading helping her through these dficult days? “I have no idea what you mean,” she chuckles.             Joking aside, she says she reads consistently, a few pages every night before sleep claims her and most Saturday nights. “But I probably value reading more at times of stress because it takes your mind away from what you might be worrying about. I also find reading – even  you are reading about something not remotely connected to the issues you are dealing with – gives you a dferent perspective on things.”Her favourite book –  she had to choose one – is Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s Sunset Song, with its strong female protagonist Chris Guthrie. “Sunset Song opened my eyes to parts of the country I didn’t know and it has a very strong  female lead character, although it’s set around about the time of WWI,” she says.“I think that probably had an impact on my thinking around gender and feminism, although other writers such as Edna O’Brien and Alice Walker which I read in my mid- to late-teens also played a part.”Interestingly, all three of the non-fiction books she recommended at Christmas 2017 – Mary Beard’s Women and Power, Hillary Clinton’s What Happened and Coretta Scott King’s My Le, My Love, My Legacy – have feminist undercurrents. “I  don’t read a lot of non-fiction,” Sturgeon says. “I have enough non-fiction to keep me occupied, but when I do, it’s likely to be stuff I can take something from. The Hillary Clinton book, for example: whatever you think of her politics, her sheer resilience as a woman I find really inspiring. And that book, although chunks of it were the sort of clichéd stuff that [her books] have been full of in the past, a lot of it was quite raw and authentic.”Perhaps Sturgeon is more drawn to fiction because it has the power to stimulate the imagination. The playwright Jo Clford once said: “Empathy is a muscle and theatre is the gym.”  But empathy is a quality much lacking in politics today. Could novel-reading provide a similar workout? And,  so, has it made the First Minister a better, more-compassionate leader? “It’s not for me to comment on my abilities as a politician,” she says. “But there’s no doubt it develops an empathy and understanding of people, circumstances, parts of the world periods in history,” she says. “It changes and broadens [your] perspective.”            Barr – author of Maggie and Me, a memoir about surviving Thatcher’s Britain – plans to introduce the Wigtown event by talking about other leaders’ reading preferences. When asked about his favourite book, Donald J Trump put The Art of the Deal by Donald J Trump second only to the Bible Theresa May said Pride and Prejudice . Jeremy Corbyn claims to have read Ulysses four times, though his favourite novelist is the Nigerian Chinua Achebe.Surely the world would be a better place  all politicians were required to consume more fiction? “Undoubtedly,” answers Sturgeon. “With the best will in the world nobody experiences everything and you are dealing all the time with issues that you don’t have first-hand experience of. I’m not saying reading books are a substitute for that, but they definitely allow you to understand people and situations that otherwise you might not understand.”Such is Sturgeon’s desire to pass on the pleasure of books, she started the First Minister’s Reading Challenge which has been running in primary schools since 2016 and was recently extended to secondary schools. The day before we speak, she has been visiting Renfrew High to see the work done by pupils who have produced a graphic novel.“It’s all about trying not to come at it as: ‘You must read because it helps you do well at school,’ although it does, but instead trying to encourage kids to have a love of reading for its own sake.”The book festival appearances are about supporting authors who may struggle to make a living. “I think that one of the most special, wonderful things that anyone can ever do is to write a novel that gets published and then provides enjoyment for other people. “That is also why I tweet about them. If I have got huge enjoyment reading a book, then a tiny wee thing I can do is to recommend that book and hopefully someone else will pick it up and read it.”Under-read and often corralled into genres such as crime or memoirs, female writers are often in particular need of promotion. Sturgeon says she naturally gravitates towards books written by women. “I don’t set targets,” she says, “but I think I probably do subconsciously keep a track of the breadth both in terms of gender and kind of international reach of the books I am reading.”“I think women writers are read less and reviewed a lot more harshly than men are, so I like trying to do my little bit to redress that balance.”With as-yet unread books piled high at home, and literary festivals flourishing across the country, Sturgeon guffaws at Will Self’s proclamation that the novel is dead. “I think Will Self supported independence so he is clearly right on lots of things, but on this he is just wrong,” she says. “I think the novel will outlive all of us and generations to come.”Barr is the patron of Gladstone’s Library in Hawarden in Wales. He tells me William Gladstone read a book a day covering all sorts of genres and had “lively” opinions on most of them. Then, at the age of 85, the former Liberal prime minister took his 32,000-strong book collection a quarter of a mile in a wheelbarrow to the then library building.A vocal No voter last time round  Barr says he is nevertheless proud to hail from a country where the First Minister tweets photographs of books on the Man Booker Prize long-list. “It’s unusual in the current age to find the leader of a country who is really public about and vocal about their love for books and not just generic way, but in a really specic way,” he says. “We need politicians doing more deep thinking and more deep reading, rather than just reading 140 characters in a Tweet.”The power of books to bring people together was brought home to Barr when he attended the Scribes at the Rock Festival on the Falls Road last month. “There was I standing right in front of Gerry Adams reading from [Maggie and Me] which opens with the Brighton bombing and afterwards he came up and shook my hand. He read the book and tweeted me to say how much he loved it, which was amazing.“I think  books can do that in Northern Ireland, they can do it anywhere.”Back in the First Minister’s office, my allotted half-hour is drawing to a close, but Sturgeon seems in no hurry. She is still talking animatedly about Ali Smith’s Autumn: “It captures the confusion and ision and feeling in that immediate post-Brexit period in a better way than anything else fiction or non-fiction I have read since.” And about Muriel Spark whose novels she has been re-reading in her centenary year – “I had forgotten just how sublime they are.”As I switch my tape recorder off, she strides across the room to her bookshelves and pulls out a handful of slim volumes. “Have you heard of Charco Press?” she asks. “It’s a new publishing house in Edinburgh which specialises in translated fiction from Latin America”. It occurs to me, then, that for a politician who is sometimes accused of trying to push Scots literature and language on to the curriculum, her tastes are anything but parochial.  We part having swapped recommendations. She convinces me to read The Mars Room - a Man Booker prize long-listed novel by Rachel Kushner about a woman serving le in a US jail for murdering a stalker. I hope I convince her to read Goblin by Ever Dundas. “I could go on talking about books as long as you let me,” she says as I gather up my things. And I really do believe her.A Le in Books – a conversation between Nicola Sturgeon and Damian Barr – will take place at the Wigtown Book Festival at 3:30pm on Friday.         \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

for consultation in November.\n\"However, there are a limited number of new site allocations that we consider are appropriate to include in the next Local Development Plan and we would like feedback

allocation for the Landmark Forest Park is being considered as is a small extension to the allocation at the Grantown Caravan Park.\n\"The consultation we are carrying out from this week to September 21 concerns these site allocations only and no unrelated comments can be considered at this stage.\"\nThe small industrial zone extension is proposed to the north of the Dalfaber Industrial Estate and there are proposals to designate more land for economic use at Granish just north of the village.\nLand for industrial use has been regarded as being in short supply within the Aviemore area for many years.\nThe park authority is also looking to re-allocate the existing protected open space at Spaven Drive at the north end of Aviemore for community use.\nThe site has been identied by Aviemore Community Enterprise Company as a possible location for a new community hall with a kick park and playground.\nThe blueprint for the Landmark attraction is to expand the site to the west and south which would accommodate increased parking and future expansion of the business.\nLand to the north-east of Grantown\u0027s caravan park has been pinpointed for possible development.\nThe CNPA is required to publish a LDP for the park which must be reviewed every five years.\nBetween November 2017 and March this year the MIR \u0026ndash which outlined the CNPA\u0027s views on the key issues

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment ing from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise.

But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.\nHer government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.\nShe had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.\nBut despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.\nInstead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.\nFaced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.\nIt also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls?\nAnd while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.\nThe aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.\nHer government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.\nThis reliance on the DUP remains the central problem and  any process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.\nThe Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.\nThe Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit.

It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter.

is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread  AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my we and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data           \u0027                 .                                \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland  to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountul fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautul, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these dferent organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the dference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit mps call for action to help northern ireland fishing fleet","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We heard pleas for increased quota and action to alleviate crewing shortages in the Northern Ireland fleet.\n\n\"The Government\u0027s fisheries white paper is a step in the right direction, but more detail is needed on how quota allocations will change. \n\n\"The industry also needs to be reassured that the Government will be ready to support them in the unlikely and undesirable event of no deal.\n\n\"The Government must now take action on Ireland\u0027s unilateral suspension of the Voisinage Arrangement and on the long-running dispute over Lough Foyle.\"\n\nThe Voisinage Arrangement allows for mutual access to Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland vessels up to six nautical miles off the coast of each country.\n\nSince Brexit there has been considerable debate between politicians on both sides of the border over who should have the right to use Lough Foyle.\n\nDr Murrison continued: \"We found an industry in Northern Ireland with great people and huge potential, but it is fragile.\n\n\"Changes to quotas and access to waters aren\u0027t enough. We must develop infrastructure to support the Northern Ireland fishing fleet, find crews for boats and enable fishing businesses to sell into Europe post Brexit.\"\n\nThe report\u0027s findings were welcomed by Alan McCulla, chief executive officer of Kilkeel-based fisherman\u0027s co-operative Sea Source Ltd and the Anglo North Ireland Food Producer\u0027s Organisation.\n\n\"It\u0027s very encouraging to see MPs very engaged and having a genuine interest in the fishing industry,\" he told the Belfast . \n\n\"Fishing is one of the few industries that has the very real potential for a tremendous idend from Brexit. We\u0027re especially pleased to see there has been a call for access to properly qualied and experienced crew.\n\n\"We\u0027ve seen an escalation in the \u0027scallop wars\u0027 between the UK and France recently, but it also has to be recognised that Dublin has been excluding Northern Ireland fishermen. The Voisinage Arrangement has been suspended in Ireland since 2016 and we need Dublin to engage on this issue and end the impasse.\n\n\"Then we need to look at infrastructure in the industry in Northern Ireland. Given the current political situation, we\u0027ve had no one here making decisions for the past 18 months at a time when major decisions need to be made. \n\n\"Brexit will happen, but there\u0027s no way we will be able to maximise the potential benefits it will bring unless we act now.\n\n\"It\u0027s ironic that the Republic of Ireland has been investing heavily in port infrastructure when they could be the losers. In Northern Ireland we are behind the game and I\u0027d encourage London to progress urgently.\"\n\nFor Mr McCulla, the only disappointment in the report is the failure to mention the Hague Preference, a mechanism designed to adjust national fish quota allocations to take account of the needs of certain fisheries-dependent areas in northern parts of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\"The existence of it was a main reason why we saw 92% of the Northern Ireland fishing industry vote to leave the EU.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed  the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105  the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause signicant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and dfered substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37321165.ece/60b27/AUTOCROP/w620h342/_1109ks18_141.jpg","title":"bomb alert at sinn fein mlas office second alert ongoing in

One was at Connolly House, the Andersonstown Road office of Alex Maskey, and the other in the Poleglass area. \n\nGraffiti stating \"RIP Maskey\" was daubed in the Poleglass area along with \"Join ANP\".\n\nPolice are not treating the incidents as linked. \n\nPolice cordoned off an area around Connolly House after receiving a report at around 10pm of a device being left in the area. They conducted searches of the streets in the area. The security cordon remained in place into Sunday while police carried out their investigation.\n\nThe device at the Andersonstown Road office was declared an elaborate hoax. \n\nThe police warning for the public to be vigilant and to not touch anything in the Poleglass/Pantridge Road area remains in place. Police said they are working to establish the location of the item following the report at 6pm on Saturday.\n\nStephen Magennis appealed to anyone who knew of the location of any device to provide more details. \n\nHe said: \"I don\u0027t want the community in danger as the Pantridge Road is a long road and would need to know exactly where to go. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Maskey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am appealing to the people who came forward and claimed there was a device in that area to come forward again with an exact location. I don\u0027t care how you get the message to me it is important this community is not at risk. All I want it this dealt with safely.\"\n\nPolice have appealed for information.\n\n“As we work to keep people safe, I would re-emphasise to the local community and people travelling through it that they should be mindful of their own personal safety. If anyone comes across anything suspicious, they should contact police immediately on 101,” Chief Inspector Gavin Kirkpatrick.\n\nIn August the Connolly House offices were target in an arson attack and paint was also thrown over the front of the building.\n\nAt the time MP Paul Maskey described it as an \"attack on democracy\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes,  a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond.

May’s Brexit plan is the “right one for now” and could be altered by a future prime minster, Michael Gove has said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe Environment Secretary admitted the Chequers proposals had forced him to compromise on some of his beliefs, but insisted the most important issue now was ensuring Britain leaves the European Union in “good order”.\n\nMrs May’s Brexit blueprint sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, and has infuriated hardline Brexiteers.\n\n\n“A future PM could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the EU,” says \n@michaelgove\n “but the Chequers approach is the right one for now.” \n#marr\n \npic.twitter/yEAIyQXkLo\n\n— BBC Politics  \nSeptember 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAsked  the plan would be permanent, Mr Gove told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Yes, but there’s one critical thing, a future prime minister could always choose to alter the relationship between Britain and the European Union.\n\n“But the Chequers approach is the right one for now because we have got to make sure that we respect that vote and take advantage of the opportunities of being outside the European Union.”\n\n\n\"To have a second referendum would be to throw this government a leline\" says Shadow International Trade Secretary \n@BarryGardiner\n \n#Ridge\n \npic.twitter/Wd33b0wgUe\n\n— Ridge on Sunday  \nSeptember 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMr Gove said the responsibility was now on the European Union to compromise “because we’ve shown flexibility”.\n\n“I’ve compromised,” he added. “I’ve been quite clear that some of the things that I argued for in the referendum passionately, as a result of Chequers I have to qualy one or two of my views.\n\n“I have to acknowledge the parliamentary arithmetic.\n\n“I believe the critical thing is making sure we leave in good order with a deal which safeguards the referendum mandate.”\n\nLabour’s London mayor Sadiq Khan has called for voters to have the final say on what happens next.\n\nIn an article for the Observer, he wrote: “This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the Government, or a vote on a no-deal Brexit  one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSadiq Khan called for a fresh referendum \n\n\n\n\nBut shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said a fresh referendum would give Mrs May a leline.\n\nHe told Ridge On Sunday: “Calling for a second referendum is really giving her a leline because then she can say ‘Oh,  I can’t get it through Parliament I’ll go back to the people’.”\n\nLiam Fox said Brussels has made “reassuring noises” in recent weeks in the Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe International Trade Secretary previously put the chances of a deal at 60-40.\n\nAsked about the assessment, he told Ridge: “Over the last few weeks we have certainly heard more reassuring noises from the European Commission and some of our European partners.\n\n“They have understood that Britain is serious that  we don’t get a good deal we could end up with no deal.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"education secretary urged to respect holyrood vote

It was a sad day for us inidually, employees at Lehman had close bonds.”\n\nThe failure of the US banking giant became one of the most infamous and shocking moments of the crisis, spiralling the credit crunch into full-blown market chaos.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"theres a lot of road ahead as lib dem leader says sir vince cable","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I have a series of tasks to do. I’m going to do them. I’m not setting a time horizon. I think it would be foolish to do so with so much uncertainty flying around.”\n\nPressed on being at the helm at the time of the next slated general election in 2022, he said: “2022 is a long time off, I think it’s improbable, actually, that I will be leading us then.”\n\nLord Campbell told the Daily Mirror: “You know when you’ve run out of road. I think he can see the end of the road.\n\n“He’s given it his best shot.

State television broadcaster CGTN reported that surging waves flooded a seaside hotel in the city of Shenzhen.\n\nThe national meteorological center said southern China “will face a severe test caused by wind and rain” and urged officials to prepare for possible disasters.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the typhoon featured sustained winds of 96 miles per hour and gusts of up to 118 mph. \n\nThe Hong Kong Observatory said although Mangkhut had weakened slightly, its extensive, intense rainbands were bringing heavy downfall and frequent squalls.\n\nHundreds of flights were cancelled. All high-speed and some normal rail services in Guangdong and Hainan provinces were also halted on Sunday, the China Railway Guangzhou Group Co said.\n\nIn Fujian province and elsewhere, tens of thousands of fishing boats ed to port and construction work came to a stop.\n\n\nSuper Typhoon \n#Mangkhut\n is still barreling toward the northern \n#Philippines\n, packing sustained winds of 167 mph .

5000 neo natal unit help talented tattoo","story":"\nA Derry couple have raised over £5,000 in aid of the hospital unit that saved their twins’ lives with the help of a close friend.\n\nBob and Michelle McLaughlin daughters Saorlaith and Saoirse received le-saving care at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit , where they were looked after in 2016 after they were born prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication.\n\nThe girls arrived six weeks early and suffered from ‘Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome’ in the womb, where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.\n\nThey were nursed back to health by the staff at the Neo Natal unit and their parents have held a charity walk for the past two years to raise money to say thanks.\n\nThis year family friend Michael Kelly offered to hold a fundraising event at his tattoo parlour to help boost their donation.\n\nIt soon mushroomed into a huge family fun day at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park and rock night at the Delacroix which both took place on Saturday.\n\nMr Kelly was joined by a team of tattooist from across the north who managed to ‘ink up’ 120 people with specially designed tattoos.\n\nThose who got tattooed included parents whose children had spent time in the ward and even three members of staff.\n\nMr McLaughlin got two designs himself- a purple ribbon, which is the symbol of prematurity awareness, and a set of footprints surrounded by a heart shaped stethoscope to pay tribute to the care given to his daughters at the hospital.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping

couldn’t even have imagined that so many people would turn up and show their support from all over the city and beyond.\n\n“A lot of people had personal reasons for being there and personal reasons behind the tattoos that they choose.\n\n“There was one woman who got a tattoo in memory of her grand child who had sadly passed away in the NNICU, so there were a lot of really emotional stories.”\n\nAwareness\n\nMr McLaughlin thanked everyone who helped make the fundraising event such a huge success.\n\n“It means the world to us that Michael decided to do this for our family and that he and all his staff and visiting tattoo artists gave up their time for free,” he added.\n\n“It is something we will never forget. It has raised £5,347.20 for the NNICU and it has raised so much awareness as well.\n\n“Thank you also to The McConomy School of Irish dance who allowed their premises to be used for the fun day and to the dancers and bands that performed during the day, to Donna Kelly and Noleen O’Hara who baked all night for the bake sale, to the bikers and bands who took part in the Delacroix and everyone who

premises.\n\nThe application came before the September meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee seeking approval for the installation of three external retractable awnings to part of the front façade of the Custom House building at Custom House Street in Derry, pictured above.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, a planning officer said that advice had been received from the Historic Environment Division  that the installation would have an ‘adverse affect’ on a number of listed buildings within the area, including Custom House, the Harbour Commissioners Office, Harbour Square and The Guildhall.\n\nThe meeting was told that the HED were of the opinion that the proposal would result in ‘unnecessary damage’ to the historic structure. \n\nThe officer added that while the plans before them had been amended from a previous application, the awnings would still ‘obscure the windows to a certain extent and remain inappropriate on a building of this style and character’.\n\nThe meeting head that a precedent had been set by the nearby Guildhall Taphouse bar, formerly the Monico Bar, another listed building which mow has an awning over a seated area.\n\nHowever, the Historic Environment Division said the building was ‘of a dferent style’.\n\nThe planning officer advised local councillors refuse the application on grounds that the proposal is ‘unacceptable’ as it would have an adverse effect on the character of Custom House and the setting of the surrounding listed buildings.\n\nThe meeting then heard from a representative of the applicant, Kular Fashions, who said that the contractor chosen to carry out the work are the ‘best in the UK’ and would carry out the work in a ‘delicate’ manner which would have ‘no impact on the structure itself’.\n\nHe added that the awning would bring ‘le and people’ into the space and said buildings are ‘not antiques’ and should be ‘inhabitable’ whether it is sunny or raining.\n\n\n\n

 .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe applicant also assured councillors that the awning would not contain any advertising.\n\nDUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said there are a ‘strong trio’ of buildings in the area and she didn’t want to interfere with their architectural integrity.\n\nCouncillor Dan Kelly, of Sinn Féin, said the awnings would provide shelter for street entertainment and believed that tables on the streets was part of the ‘direction of travel’ in the city. \n\nHead of Planning with council, Maura Fox, said it is a ‘balancing act’ and she was ‘very much in favour of retaining listed buildings’. \n\nSDLP councillor Tina Gardiner said she would be supportive of the awning  it was ‘tasteful’ and made reference to their widespread use on historic buildings in London. \n\nUsing the Guildhall Taphouse as an example, she said it made the space visible and attracts ‘le and vitality’.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin Cllr Patricia Logue said, the buildings may become ‘vacant and derelict’, but agreed that they should contain ‘no advertising’. \n\nHowever, the SDLP’s Gus Hastings believed awnings didn’t serve much purpose and would only encourage ‘outside smoking’ and therefore wouldn’t be supporting it.\n\nEleven councillors voted in favour of the awnings and two against, meaning the advice of planning officers was ‘overturned’.\n\nThe meeting was told that the matter would come back before the council next month.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"voice people north needs heard european parliament post

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily.

Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg. The six semi-finals will be played over the weekend of September 28-30.\n\nMeanwhile, Portaferry and Ballygalget lock horns on Saturday in a bid to join Ballycran in the Senior Hurling Championship decider.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick. Devlin and Marty Robinson swapped scores, but it was Downpatrick who took an unlikely lead when Garrett Trainor, who was proving to be an effective target man at full forward when the ball did get into him, plucked the ball out of the air, turned and pointed the Hoops into a 0-3 to 0-2 lead after 14 minutes.\n\nAlas, this was to be their last score of the half as Kilcoo brought their A game to the party.\n\nUnanswered points from Doherty and Paul Devlin  eased the Magpies into a 0-6 to 0-3 lead by the break.\n\nConor McGrady and Doherty exchanged points at the start of the second half before Doherty swooped to send Kilcoo into a 1-7 to 0-4 lead with a clinical strike that caught Downpatrick flat-footed.\n\nMagee and Doherty swapped points before the former left five points in it with another converted free, but Kilcoo were lying in wait and with 42 minutes gone Ryan Johnston finished a mesmeric run with an explosive finish to put his side 2-8 to 0-6 clear.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nKilcoo were now in the zone and points from Jerome Johnston, Paul Devlin , Marty Devlin and Doherty put the issue beyond Downpatrick, 2-14 to 0-6.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Hoops, to their credit, never gave up and points from Owen McEvoy, Magee  and Rory Quinn put a bit of respectability on the final score.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nKilcoo: N Kane, Patrick Devlin, Aidan Branagan, N Branagan, M Rooney, D Branagan, Aaron Branagan, J McClean, Paul Devlin , Cillian Laverty, C Doherty , J Johnston , M Devlin , J J McLaughlin, Conor Laverty.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

Arlene Foster\u0026#8217s former adviser claims proves he did not try to delay RHI cost controls actually was an attempt to make changes which would have continued vastly lucrative subsides, the RHI Inquiry has been told.\n\n                \nReturning to the public inquiry for a sixth and final day of questioning, Andrew Crawford – the man who was at Arlene Foster’s side for almost all of her ministerial career – faced an intensely forensic examination of his conduct.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nYesterday the inquiry focussed on the DUP man’s deep and extensive contacts with Northern Ireland’s monopoly poultry processor, Moy Park – including the fact that three of his close family members who sell to Moy Park have between them 11 boilers.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDr Crawford admitted that by mid-2015 “I knew there was nothing to stop people running boilers 24/7 and getting paid for it...I could see how people could do that”.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHowever, he said he had “no knowledge” of actual abuse happening.\n\nDr Crawford has denied the allegation of fellow former DUP Spad Tim Cairns that he acted in the background to delay cost controls in the summer of 2015, at a point when the scheme was already known to be beyond its budget.\n\nCentral to Dr Crawford’s defence is an email which he sent to Mr Cairns on July 31.\n\nIt began: “I think that you will have to make changes from the 1st October as the system at the moment has no upper limit to the amount of support.” \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, the inquiry has revealed how the proposal which Dr Crawford then went on to make in that email as to what should happen on October 1 would have meant that many of the heaviest RHI users would have barely,  at all, worse off even after the scheme was changed in the way he suggested.\n\nThe inquiry’s technical assessor, energy expert Dr Keith MacLean, put it to Dr Crawford that his proposal to allow RHI boiler owners to double the size of boilers eligible for the most lucrative tarf under the proposed cost controls, and then to increase the number of hours which they could claim that top rate from 1,314 hours to 3,000 hours, meant that his proposal would not have reined in the out of control scheme.\n\nHe said: “On the basis of fairly simple arithmetic, it seems that what you’re proposing is actually a way of maintaining exactly the same income for the poultry industry that they were having before because what you’re saying is that currently there are 99kw boilers that they’re running for 6,000 hours but under the new regime, because the band is being doubled up to 199kw, they would then run for half the hours.”\n\nHe said the proposal would mean that they “would therefore maintain exactly the high income that was driving the behaviour that you have described that allows them to heat houses when they’re empty. Was that your conscious motivation for putting forward that?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe DUP man said that he was not saying that his proposal was “sound”, based on what he now knows, but that “there was a clear rationale” for it.\n\nHe said that he met boiler installer David Robinson in a chance encounter on the farm of his brother who was installing boilers, and was told that an average poultry house requires 16 hours of heat a day and that he had based his calculations on that number.\n\nHe said that he believed his proposal would “stop the rush of people coming in before the changes were taking place”.\n\nDr MacLean said: “Of course you would –  you give them just as much money as before.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “What you would be doing is stopping people then running the boilers 24/7.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt that point, inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin intervened. He said: “What this is is a sales pitch for Moy Park.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “No, it’s not. I don’t believe so.”\n\nSir Patrick cut him off, saying: “Hold on. Let’s read it: ‘If a Moy Park producer puts in a 199kw boiler, he can expect to run it for 3,000 hours’.”\n\nThe retired judge went on: “We’ve already got the warning before that some people are running boilers [in] empty sheds for 6,000 hours.\n\n“But this is for Moy Park – not for that [abuse]. ‘From these calculations you will see that Moy Park producers will be in a rush to refit their houses. If you increase the step from 1,314 to 3,000...’ Why 3,000? Because 3,000 is what Moy Park need. Now, unless you have, Dr Crawford, a really helpful reasoned explanation, that is what you have put in English in your email.”\n\nDr Crawford replied: “In terms of what [was in the email], it’s not my knowledge at that time [was that] it took the 3,000 hours to heat a house – not to heat it when it’s empty it’s to heat it when there’s a crop in the house.”\n\nWith obvious exasperation, Sir Patrick interjected: “Exactly. But that’s what Moy Park need or want or told you.”\n\nDr Crawford said that the previous night he got an email which talked about poultry having the highest heat need and he recalled the conversation with the boiler installer.\n\nSir Patrick put it to him: “You’re the man who originally recommended setting up a meeting with Moy Park you’re the man with the relations, all of whom worked for Moy Park in this email of yours Moy Park are the only people who are identied as requiring 3,000 hours. \n\n“Now, it’s a simple proposition: What you’re saying in this is...we have to stick by 1st October...there is nothing in there that doesn’t refer to the 3,000 hours being attributable to Moy Park’s needs.”\n\nThe DUP man said: “I believe  I had spoken to Moy Park, I would probably have came [sic] back with a figure that was below that...it goes back to: What is possible to get this through the [Assembly] committee?”\n\nSir Patrick said that the ministerial submission passed to him talked about putting in a limit of 1,314 hours, the same as in GB. He said: “What you’re saying here is: There is a special interest here, and that is the poultry interest, and Moy Park need 3,000 hours.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “What I was doing was putting a proposal on the table – or not even a proposal, a suggestion on the table – to try and allay Timothy Cairns’s concerns so that he could get the submission through.”\n\nSir Patrick asked: “Or for the benefit of the industry?” \n\nDr Crawford said: “Well, it’s what was the art of the possible...”\n\nDr MacLean said the panel was not disagreeing with him that his proposal would have made it much easier to get acceptance of the cost controls “because a big group that would object and would lobby MLAs would be perfectly happy with it” and there would be no spike in applications because “by giving them all the extra money and keeping the level of the money as it was before there would be no reason to rush to get into it”.\n\nDr Crawford then argued that his proposal would have stopped the extreme abuse of the scheme because those running boilers around the clock would no longer have an incentive to do so.\n\nSir Patrick said: “All right. Why not go for the limit suggested [from GB]?” The DUP man replied: “Because it goes back to the first two points that Dr Maclean was making...”\n\nWith an exasperated laugh, Sir Patrick interjected: “Because you wanted to sell it to the poultry...”\n\nDr Crawford said: “No, no. I didn’t want to sell it to the poultry industry. I wanted to make sure it could be delivered through the committee.”\n\nIn January 2017, internal Moy Park emails show that the company was tipped off by Andrew Crawford that RHI was to be shut – prompting the company to rush to install as many boilers as possible, and giving it a head-start on rivals.\n\nWhen asked about the meeting where he alerted the company to the looming change, Dr Crawford was vague, saying he did not clearly recall what had happened and suggested it may have been a passing reference to coming changes.\n\nThe meeting occured just after he became Spad to the then-finance minister Mervyn Storey, but the meeting was not in the ministerial diary and there are no minutes.\n\nSubsequently, senior Moy Park figures internally discussed how to rush through as many applications as possible how they could look at “any influence we can exert” to “soften” the proposed closure. One suggested they should “go up and see Dr Crawford”.\n\nInquiry counsel Joseph Aiken asked yesterday: “Did they come and see you?” Dr Crawford said: “I don’t recall”\n\nHe said he could not be sure and added: “I would have met Mike Mullen and other people from Moy Park on a frequent on a fairly regular basis.”\n\nAround that time, Dr Crawford and Moy Park again feature in the story.\n\nThe DUP man admitted that he deliberately removed from a crucial document which went to Executive ministers a reference to the fact that the poultry industry had driven the spike in RHI applications.\n\nThe submission was part of the Executive’s urgent procedure to close the scheme completely in February 2016 and Dr Crawford’s actions meant that the information going to other ministers was incomplete.\n\nWhen asked why he took it out, Dr Crawford admitted that the information “is accurate” but said it “wasn’t solely the poultry industry” responsible for the spike.\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin asked Dr Crawford to “think carefully... about any inference that the panel should draw in relation to your removal of this entry, given your family circumstances and your frequent talks to Mr Mark of Moy Park”.\n\nDr Crawford disputed that he had “frequent” talks with Mr Mark and said “it is not in relation to any inference in relation to my family”, adding that as a former DETI Spad he had a role in encouraging Moy Park’s growth.\n\nHe went on to say that “singling out Moy Park”, before correcting himself to say “the poultry industry, sorry”, was something that was “unfair”.\n\nSir Patrick said it was “undoubtedly true” that Moy Park had a key role in the spike and asked: “Why remove a true fact?”\n\nDr Crawford said “it was the inference that was being created at that time”.\n\nSir Patrick said: “It’s not an inference. That’s what I’m trying to get at with you. The major responsibility for the spike was the poultry industry, and Moy Park in particular. If that was true – and it was – why remove something that was true?”\n\nDr Crawford said: “My concern was the narrative that it was creating.”\n\nUnder intense questioning about his actions and motives, Sir Patrick eventually said: “All I’m trying to do, Dr Crawford, is trying to give you the fullest opportunity to explain something that I think you are unable to explain otherwise.”\n\nDr Crawford said he had “concern about the wider implications for the sector – the sector that employed a large number of people in Northern Ireland” – but insisted there was “no malice” in what he did.\n\nDr MacLean highlighted that it contradicted an earlier warning from Dr Crawford that a “tsunami” of applications was going to come because of Moy Park.\n\n\u0026gt\u0026gt\u0026gt Andrew Crawford is a crucial witness and over the course of six days, he faced rigorous questioning – made more rigorous because he repeatedly said “I cannot recall”, “I’m at a loss to know how that conversation went”, “I don’t know”, “I can’t say” and similar phrases, writes Sam McBride\n\nThe DUP man was unable to explain his role in many key developments in which he was, or is alleged to have been, involved.\n\nAs well as Dr Crawford’s signicance to the inquiry’s search for the truth about what happened with RHI, there is also a political signicance to what has emerged about how he acted.\n\nArlene Foster appointed Dr Crawford to a role where he had delegated authority, acting on behalf of the minister, and therefore she is accountable for his conduct.\n\nHis fate will impact on her own.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n
