Williamson must resign and Boris Johnson must return to deal with this crisis.\u0027 Yesterday exams regulator Ofqual said its algorithm used in A-levels and GCSEs was not used for the majority of vocational and technical qualifications (VTQ) - including BTECs.But in a statement tonight, England\u0027s exams watchdog said some exam boards, including OCR and Pearson, will \u0027need more time\u0027 to recalculate results.It said: \u0027OCR have said that their Cambridge National results will issue next week.\u0027Pearson, which initially did not think there would need to be significant changes made, has now decided to revise its arrangements to ensure that students\u0027 qualification-level results better reflect the unit-level results that students have already secured through internally assessed units.\u0027Ofqual added: \u0027Everyone is working as quickly as possible to confirm results as soon as possible, recognising the impact that delays are having on schools, colleges and students. No learner\u0027s result will go down as a consequence of regrading.\u0027Yesterday, Mr Hughes said: \u0027The timing is worrying, because thousands of students were due to get their results in the morning and others have already got results which we know will not go down, but which might improve.\u0027So it is vital for students that this is sorted in days rather than weeks so that students have the chance to celebrate and to plan their next steps. It is a stressful time and this delay will extend the uncertainties.\u0027 He added: \u0027Those students wanting to move onto further or higher education will be most worried about losing out on places.\u0027We are in close communication with DfE, Ofqual and Pearson to particularly make sure that BTEC students applying for universities can still be treated fairly.\u0027Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said: \u0027This late notification will cause very significant challenges for schools, trusts and colleges.\u0027It simply is unacceptable that some of the most disadvantaged students will not receive their grades tomorrow and that nothing has been done to correct this over the past few days.\u0027Dr Greg Walker, chief executive at the MillionPlus group of universities said: \u0027We must ensure that other learners and applicants are not forgotten. \u0027These include BTEC and other applied generals students whose grades may now be delayed for a significant period to rightly ensure they will be on a par with A-level candidates.\u0027Both the Government and universities should ensure that these applicants don\u0027t get squeezed out in these unprecedented circumstances.\u0027 The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union (UCU) have also voiced concerns. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \u0027Our priority is to ensure all students are treated fairly, including those who received vocational and technical results last week, such as BTECs and Cambridge Technicals.\u0027These subjects are rightly assessed differently to A-levels, and the overwhelming majority of results are in line with centre assessment grades.\u0027A minority of vocational and technical qualifications used a statistical model similar to the one Ofqual used for A-levels and GCSEs, and Ofqual has asked these awarding organisations to review their approaches to make sure no student is disadvantaged.\u0027   "},{"url":null,"title":"Madeleine McCann prime suspect Christian Brueckner accomplice witness says","story":"Share this articleMadeleine McCann suspect Christian B had an accomplice during child sex crime in Portugal, says witness"},{"url":null,"title":"British holidaymakers reveal minute dash Croatia","story":"Share this articlePortugal holidays back on but Croatia struck from quarantine-free travelHolidaymakers in Croatia pay hundreds of pounds for alternatives routes home to avoid quarantine | London Evening Standard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f29d61c10cc02ba03dfab64d8783edcc6a9971/0_393_5930_3560/master/5930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7efad45dc4cb5fa856f2a4424be1a30","title":"loved and lost simon bray photo essay","story":"Photographer Simon Bray’s project Loved and Lost deals with the loss of loved ones. He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262bd47df0273479ce12d1d4acff1b965c4f27a8/98_0_2805_1684/master/2805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd758df1e35b1129e4b16cea55a4e28","title":"matt herron chronicler of the us civil rights movement in pictures","story":"The photographer, who covered protesters and volunteers across the south, has died at 89.

But as infection rates have risen again in parts of the region, some earlier curbs have been reinstated.The latest data, which was published on Friday and focused on the services and manufacturing sectors, is likely to concern policymakers and diminish hopes for a V-shaped recovery, signalling slowing growth. IHS Markit’s flash composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell from 54.9 in July to 51.6. Any number above 50 signals growth.“The fallback in the eurozone composite PMI in August suggests the initial V-shaped rebound following the lifting of the lockdowns is already fizzling out,” said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.The flow of new business for firms slowed and once again some of August’s activity was derived by companies completing work backlogs. Germany and France, the bloc’s two biggest economies, also lost economic momentum this month, driven by a services slowdown.Apart from those economies, activity decreased marginally in August, IHS Markit said.Growth in the eurozone’s dominant service sector stalled, with the its PMI index falling to 50.1 from 54.7.With demand waning, the bloc’s services firms cut headcount for a sixth month in a row, and more sharply than in July. Economists noted the employment components of the PMIs suggested more gloom ahead in the jobs market.“Those numbers indicate that the worst is yet to be seen in the euro area labour market and clearly points to a gradual recovery path,” said Tuuli Koivu at Nordea Markets.Factory activity – which did not experience quite as sharp a decline as the service industry during the height of the pandemic – expanded for a second month.But in a sign that factory purchasing managers do not expect a big pick up in activity, they again bought fewer raw materials than in the previous month.EU leaders agreed last month a €750bn (£674bn) pandemic recovery fund, but the relief does not kick in until next year. For its part, the European Central Bank is expected to keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a long time.A full bounceback from the eurozone’s deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b5800a570370eb6a4dbf095a2696104bab8d9a/0_379_5758_3456/master/5758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138856ccdc90414b0c143483737751c0","title":"five factors behind the us stock markets miraculous turnaround","story":"Despite looking anything but fearless as Covid-19 first struck, US markets have regained lost ground and reached new highs. We list the reasons whyNothing like the recovery in the US stock market has ever been seen before. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the time it took for shares to regain their previous peak was measured in decades. After the global financial crisis of 2008, it was measured in years. This time it has taken less than five months – from a low on 23 March – for the S\u0026ampP 500 to regain all its lost ground and hit a new high. At the time, not even the most bullish trader would have been bet on such a rapid recovery, but five factors explain the remarkable turnaround.Even while the market was crashing in early March, America’s central bank was acting to reassure investors that it would go to any lengths to support the world’s biggest economy and prevent a financial crisis.As in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the Fed moved swiftly: it cut interest rates to zero it promised to pump $5 trillion into the troubled money markets it created lending programmes to help the cash flow of US businesses big and small it bought corporate bonds and it has given the impression that it may buy stocks as well.Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global, says the rally on Wall Street and the recent fall in the US dollar are “being driven primarily by central bank policies of adding unprecedented liquidity to markets through renewed quantitative easing and ultra-low rates.”The lockdown has been disastrous for some sectors, notably hospitality and airlines, but people stuck at home have been spending more time online, shopping, watching, socialising and working. That has been good news for the five big US tech giants – Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix.Dhaval Joshi, analyst at BCA research, says the S\u0026ampP 500 should be renamed the S\u0026ampP 5 because it is now so dominated by a handful of companies. Likewise, about 10 stocks – mostly in finance and energy – drive the UK’s FTSE 100.Traditionally, Wall Street looks beyond the short term and anticipates that a company’s earnings – on which its stock market valuation ultimately depends – will recover.However, some investors, including Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund, say this is risky at a time when Covid-19 is not beaten. Trond Grande, the fund’s deputy chief executive, said markets did not reflect the real economic impact of the virus, which was not under control “in any shape or form”.The devastating economic impact of Covid-19 has meant a worldwide race to find a vaccine. Normally this takes years, but there are hopeful signs – including from researchers at Oxford University – that the process could be speeded up.Wall Street has proved highly sensitive to reports of a possible breakthrough, from either US biotech companies such as Gilead or foreign rivals. But even on the most optimistic assumption, a vaccine will not be widely available until 2021 at the earliest, and the chances of failure are high. But for the past few months, vaccine optimism has helped boost not just pharma shares but Wall Street stocks generally.In the early stages of the pandemic, investors dumped shares and parked their money in traditional safe havens such as cash and US treasury bonds. But the actions of the Fed and other central banks have made these options less attractive.Interest rates for savers are barely above zero, and in some countries the interest rates (yields) on government bonds have turned negative, which means investors have to pay the state for the privilege of putting their money in a safe asset.For investors who believe shares are overvalued, there is gold, whose price has risen by almost $400 an ounce in the past six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36fc8a16ec54184a96153f7a0e37ef4c4970409/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9be4b09847330ba050eb22001140ede6","title":"journeys end last of englands open cast mines begins final push","story":"Hartington site in Derbyshire will be allowed to eke out last of its coal over rest of year owing to pandemicFew in the small town of Staveley, near Chesterfield, could have predicted that an overlooked industrial site on its outskirts would play host to the end of thousands of years of coal mining in England.The Hartington site stands unassumingly within the green hills of Derbyshire where it produces a small handful of coal, in industry terms, alongside gravel and construction grit. It is also, by chance, England’s last open-cast coal mine in a history that dates back to Roman times.The Hartington site can trace its roots in the mining industry back more than 140 years to when it first began producing coal for the Staveley Coal and Iron Company in 1875. Then, the company’s 3,000 workers produced 1m tonnes of coal a year. Today, Hartington is a minnow within the fast-draining coal industry and aims to produce a total of 87,000 tonnes.Government officials had expected Hartington to reach its modest target by the start of August, but delays caused by the coronavirus has meant the mine will be allowed to continue to eke out the last of its coal for the rest of the year.By sheer chance Hartington will outlive England’s far larger surface mines, including Bradley in County Durham which shut on Monday  after extracting 340,000 of 500,000 tonnes of coal earmarked when it opened in 2018.John Wilson, a local businessman, owns Hartington alongside interests in local hotels and a recycling company.The last open-cast mine in England will continue to produce coal alongside a handful of mines still operating in Wales and Scotland, and a few small underground mines in Cumbria and the Forest of Dean.These mines may tap the same rich coal seams that helped power the Industrial Revolution, but they are a dusty shadow of one of the country’s most enduring industry. At its peak in 1913, Britain produced 292m tonnes of coal a year. Last year, a record low of 2.2m tonnes was produced after 35 years of accelerating mine closures.It has been almost five years since 60 miners emerged for the final time from Britain’s last deep mine at Kellingley in North Yorkshire. The closure of the mine, which survived the Thatcher years and countless union strikes, marked yet another blow to the communities of former mining towns in the north of England.The Hartington mine was one of the earliest casualties of the terminal decline in heavy industry after the first world war, shutting in 1921 after a miner strike before taking up a new life as a tip for other local mines and steel foundries.At the centre of Staveley’s market square stands a clocktower monument to the town’s industrial past, but few are here to see it today. Since the collapse of industry in Staveley the town has emptied. The woes of its remaining small businesses have been compounded by recession, years of austerity, and the collapse of the British high street.The owner of the nearby cobbler, who gave his name as Bobbo, said the exodus from the town centre had accelerated as young people left Staveley to find work. “The politicians say they understand that things are difficult in former industrial towns, but they keep putting money in the pockets of foreign workers by importing everything. So, isn’t that hypocritical?” he said.Today, the UK imports of 6m tonnes of coal a year, mostly from Russian mines, despite the collapse in demand for coal in the production of steel and energy in power plants. It is a fact seized upon by those hoping to spur a coal mining renaissance in the UK despite the government’s climate targets.Government ministers are considering plans for new open-cast mines, and caused dismay among environmental groups late last year by waiving through plans – still fiercely opposed – for the first new deep cast mine in a generation at the Woodhouse colliery in Cumbria.A government spokesman told the  that although Britain’s transition towards a low carbon future had “inevitably reduced the country’s dependence on coal extraction and use”, the government was “supporting the creation of new, sustainable employment opportunities in the green economy, which is predicted to support 2 million jobs by 2030”.For Britain’s former mining towns, a green industrial boom cannot come soon enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d9b0761a5eb7aec45ae16e4a09d2d347d9bde3/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ef55aa6e42a0187b88aa5b314a86fb2","title":"we knew they were experts sta clients and staff look back covid 19","story":"As company falls victim to Covid-19, travellers reflect on joy of experienced people helping to book holidaysNews that STA Travel has become the latest to fall victim to the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted an outpouring of sadness and nostalgia from former customers and staff.Known for its enthusiastic staff and its budget round-the-world plane tickets, generations of students would flock to STA Travel stores to book gap years and summer breaks through the company – or simply to gaze longingly at the adventures it promised.Its bright yellow and blue signage has been a familiar sight on high streets and university campuses for decades, but now after it confirmed it had ceased trading on Friday, 54 UK stores look set to close their doors, putting 500 jobs at risk.Lowri Lloyd Owen from near Aberystwyth worked for the company for 10 years, first as a travel expert and then as a store manager. She said she felt “extremely saddened” when she heard the news. The job enabled her to move to Australia, where she lived for eight years and started her family.“The 10 years I spent working for this company taught me so much, took me to places far and wide and I met lifelong friends along the way, many of whom are still employees and will be facing very difficult times ahead,” she said. “Selling travel is the most awesome thing you can sell someone.”She was not surprised by the reaction to the news. “Whether you were an STA customer or an employee, it was a company that supported young people often at the start of their travels or career and that stays with you,” she said.Tim Walker, who runs Beaumont Music and lives in West Sussex, was one of the company’s loyal customers when he was a student in the early 2000s. He used the travel agent from the age of 18 to 22 to book his gap-year adventure as well as summer trips while at university.“I remember booking flights to Mexico and the staff member calling over a colleague who had just returned from their own trip.

I had always wanted to do it and I asked a couple of friends to go but they didn’t want to. So I was a little discouraged, but decided to go anyway.”STA Travel made her feel more comfortable about going on her own. They produced flyers about solo travel for women, which Adewa-Faboro studied before going. “I was a solo traveller, aged 19, and my family in Nigeria thought I was crazy. But I thought I only live once so I just decided to do it. STA made me feel really safe about it. I had six magical days there.“The team were amazing in making a foreign student from Nigeria’s dream come true. Money was tight so they booked me into two separate hostels to save me money. They were brilliant.”It wasn’t just students booking gap years and post-university travels. STA Travel, founded by two Australian backpackers in Melbourne in 1979, originally stood for Student Travel Australia, but it branched out to a wider customer base and rebranded itself to become Start the Adventure.“I remember going to their store in Covent Garden and a lovely lady – Annie, I think – helped us plan out the whole trip.”Butler, who runs the Sugar Tea Room in north London, said: “We were both sad to hear about STA travel closing because it wasn’t just for students, they had the best prices for long-haul travel.”Afsaneh Parvizi-Wayne, the founder of the period product brand Freda, who lives in London, has fond memories of using STA Travel to go to the Gambia, Senegal and Guinea Bissau when she was a student more than 30 years ago.She said: “We used to have an STA in the University of London Union in the 80s when we still had holiday brochures and you could discuss your trip in person with someone who’d probably done that trip already. It wasn’t just the student discount but also the student perspective and tips in a non-internet era. I’m so sad to see it go.”Another former customer, Ellie Dix, a board game designer from Hertfordshire, has been reminiscing about Camp America, which she booked through STA Travel in the 90s.“I was at Birmingham University from 1994 to 1997 and we had an STA Travel on campus. I remember going and just gazing at the options as a sort of escapism from student life. I did Camp America for two years running in 1996 and 1997 and STA dealt with the travel.“I don’t remember actually thinking there was any other way to travel as a student other than with STA. It was STA or nothing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dcc0c33624ef0d4bb352eb09e81e5ef2a4ef5cb/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=80c2964678e1a3ed2a16bbc1311310ea","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.

(Its jellyfish webcam, meanwhile, was highlighted on Reddit as one of “the best links to click while you’re stoned”.)With 1 million followers on Facebook and now 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, social media has long been central to the aquarium’s mission to inspire ocean conservation. Its first webcams were installed in 2001.But with no date set for reopening, Monterey Bay’s only presence during the pandemic is online, and at a time of great financial need. “It’s a lot of pressure right now to be the public face of the aquarium,” said Allen-Greil.The institution is facing a $45m (£34m) shortfall this year and 174 staff have already lost their jobs: “We have needed more than ever this summer to use these tools for fundraising and to make clear our need.”Monterey Bay’s call for its followers to appeal for emergency congressional funding for aquariums yielded 10,000 responses, as well as $27,000 in direct giving.The aquarium has been exploring new potential sources of revenue, such as educational talks held in the world of the game Animal Crossing, live-streamed over Twitch and YouTube tours behind the scenes of the jellyfish and cephalopod exhibits.“We’ve got a ton of requests like, ‘Can you just Zoom my grandmother on her birthday and feed a penguin? I’ll pay’,” said Allen-Greil. “We’re thinking a lot about what that means for us.”Though online initiatives alone would not save the aquarium, she said, “once we’re ready to open, we’re confident that we’ll have people wanting to come.”Until then: “it’s about bringing the ocean to people in their daily lives.”The National aquarium has three webcams: Blacktip reef sharks, Jellies invasion and Pacific coral reef.Spot more than 50 species of fish in this 100ft tunnel.Choose from 10 live webcams and tune in at the listed times for narrated feedings.Explore.org is the largest live nature cam network, with 21 underwater streams.The Aquarium of the Pacific, Long Beach, CaliforniaBoasts round-the-clock surveillance of its penguin exhibit – above and below water.• This article was amended on 21 August 2020 to correct the caption of the main image.

I have been singing the praises of cauliflowers, tomatoes, lemons and the mighty aubergine for years. But while it’s my mission to present vegetables in new and exciting ways, I must confess to a niggling doubt: how many more ways are there to roast a cauliflower, slice a tomato, squeeze a lemon or fry an aubergine?The answer, I’m delighted to report, is many, and in my latest foray, I have been joined by my brilliant colleague and co-writer Ixta Belfrage. Our journey of discovery into the world of vegetables has focused on understanding what makes each one distinct, so they can be tasted afresh. It’s about creating flavour bombs, and it’s done in these three ways.One way to ramp up flavour in a vegetable is to subject it to a process before or during cooking. Three recipes in our new book involve cooking celeriac whole for more than two hours, then dressing and serving it in different ways. During the initial cooking, something magical happens. Much of the water in the celeriac evaporates it turns golden brown, and becomes sweeter and richer. This caramelising is key. Whatever you choose to do – if anything – after this is less important the browning process is such a flavour bomb that the celeriac is heavenly eaten at this stage, cut into wedges and served with a squeeze of lemon or a dollop of creme fraiche. Other processes that elevate vegetables to great heights include charring, ageing and infusing.It’s not so much what you do to an ingredient (“process”) or the ingredient itself (“produce”), but the combination of ingredients in the four most important pairings.Acidity Acidic substances can act as preservatives, improve texture (causing vegetables to cook more slowly and toughen up) and, best of all, balance flavours. A favourite sandwich of ours – a mix of olive oil-roasted vegetables and chillies, piled on toasted sourdough with pecorino shavings or crumbled feta on top – wouldn’t hit the spot without the acidic element counteracting the sweetness and chilli heat.Chilli heat Fresh, pickled, dried, flaked, in pastes, oils, butters and spice mixes: our kitchen is crowded with varities of chilli because the question, “What’s needed?” in a dish is so often answered with “chilli heat”. Chillies’ great gift is their ability to marry together a range of flavours to create a singular harmony.Sweetness All ingredients are a mix of things – sweet and salty, sweet and savoury – and these tastes need each other in order to shine. What would bitter cocoa powder be without sweet sugar? Satisfaction is about the combination, the layering, the contrast of tastes. With sweetness in particular, without the complexity, you run the risk of turning your dish into a dessert. Fat Take a simple salad – tomato and basil, say – and it’s one thing: sweet, refreshing and lovely. Add mozzarella, though, or tangy feta, and it becomes something entirely different. It’s no longer just the picture: it’s the entire summer holiday. Add another layer of fat in the form of olive oil and the dish is complete.In some cases, there’s so much going on within the ingredient that it can pretty much do all the work on its own, its deliciousness teased out by baking or toasting or frying.Such ingredients are often intensely savoury, and rich in the fifth flavour, umami (the others are sweet, sour, salty and bitter), the result of flavour compounds called glutamates. Unlike monosodium glutamate (chemically manufactured and liberally sprinkled over takeaways), there are many natural sources: parmesan, anchovies, mushrooms, tomatoes, soy sauce, seaweed, Marmite and ketchup.After years of cooking vegetables, I never cease to be surprised by their chameleon-like ability to take on flavour and metamorphose from one dish to the next. A simple cauliflower can reinvent itself, showing up as a seductive Levantine fritter, then grilled with saffron and raisins, disguised as bulgur in a modern take on tabbouleh, followed by a glamorous savoury cake, a meaty steak, dressed as (coronation) chicken or simply served whole, grilled yet unadorned. This is how wide the range and how wondrous the potential of every single vegetable. Magical, to borrow a term favoured by my five-year-old son.Preparing vegetables hasselback involves slicing them thinly, but not all the way down, so the slices remain held together at the base, like a fan: they not only look great but have deliciously crispy edges all over.To offset the extra work, start with shop-bought ready-cooked beetroots (plain, not in vinegar). If you do end up using raw beets, try to get bunches and use the stems and leaves to make our tempura stems, leaves and herbs.Serves 4 as a side8-10 medium-large beetroots (that’s about 2 bunches), skin on (1.2kg) or 8-10 ready-cooked beetroots (1kg)Flaked sea saltFor the lime leaf butter90g unsalted butter40ml olive oil5 fresh kaffir lime leaves, chopped10g fresh ginger, peeled and chopped1 garlic clove, crushed1 tbsp lime juice, plus 2 tsp to serveFor the lime leaf salsa10 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks removed and very finely chopped½ tsp fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped½ garlic clove, crushed½ green chilli, very finely chopped (deseeded for less heat)1 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped3 tbsp olive oilFor the yoghurt cream80ml double cream90g Greek-style yoghurtHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan) 425Fgas 7. Place the beets in a baking dish in a single layer. Fill with water to 2cm up the sides, sprinkle on one tablespoon of salt, cover tightly with foil and bake for one hour and 20 minutes, or until a knife goes through easily. Discard water and, when cool enough, peel off the skin under cold running water (wear gloves to avoid staining). Halve larger beetroots lengthways. Reduce oven temperature to 190C.While the beetroots are cooking, put the butter, oil, lime leaves, ginger and garlic into a small pan on a medium-high heat. Gently cook until the butter begins to bubble, about four minutes, then set aside to infuse for at least 40 minutes. Discard the aromatics, then stir in one tablespoon of lime juice and one teaspoon of flaked salt.For the salsa, mix all the ingredients in a small bowl with a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.In a medium bowl, whip the cream, yoghurt and a pinch of flaked salt until light and fluffy, with medium-stiff peaks, about three minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use.Cut slits in the peeled beetroots at 4mm intervals, stopping about 1cm from the bottom. Place on a small parchment-lined baking tray and fan the slices out. Spoon the melted butter evenly over, especially between the slices. Roast for one and a quarter hours, basting very well every 20 minutes or so, until the edges are crisp and caramelised. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Spread the yoghurt cream on a platter, then arrange the beets on top, spooning the butter over. Drizzle over the salsa, finish with remaining lime juice and serve at once.Huge quantities of beets are roasted across the Ottolenghi restaurants, so we’re always on the lookout for clever ways of using the stems and leaves. If you don’t have any, use basil, parsley, sage or chard. Just make sure the leaves are not limp and wet, or hard and dry. The batter will be enough for 100g of leaves and herbs.Make sure your prep is done before the oil gets too hot and have a slotted spoon and a rack lined with kitchen paper at the ready. Tempura doesn’t sit too well, so try to eat it right away.Serves 6 as a snack or a little starter70g beetroot leaves and stems (cut to 8cm lengths), washed and patted dry20g dill, patted dry, in 8cm fronds10g mint, patted dry, leaves picked½ tbsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed with a pestle and mortarFlaked sea saltFor the tangerine dipping sauce50ml tangerine juice, with bits (from 2-3 tangerines)3 tbsp lime juice1½ tsp maple syrup ½ small garlic clove, finely chopped4 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks discarded and leaves finely chopped½ red chilli, deseeded and choppedFor the batter80g self-raising flour80g cornflour, plus 50g for dipping210ml ice-cold sparkling water (small bits of ice welcome)1½ tbsp black sesame seeds700ml sunflower oil, for deep-fryingIn a small serving bowl, stir together all the dipping sauce ingredients with an eighth of a teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.For the batter, put the flour, 80g of cornflour, water, one teaspoon of flaked salt and the seeds into a large bowl. Whisk gently until the mixture just comes together.Pour the oil into a medium high-sided saute pan and place on a high heat. Once very hot, lower to medium and test by dropping in a little batter it should sizzle but not brown straight away. In batches, toss stems, leaves and herbs in the 50g of cornflour, shake to remove any excess, then dip in the batter. Lift, shake the excess over the bowl, then place as many pieces in the oil as can comfortably fit without touching. Fry for 30-60 seconds on each side, until crisp and pale golden, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to a kitchen paper-lined rack. Continue with the rest, then sprinkle the lot with the pepper and salt. Transfer to a platter and serve hot with the dipping sauce alongside.In 2016, the German minister for agriculture wanted to ban naming vegetable-based foods after their meaty counterparts, claiming terms such as “vegetarian schnitzel” were unsettling and misleading. Ours aren’t vegetarian schnitzels, they are vegetable ones – a semantic difference but a big one. In any case, we hope our choice of title does not offend.The sauce is a take on the classic Marie Rose but turbocharged. It’s also great in sandwiches and will keep in the fridge for up to a week. Serves 4 as a starter8 red Romano peppers (850g)Salt, flaked sea salt and black pepper100g plain flour4 eggs, beaten100g panko breadcrumbs60g sesame seeds, white andor black16 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks discarded and leaves finely chopped1 tbsp nori sprinkles (or blitz a sheet of nori in a spice grinder and use 1 tbsp)600ml sunflower oil, for deep-frying2 limes: finely grate the zest to get 2 tsp, then cut into wedges to serveFor the Marie Rose sauce 1 whole head of garlic, top fifth cut off to expose the clovesSalt and black pepper180g cherry tomatoes4 large red chillies (75g)1 tbsp maple syrup2 tsp Worcestershire sauce½ tsp chipotle flakes60g mayonnaiseHeat the oven to 250C (230C fan)480Fgas 9½. To make the sauce, sprinkle the garlic with salt and pepper, wrap in foil and place on a parchment-lined baking tray with the tomatoes and chillies. Roast for 30 minutes, until they begin to blacken and blister. Remove from oven and, when cool, squeeze the garlic into the small bowl of a food processor, discarding the skins. Add the chillies (deseeded for less heat), tomatoes, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle flakes and a quarter-teaspoon of salt blitz to a coarse paste. Leave to cool, then mix in the mayonnaise and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve.Meanwhile, cut a 5cm slit vertically in the base of each pepper, then place on a large parchment-lined baking tray (you can roast them at the same time as the garlic, near the bottom of the oven). Roast for 16 minutes, turning over halfway, until cooked through and beginning to blacken. Transfer to a sieve, cut side down, to drain any liquid, taking care to keep the stalks intact. Once cool, carefully peel away as much skin as possible without puncturing the flesh, then sprinkle with salt and set aside.Prepare three shallow containers long enough to fit the peppers. In the first, mix flour with one teaspoon of flaked salt and plenty of black pepper put the eggs in the second in the last mix breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, lime leaves, nori, two teaspoons of flaked salt and a generous grind of pepper.Set a large metal rack over one tray and line another with plenty of kitchen paper. Dip each pepper first into the flour, then the egg and finally the panko mixture, shaking off any excess as you go lie it on the rack and repeat with the rest of the peppers.Pour the oil into a large, high-sided saute pan or wok on a medium-high heat. Once very hot, fry the peppers two at a time so you don’t overcrowd them. Lower in carefully and fry for one and a half to two minutes on each side, until golden brown and crisp, then transfer to the paper-lined tray.Serve at once, with lime zest and sea salt sprinkled on top, and lime wedges and Marie Rose sauce alongside.Lime, chilli and garlic are the key flavours here, coming through the oil and the crispy sprinkle at the end. If using dried beans, soak a day ahead with tinned or jarred, add to the cooked shallots with 60ml of water and cook just until heated through.Serves 4 as a side2 banana shallots, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed4 fresh kaffir lime leaves1 ancho chilli, torn in halfSalt350g black turtle beans, soaked all night in cold water with 1 tsp bicarb of soda (or 800g cooked beans)3 tbsp lime juice½ small coconut, roughly grated (50g)For the fried aromatics 90ml olive oil 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced2 red chillies, thinly sliced in rounds10 fresh kaffir lime leaves2 tsp black mustard seedsStart with the aromatics. Heat oil in a small pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, reduce heat to medium, add garlic, chillies and lime leaves, and fry for two minutes, stirring. Add mustard seeds and fry for another 30 seconds, until the garlic starts to turn golden brown. Strain over a bowl. Set aromatics and oil aside separately.For the beans, put three tablespoons of reserved oil into a medium pan on a medium-high heat add shallots, garlic, lime leaves, ancho chilli and one and a quarter teaspoons of salt. Reduce heat to medium and fry for six minutes, stirring often, until the shallots are soft and golden. Rinse beans, then add to pan with 700ml water. Bring to a simmer, lower heat to medium and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked but still holding their shape. Remove from heat, cover and leave for 10 minutes.Transfer to a lipped platter or large, shallow bowl. Discard lime leaves and ancho chilli. Drizzle over lime juice and remaining oil, top with coconut and fried aromatics, and serve.We urge you to try our version of rasam, a South Indian broth, despite the longish ingredient list, to discover a whole range of new flavours.Use tamarind pulp, not paste (available in any Indian supermarket), to get the sweet acid kick you’re after.You’ll need to soak the rice for an hour in water. The balls can be made ahead and kept refrigerated in a sealed container return to room temperature before pouring over the hot broth.Serves 4 as a main50g block of tamarind pulp30g ginger, skin on, thinly sliced15g turmeric, skin on, thinly sliced1 large green chilli, roughly slicedSalt250g cherry tomatoes2½ tbsp sunflower oil½ lemon, halved lengthways, cut into ¼cm-thick half-moons (pips removed)1½ tsp cumin seeds, finely crushed1 tsp black mustard seeds2 whole dried red chillies20 fresh curry leaves (optional)3 garlic cloves, crushed3-4 plum tomatoes (300g), coarsely grated and skins discarded (250g)2 tsp caster sugarFor the rice balls200g Thai sticky rice, soaked for 1 hour in cold water, then drained well2 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for shaping1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed15g fresh ginger, peeled and grated10g coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra picked leaves and stalks2 spring onions, thinly sliced (30g)For the rasam, add the first four ingredients, 1.2 litres of water and one teaspoon of salt to a medium pan on a medium-high heat. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 20 minutes, stirring to break apart the pulp. Push through a sieve into a bowl, then discard the aromatics.Meanwhile, put rice in a medium pan with 220ml water and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Bring to the boil on medium-high heat, then lower heat and cover loosely, leaving a small gap for steam to escape. Cook for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and let sit, uncovered, until cool.Toss cherry tomatoes in one and a half teaspoons of oil. Place a large saute pan on a high heat. Once smoking, add tomatoes and cook, tossing occasionally, until charred and blistered, about four minutes. Set aside. Add lemons and cook until charred, 30-50 seconds a side. Set aside. Turn heat down to medium-high, add remaining oil, cumin and mustard seeds, dried chillies, curry leaves and garlic, and cook for 90 seconds, until fragrant. Add grated plum tomatoes cook for five minutes more, then add sugar, tamarind liquid, charred tomatoes and half a teaspoon of salt. Bring back to the boil and simmer for eight minutes. Set aside while you prepare the rice balls.Put the oil into a saute pan on a medium-high heat. Add onion and cook for seven minutes, until soft and browned. Add garlic and ginger, and cook for 90 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl with the cooked rice, coriander and spring onion. Mix well. With lightly oiled hands, form into 12 balls (30-35g each).To serve, heat through the rasam, then add charred lemon slices. Divide rice balls between four bowls, pour over the rasam and top with coriander.These onions are a revelation, and the very definition of low efforthigh impact. Two things are vital, though: the roasting tray must be big enough to fit 16 onion halves (if not, roast fewer, decreasing other ingredients proportionally) and these must be basted well, so they remain moist. Serve spooned over toast, mashed potatoes or rice, or with roast chicken.Serves 6 as a sideHeat the oven to 260C (240C fan)500Fgas 10. Halve the onions lengthways, trim tops and a little off the bottom (you want the halves held together at the base).Whisk butter, miso and one litre of warm water until fully combined.Space apart the onion halves, cut side down, in a 40cm x 28cm high-sided baking tray or dish. Pour over the miso water, cover tightly with foil, bake for 35 minutes, then remove foil and turn onions cut side up. Baste well and cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes, basting every 10 minutes, until very soft and deep brown.Carefully transfer to a platter, pouring sauce over. Serve at once.This is as fresh as a potato salad will get, thanks to the large quantities of lime, garlic, chilli and Thai basil poured over it. It will make a good light supper with broccoli and will also partner well with salmon or roast chicken.If you can’t get hold of Thai basil, use an equal combination of coriander and ordinary basil. The salsa won’t stay bright green for long, so make it just before you’re ready to serve.When jerusalem artichokes are in season, we like to roast them and add to this salad. If you’re not a fan, substitute them with the same amount of potatoes (in which case they’ll all be boiled, so no need to turn on the oven).Serves 4 as a side600g small to medium salad potatoes (or 1.1kg, if you’re not using jerusalem artichokes), peeled and cut into 3-4cm pieces Salt and flaked sea salt 600g jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into 3cm pieces (500g)  75ml olive oil 50g breakfast radishes, thinly sliced 3 limes: finely grate the zest to get 1¼ tbsp, then juice to get 3 tbsp 1 small garlic clove, roughly chopped 15g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped 28g Thai basil, 20g roughly chopped, the rest picked leaves to serve 1 large green chilli, finely sliced into rounds 30g smoked, ready-roasted and salted almonds, roughly chopped (or ordinary ready-roasted almonds) Membership Event: Flavour, with Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)450Fgas 8 (if roasting artichokes). Put the potatoes into a large pan, cover with cold, salted water, bring to a simmer, then cook for around 10 minutes, or untilcooked through but still holding their shape. Drain and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, mix artichokes (if using) with one tablespoon of oil and half a teaspoon of flaked salt, and spread out on a parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 18-20 minutes, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and cooked through. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then put into a large bowl with the cooled potatoes.While the artichokes are roasting, mix the radishes with one tablespoon of the lime juice and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.In a spice grinder or the small bowl of a food processor, blitz the lime zest, garlic, ginger and the 20g of Thai basil with one teaspoon of flaked salt and the remaining 60ml of oil to get a bright green paste. Scrape into the bowl of potatoes, with the remaining two tablespoons of lime juice. Gently stir through the radishes (including the liquid) and the picked Thai basil leaves.Finish with the chilli and almonds, and serve.On paper it may not sound as if it would work, but the combination of figs, Chinese rice wine and ricotta is marvellous. This dish is a fine balance of sweet and savoury, so it’s important your figs are ripe and sweet. If they aren’t, increase the amount of maple syrup a little.The infused oil and cooked figs need time to marinate, so make them a day ahead if you like. The figs can be cooked up to three days before and kept in the fridge (just bring back to room temperature before you assemble the salad). You can even leave them in the fridge for up to three weeks to ferment (or at least become a little funky) they make a great addition to a cheese board.Serves 4 as a starter8 ripe purple figs, halved (320g) 1 tbsp soy sauce 2½ tbsp maple syrup 2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine (or pale dry sherry) 2½ tsp Chinkiang vinegar (or half the amount of balsamic vinegar) 60ml olive oil 2 red chillies, finely sliced into rounds (20g) 1 lemon: finely shave the skin to get 5 strips 60g rocket 140g ricottaHeat the oven to its highest grill setting. Toss the figs with the soy sauce and one and a half tablespoons of maple syrup, then arrange, cut side up and spaced apart, on a medium, parchment-lined baking tray. Make sure there is no overhanging parchment that could burn under the grill. Roast for 12 minutes on the top shelf of the oven, until they are soft and caramelised, but still holding their shape. Return figs and cooking juices to the bowl, with the rice wine, vinegar and remaining tablespoon of maple syrup. Gently mix, then set aside for at least one hour (or overnight) for the flavours to come together.Meanwhile, heat the oil in a small pan on a medium heat and, once hot, fry the chillies for three minutes, stirring to separate the slices. Add the lemon strips and fry for 30 seconds until fragrant, then immediately pour into a heatproof bowl and set aside to infuse for at least 30 minutes (or overnight).Arrange the rocket on a platter and top with the figs and dressing. Dot with spoonfuls of the ricotta, finish with the infused oil, chillies and lemon strips, and serve.• Extracted from Ottolenghi Flavour, by Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage, published by Ebury on 3 September at £27.

Despite leading, PSG haven’t found their range. They’ve sent quite a few balls unnecessarily out of play, laying waste quite a few promising situations.33 min: Diani is booked, slightly harshly, for clipping Walti as the pair stretch for a loose ball.31 min: Williamson skies a nervous clearance. Katoto and Zinsberger challenge for the ball as it descends from the clouds. Katoto wins the battle, the Arsenal keeper once again extremely hesitant when dealing with a high ball. Fortunately for Arsenal, the ball squirts harmlessly wide of goal.30 min: Van de Donk swings a cross in from the right Endler plucks calmly from the sky. Arsenal haven’t forced the PSG keeper into serious work yet.28 min: All a bit scrappy now. PSG seem much happier than Arsenal to let the game drift on.26 min: And then suddenly PSG spring forward, Bachmann and Diani combining well down the right, nearly opening Arsenal up but not quite. Yet another heavy PSG touch lets Arsenal off the hook again.25 min: Arsenal continue to hog the ball, but it’s sterile possession.23 min: Little is causing Dudek problems down the Arsenal right. She’s got no right to even reach a loose ball, but gets in ahead of her opponent and earns a corner. Mead’s delivery is once again lacking, and an easy claim for Endler in the PSG goal.21 min: Katoto chips a delicate defence-splitting pass down the PSG inside-left channel. She’s sent Dabritz clear, but a heavy touch runs the ball out for a goal kick. That’s a let-off for Arsenal, whose defence was caught cold.19 min: Little dribbles hard down the right, bustling past a couple of stern challenges but crossing to nobody in particular. This is a good response to going behind by Arsenal, though. PSG had been completely on top, and the opener was no surprise, so they really needed this positive reaction.17 min: Arsenal should be level in short order. Evans slips a pass down the right for the overlapping Maritz, who pulls one back from the byline for Little. She must score, eight yards out, but smashes her first-time shot inches wide right. What a chance!Nadim curls it to Katoto on the penalty spot. She takes a step forward to lose Williamson, and guides a fine volley into the bottom right! It had been coming.14 min: Dabritz curls it into the mixer. Paredes sidefoots goalwards but it hits a falling Arsenal defender. They want a penalty. They’re not getting one. PSG come again, Paredes challenging an uncertain Zinsberger under a high ball and clattering her. Free kick. PSG come again, again, winning a corner down the right. And from that ... 12 min: Diani turns sharply down the left and is unceremoniously blocked by Van de Donk. Now it’s PSG’s turn to load the box ahead of a free kick.11 min: Bachmann bundles Little to the floor and this is a free kick out on the right, a chance to load the box. But once again Mead’s delivery is below par, failing to beat the first woman. PSG clear their lines.10 min: The corner’s wasted, Mead shanking it straight out for a goal kick. But at least Arsenal have shown something in attack now.9 min: Diani works her way in from the right and reaches the byline, but cuts back to nobody. A fine run, though. Arsenal go straight up the other end, Little winning a corner off Dudek down the right.7 min: Mead slides through the back of Lawrence near the halfway line. She’s slightly fortunate not to go into the book for that overly aggressive lunge the referee leaves it at a stern talking-to.6 min: PSG are enjoying the bulk of the possession in these early exchanges. Their passes are sticking Arsenal have yet to string anything of note together.4 min: Maritz loses possession out on the PSG left, allowing Katoto to drive down the flank and glide infield. She shuttles the ball on for Bachmann, who tries an ambitious backheel from a very tight angle to the left of the Arsenal goal. It’s not half-bad, either, but Zinsberger isn’t going to be beaten at her near post.2 min: Other than that, it’s a slightly frantic start at an eerily quiet Anoeta.1 min: PSG are quickly on the front foot, Bachmann spraying a pass wide right to send Diani off down the wing. But Diani runs the ball out for a goal kick with uncharacteristic clumsiness. Arsenal were napping at the back there, and it’s an early opportunity to carve out a chance gone.PSG get the ball rolling. But not before all the players take a knee of solidarity and love. Black lives matter.The teams are out! Pennants have been swapped, team photos taken, coins tossed, fists bumped. We’ll be off soon. But before kick-off, a minute of silence to remember all those who have lost their lives to this dreadful virus. RIP.Arsenal coach Joe Montemurro speaks: “The break has been fantastic for Kim Little, so we haven’t had to rush her back from injury. Effectively she’s had the time to recover properly. And the whole group has been able to freshen up from a mental perspective, so we’re looking forward to tonight. Noelle Maritz is a player with experience in the Champions League, and a right-sided player that suits our style. She’ll be ready and will complement what we want to do. To be back in football on this great occasion is where we want to be. We hope the fans will see a great game!”It’s been a while ... so why not reacquaint yourself with tonight’s teams?The other changing room. Moving pictures! In glorious technicolor! With slightly disquieting minimalist soundtrack!Kit-and-caboodle watch. Arsenal’s 2020-21 away shirt is delicious, isn’t it, and now I want an ice-cream. Meanwhile that’s a fine pennant captain Kim Little will be handing over this evening: metal rod, quality stitching, luxury tassels. Just a shame the club insist on sticking with that cookie-cutter crest: substitute it for the old elaborate Victoria Concordia Crescit number, the iconic standalone cannon with little AFC balls, or ideally that Art Deco number that used to be all over Highbury, and what a gift that would be.Noelle Maritz makes her debut for Arsenal at right-back. The Swiss international is formerly of Wolfsburg and therefore has an extensive medal collection already, despite being just 24 years old: five for the Bundesliga and another for the 2014 Champions League. Influential midfielder Jordan Nobbs doesn’t make the starting XI.PSG have a Swiss debutant of their own in the shape of the aforementioned Bachmann. On their bench: the evergreen Brazilian midfielder Formiga, who at 42 could become the oldest player to feature at this stage of the Women’s Champions League.Arsenal don’t have a particularly good record against French teams.  Then again, most of the time they’ve been coming up against Lyon, by some distance the best team in the world. Lyon beat them 3-2 on aggregate in the 2007-08 Women’s Cup quarters 3-0 in the 2008-09 Women’s Cup groups and 5-2 on aggregate in the 2010-11 Women’s Champions League semis. Throw in a 3-2 aggregate victory in the 2001-02 Women’s Cup quarters for Toulouse and ... well, sequences are there to be broken, aren’t they.This looks like a pretty well-balanced tie. PSG finished second to Lyon in Division 1 Féminine this season after the league was abandoned Arsenal came third behind Chelsea and Manchester City in the Women’s Super League when the points per game were vied up. Arsenal’s star is unquestionably Netherlands international Vivianne Miedema, who has been the leading scorer in England for the past two seasons France international Kadidiatou Diani turned down an offer from Lyon to keep banging them in for PSG.PSG also welcome to their ranks Ramona Bachmann ... who Arsenal fans may recall with a shudder, the Swiss star the woman of 2018 FA Cup final, which ended in a resounding victory for Chelsea.But then Parisians will be a-shiver as well: Miedema has ten goals to her name already in this season’s tournament, a record even better than the world’s best, Ada Hegerberg, going into this final phase in the Basque Country.PSG have reached the final of this competition twice, losing to Frankfurt in 2015 and Lyon in 2017. Arsenal however are the only English team to taste success, winning this in its previous Women’s Cup incarnation, seeing off Umea 1-0 on aggregate in 2007. Good luck calling whose dream stays alive tonight. It’s a one-off tie. It could go to extra time. And even penalties. It’s on!Kick off: 7pm BST, 8pm at the Anoeta, home of Real Sociedad in lovely San Sebastian."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b72cf5081b8ede8ded0b8763c7e147daad4ff05/48_192_3463_2078/master/3463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b26f534dff9e97f16ed8a8c1282a747b","title":"lyon v bayern munich womens champions league quarter final live","story":"33 min: Bronze nudges the ball back to Bouhaddi after Bayern counterattacked down the right wing. Things are heating up a little.32 min: ... Majri tries to pick out Renard, but Bayern clear.30 min: Bronze goes on a rampaging run after stealing possession inside her own half. She flew down the right flank, with Dallmann in hot pursuit. The Bayern midfielder is fortunate not to be penalised for tugging at Bronze’s shirt, much to the full-back’s amusement. Lyon do eventually win a free-kick down the left ...29 min: Bronze is penalised for catching Gwinn with a flailing left arm. Bayern win a free-kick deep inside their own half, and it’s another opportunity for them to build from the back. They are shading things at the moment.26 min: Demann limps away after a coming together with Cascarino, the exciting 23-year-old Lyon forward. It was all fairly innocuous, but the Bayern defender has definitely come off worse.23 min: Jean-Luc Vasseur will surely be a little concerned that his side have failed to stamp any real authority on the game. Bayern’s decision to go toe-to-toe with Lyon, the six-times winners of this competition, seems to be paying off.22 min: Bayern get a whiff of goal! Glas played a wonderful, arcing ball in from the right flank. Schüller threw herself at it but could not connect. That was a fine chance – Lyon were carved open – but the Bayern forward failed to meet the cross.18 min: ... Marozsan sends it in, and it’s headed back into the box at the back post, but Lyon cannot locate Renard or the lurking Buchanan. It was not the best free-kick but Bayern still had to deal with the subsequent pinball.17 min: Bronze is upended by Demann. Lyon win a free-kick, 30-odd yards from goal, on the right-hand side of the 18-yard box ...14 min: Bayern are looking composed and, perhaps most importantly, compact. Lyon are certainly not having it all their own way, with the German club seeing plenty of the ball.11 min: Nikita Parris is in one-on-one ... but the England striker is clearly offside. A booming Bronze header had found its way towards Parris. Bronze has won eight trophies in three seasons at Lyon since joining the French club from City in 2017, but is leaving at the end of this campaign. She will want to go out with a bang.10 min: Bayern cannon a ball in from the right and Lucy Bronze has to be alert to hoover up and avert the danger. Gwinn was lurking on the edge of the 18-yard box, sniffing around for any mistakes but Bronze classily preserves possession.8 min: Dallmann is fouled on halfway by Kumagai and Bayern win a free-kick on halfway, a chance to gain some territory. Bayern will equally be feeling reasonably chirpy. They are popping the ball about without truly penetrating Lyon.5 min: Aside from an early scare seconds after kick-off, when Bayern stole possession before zooming forward to the edge of the D, Lyon have looked comfortable. Bayern, too, are stroking the ball around nicely. A fairly low-key start in Bilbao.2 min: Cascarino skirts down the right flank before delivering a dangerous cross towards the front post. It forces the Bayern goalkeeper Benkarth to nudge it clear into the path of Henry, who drags wide on the edge of the 18-yard box.After a minute’s silence for the victims of the coronavirus pandemic, all players take the knee before Lyon get things started.Kick-off is less than five minutes away. Before then, a couple of pre-match stats to get stuck into: Lyon are yet to concede in this season’s Women’s Champions League knockout stages, scoring 27 without reply Bayern’s only victory in four previous Uefa competition meetings against French opponents was their 1-0 Champions League quarter-final first leg success in March 2017, against Paris Saint-Germain.Lyon come into this one having conquered in the French Cup a fortnight ago. The goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi proved the saviour as Lyon triumphed 4-3 on penalties after a goalless draw with PSG. Bouhaddi made the difference by saving Lea Khelifi’s spot kick. “I work a lot on penalties in training,” she said. Bouhaddi may have to remind us of her talents if the game is level after extra time ...Gem up on all the latest mouthwatering moves:Get the lowdown on the teams from the experts:As for the view from the Bayern camp, their manager believes they can thrive as the underdogs. “Lyon are the top favourites,” says Jens Scheuer. “But we can live with that because that means we have more to win than to lose. For Lyon, that is different because they are expected to win. That is our chance. The preparation has been very good, if short. Everyone is in good form and we’ve no injuries to report aside from our long-term ones. Lyon are an outstanding team, incredibly strong and seem to get better. However, I think we will manage to find opportunities.”Meanwhile, Arsenal are preparing to take on PSG:As a club, Bayern Munich are pretty well versed in these competitions but it is Lyon who are the record six-times winners of the Women’s Champions League, lifting the trophy in each of the previous four seasons. They are quite simply a formidable force and arrive into this game with a fifth successive European title in their sights. One of the game’s most talented players, Ada Hegerberg, the winner of the inaugural Ballon d’Or Féminin, is absent through injury, as is the France defender Griedge Mbock Bathy, but they still boast the England quartet of Lucy Bronze, Alex Greenwood, Nikita Parris and Jodie Taylor, a wily operator in attack. Bayern face an almighty task to topple Lyon but, in a one-off game, the most successful French club in history acknowledge they cannot afford a slip-up. The winner of this one will face either Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain, also in action tonight, in the semi-finals in Bilbao on Wednesday, after Wolfsburg, who demolished Glasgow City, take on Barcelona in the other semi 24 hours earlier.

There are only a few things left to sow now: winter lettuces are worth the effort, though they won’t be harvested until the end of March and early April next year, as growth slows to a standstill over winter.My favourite hardy lettuce is ‘Winter Density’ , because it is small enough to sit under a dome cloche and does well in pots on patios. If you have space, ‘Marvel Of Four Seasons’ or ‘Arctic King’ are ideal, as both are bred for cold weather. These old varieties are large lettuces – they need 30cm in each direction between plants to stand the worst of the winter weather. It’s down to root mass and the resources that come from an extensive system: if you cram your plants in, you’ll get a small root mass and a less resilient plant.To get the best flavour, use fleece or row cloches from late November onwards. Any salad that is under cover may inevitably get grey mould from the cool, damp conditions and poor air circulation. On sunnier days, air it and remove older, lower leaves that are losing vigour.You may not have space for large lettuces, but I can’t think of a home that couldn’t find space for a little coriander or rocket. Both are rapid growers and, sown now, can be harvested by October in a window box, pot or corner of the garden. The rocket varieties ‘Serrata’ and ‘Gourmet’ have a mild flavour even when the leaves mature. ‘Cruiser’ is a British-bred coriander that is slow to bolt and does well in pots. Though, truth be known, even the whole coriander seeds in your spice cupboard will germinate.If you have a porch, a cool, sunny window or a patio greenhouse, you’ll be able to keep that harvest going through winter. Sow successionally, in two-week gaps, to extend the harvest if September is warm, it’s worth doing this until the end of the month. Outdoor soil will get too cold come winter, so a pot that can be nestled somewhere sheltered will fare much better. If you have a greenhouse or polytunnel still filled with tomatoes, sow in modules to plant out when the summer crops are gone.If you missed that, your best option is to buy plug plants of things like kales, chards, pak choi, choy sum, Chinese cabbage and leaf mustards, spring cabbages and mini cauliflowers. I cannot recommend W Robinson and Son enough for its impeccable brassicas (and rhubarb and onions), which it sends out in August and September. They are tough plants that take immediately, and I’ve got a soft spot for the gingham paper they come wrapped in.

This was well after the late film director Pier Paolo Pasolini, whose work includes The Gospel According to St Matthew, made it the setting for some of his seminal pieces –but long before the trendy restaurants moved in and the New York Times coined it “an enclave of cool”.Roberta, 54, and Paolo, 57, chose to invest in a location that would provide them with creative headspace. Three decades later, it has more than paid its dues, not least during the months of Covid-19 lockdown.“We feel like it is an island in the city and we have felt so lucky to be here,” says Paolo. “It really is so special and attracts a lot of people – designers, artists and people in fashion – looking for peaceful tranquillity. It isn’t as expensive as other areas around either. We were probably among the first people who moved here and we found it perfect for our lifestyle.”Looking around the home the couple share with their teenage son Rocco, it’s easy to see why. Spacious and airy, the gallery-like space they designed and renovated with architect Adriano Pingaro 12 years ago affords them ample yet intimate room. The exterior is, says Paolo, typical of the kind of single-storey houses that you find locally. The interior, on the other hand, mirrors the aesthetic of their jewellery brand, which is celebrated for mingling old-world craft with modernist charm.A mixture of high-end furniture – including a set of Vittorio Nobili’s sought-after 1955 Medea chairs and Gio Ponti’s more prevalent 646 Leggera chair – sits alongside more quirky personal items, such as treasured vintage glass ceiling lamps and rustic wooden tables. Books that have been carefully collected from outdoor flea markets in downtown Rome abound. The look, says Paolo, is “more Italian baroque” than bohemian.Concrete floors and walls are offset by sumptuous velvets, slinky satins, lightweight linens and an extensive art collection. A piece by photographer Nan Goldin – a 40th-birthday gift to Roberta from Paolo – hangs above the bath, while a cosy glow emits from the bedside lamps, which the pair designed for the Iosselliani Design branch of their brand for GiustiniStagetti – an international contemporary design gallery in Rome.It is, however, the exterior element of this interior that really brings their home to life. Outside space was non-negotiable for the couple, and their home is sandwiched between two gardens. The polished concrete walls and floors that are found throughout the house extend into the outside area, which features a cuboid bath of the same material. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors, meanwhile, form invisible barriers between the two terrains.“In a big city like Rome or Paris or London, it’s not easy to find outside space, but it’s so important for your lifestyle,” explains Paolo, who notes that the weather tends to be good year-round in Rome, so they get to enjoy it all the time.“We love the connection between the inside and the outside,” he continues, “and that’s why we specifically surrounded ourselves by glass – so that the outside and inside feel like the same place.”The stainless-steel kitchen and stripped-back bathroom also nod to the exterior spaces, which helps to further dissolve the boundaries between exterior and interior. “One side is tropical with bamboo and banana trees, because we had a strong connection with tropical places after travelling, and the other is classic Mediterranean with more colour,” says Paolo, admitting that both the thriving gardens are the result of Roberta’s hard work.A stone’s throw away from their home in Pigneto is the couple’s atelier, where they design their collections and have a base for their staff, in addition to their flagship in central Rome. They bought the three-storey structure five years ago and worked 24 hours a day to make it the kind of inspiring place in which they could run their company.Much like their home, the atelier is also open-plan. The double-height space with its navy-blue curtains and a TechnoD70 sofa by Osvaldo Borsani contrasts with neutral upholstery courtesy of Marco Zanuso’s Lady armchair. Jaunty abstraction is introduced by a carpet from Allegra Hicks, while huge fern clippings from Roberta’s garden once again bring the outside in.Art continues on the staircase with portraits and graphic lettering by the contemporary artists Luca Donnini, Pietro Bologna and Tommaso Modugno. It’s an extension of their home a mixture of materials and media that fuels the couple’s day-to-day work and wider existence in the city.“We’re partners in business and life,” says Paolo, before going on to reveal their plan to exercise the Italian tradition-cum-rite of decamping to the seaside, coronavirus restrictions permitting. Which does beg the question: who would want to leave a place like this?

What keeps me coming back is hopeMy daughter is here. Curled up in a hedgehog ball, but softer than anything in the universe. She is born with a quiff of thick black hair and an expression that says she’s been here before. A knowing, testing look. She is early, and small. I begin assessing my baby as if she’s one of my intensive-care patients. I check her reflexes, pupil reaction, respiratory rate and capillary refill time. Mary, the maternity support worker, watches me and laughs. “Nurses and doctors – always the worst patients.”I try not to think of all the babies, children and adults I’ve cared for who were seriously ill, but I can’t stop. I realise that when my daughter hurts, I will hurt more. And she is not hurting. She is fine. But something in me shifts. I think of all the faces of the mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles and grandparents of my patients through all my years of paediatric nursing. I try to imagine their primal pain. How could I not have appreciated the extent of it? In the most desperate of unimaginable horrors, in the face of disability, or serious illness, or pain, or loss, how do patients’ families stand upright? How do they find the courage to care?I pull my daughter closer and kiss her. She smells of honeysuckle and salt, and Plasticine when the packet is first opened, and warm bread, and blood. She is perfect. How could I imagine a love like this?“Crash call for the neonatal, adult and obstetric teams. I repeat: crash call for the neonatal, adult and obstetric teams. Accident and Emergency. Ground floor, Cavell Wing.”There’s only one explanation for why you would need three crash teams at once: a heavily pregnant woman is in trouble. The adult team is to resuscitate her the obstetrics team is to get the baby out (within five minutes, if either of them is to have any chance of survival) and the neonatal team is to try to resuscitate the newborn. Like all the other resuscitation nurses, I am on all the crash teams – adult, paediatric, neonatal, obstetric and trauma – but this crash call will also bring specialist doctors: an obstetrician, a neonatologist, an anaesthetist.Suzanne is wearing a necklace that reads Mama-To-Be. A leopard-print headscarf is holding her ombre hair back from her face. The rest of her is blood and gore and flesh and insides.There are so many people that it’s hard to know where to start, but the person in charge is a nurse with a military background: Amanda. She is one of the best nurses I have ever worked with, a reservist who has worked in field hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan. She is always calm, efficient and friendly. “Just because it’s an emergency doesn’t mean you can’t find out the names of the team, and be nice. In fact, it’s even more important in an emergency.”Amanda glances over, so that she knows I’m here whenever she needs. I start tidying up, working on the periphery.I do not see how Suzanne or her baby can survive. I focus on the drops of sweat on Amanda’s face, her eyes wildly searching for control, a plan – a way to save this woman and her baby. Or at least one of them. I try to imagine the things she has seen and experienced in her military role. I can’t think of anyone better to lead such a horrific emergency. “She needs to be in theatre as soon as we have this baby out. Like yesterday!” A doctor is on the phone, asking for flying-squad bloods. I watch the defibrillator. Amanda asks a member of the team to put the pads on Suzanne’s chest in advance of a surely imminent cardiac arrest. The obstetrician pulls the baby from her, lifts it out, wipes off the goo vigorously and places it on the Resuscitaire, for another doctor waiting there with a miniature bag-valve-mask and a stethoscope, straight to the baby’s chest. The obstetrician leaves Suzanne split open: it’s impossible to see where the blood is coming from. Large gauze squares do nothing to mop up anything. Anyone can see it’s a devastating amount to lose.There are too many people around Suzanne’s trolley. Despite the lack of room, everyone moves at speed without bumping into one another, each person perfectly choreographed by Amanda.Suzanne’s husband, Simon, is standing outside the room. I go out and stand next to him. His bottom lip is bleeding a little, where he’s bitten it. I tell him I’ll wait with him while they are helping her. But he doesn’t hear me, not really.“She’s ordered a Bugaboo pushchair and is spending her pregnancy ordering everything possible from the Boden catalogue,” he says. “I never imagined we’d end up as this couple.” He laughs a too-thin laugh. “We met in a squat.” He makes a loud noise as he exhales, as if he has no control of his breath.His face is creased with pain. “After 10 failed IVF attempts and two miscarriages, we finally felt as if this one would stick around.” He looks at me, unblinking. “She’ll lose the baby, won’t she? We’ll lose the baby. It’s too early. She was on the phone to me from the car. She was hands-free but still, she’d have been distracted.” He sobs. Covers his mouth with his hand.I don’t say anything. I don’t know yet what he’s been told, but it’s clear that I’m not the right person, and this is not the right time to give significant bad news. I’m terrified that if I open my mouth, the truth will fall out. The terrible truth is that they will probably both die. Not all babies live. Not all mothers live.We stand in silence for a while, before finally I overcome the urge to cry or say nothing at all. “Is there anyone I can call for you?”He shakes his head. Nods at the door. “She’s my everyone.”I nod. “I’ll pop back in and see how things are going.”As I go through the door again, I have to swallow down sick. I look at the scene in front of me. The staff are covered in blood, as is the floor.I focus on the baby on the Resuscitaire, grey and small, and stretched out rather than curled over, as is normal. But the neonatologist looks up at the team: he gives us the thumbs up. This baby lives. I exhale.I rush out to tell Simon.“They are working on Suzanne and she’s still critical. Everyone is doing all they can.” I pause. I don’t want him to underestimate how sick she is. But I can see that he needs something to hold on to. “Your baby is alive.”He looks at me in a kind of trance. “I’m a dad?” he asks.He is clearly so full of love. He doesn’t ask whether the baby is a boy or a girl, and nor do I. When things go this wrong, nobody gives a shit.Suzanne is somehow stable. She is placed in the high-dependency ward and her baby is on special care.I bump into Simon in the corridor two days later, rushing between the two. He is carrying a soft toy hippo. He looks like the happiest man in the world.“Suzanne slept with the hippo against her skin. The midwife said our daughter can smell her, and it’s the closest Suzanne will get to skin-to-skin for now.”“Daughter?” I am smiling.He’s crying. Happy tears. “I’m a wreck,” he says. “She’s so beautiful. Like her mum.” He holds the hippo as if it’s his baby. “I’ve turned into one of those baby bores who gets excited every time she moves.” He laughs. Then he bursts into huge, fat tears, a mixture of pain, trauma and relief. He tells me about Suzanne: how she didn’t wake up for a long time, and it was the scariest moment of his life.“We’re thinking of calling her Amanda, after the doctor who saved her mum’s life.”The adoption process is hard, as it must be. In the early stages, we were asked to list the things that led us to adopt. Miscarriage, I write. Hyperemesis gravidarum, extreme morning sickness. Advised by GP not to get pregnant again. Wanting three-year-old daughter to have a sibling as close to her as my brother is to me. Hoping to do some good? The social worker tells us that children who need to be adopted have extra special needs and there are many uncertainties, so many unknowns. But nursing has allowed me to understand that all parenting is full of uncertainties and unknowns. I have seen close up the most extreme suffering and the most extreme love.The day I bring my son home, it is my birthday. When my social worker asked if I’d like to change days, I laughed out loud. I am desperate to hold him. One night I dream about an umbilical cord that stretches the length of the country and awake with pains in my abdomen.But we are warned about a honeymoon period and things do get very hard, very quickly. He begins to get frightened. He almost seems to see things that aren’t there and hear loud noises in his head. After the initial few days, my son spends the first six months clinging to me, his fingers digging into my flesh so hard that he once draws blood.My mum visits. “What if I’m wrong for him?” I whisper, looking at my son.“Do you love him?” she asks.“So much,” I say. I lean my head on her shoulder. “I can’t even describe it.”She kisses the top of my head as if I am a child. “Then it will all fall into place. I promise.”The following week I take my daughter to her swimming lesson and the noise of the leisure centre freaks my son out so much that he bites me, hard. I yelp. A woman I recognise from the local cafe shouts across the swimming pool viewing area: “Is that the adopted one?” My son turns and listens, and I absolutely know in my bones that he understands what she has said. His face fills with tears. He does not belong. My son and I look at each other. Something shifts. “Is that the adopted one?” she shouts over again. “I see you are struggling.”And I look at my son, this virtual stranger. And he looks at me, this virtual stranger. I stand up and hold him to my body. I walk to the exit, past her, and she touches him. I feel him flinch. I flinch.I hold him closer still, with my arm around his head, away from her. And I feel his fear through my skin. I lift my head high and stare at her.“Oh, fuck off, Janet,” I say. And we go. And he relaxes. For the first time he puts his head down gently on my shoulder. He rests it so gently I can barely breathe. I kiss his head. And he lets me. In that single moment, whatever happens, he somehow knows he is OK. We both are. I am reminded so clearly of the day my daughter was born and the enormity of love that I felt. How could I feel a love like that again? Yet here it is. We are so lucky.“Michael is a 23-weeker in bed six, bay two. His dad’s in prison and his mum is in a facility needing round-the-clock care following a traumatic brain injury. Michael has had a grade-four intraventricular haemorrhage overnight and has been unstable on dopamine, and his gases are impressive. We need to put him back on the oscillator this morning. We’ve been trying to organise for his dad, Danny, to get day-release to visit.” She pauses. “He kicked the pregnant mum in the stomach, then threw her down the stairs. She landed on concrete.”Like the other nurses and student nurses sitting in the staffroom for handover, I shake my head a fraction, but carry on scribbling down the vital information. The nurse in charge pauses a beat, then carries on. She’s seen it all before. “Christie, can you look after him, please? If they agree to the visit, the dad will be accompanied by a prison officer, so we’ll need to make some room around the bed space and be conscious of the other parents.”I nod, but my knees shake. The oscillator machine, which delivers ventilation to the sickest of all babies, is a scary thing, as is caring for a premature baby with a severe bleed in his brain. But it is not those things that worry me.Kicked in the stomach and thrown down the stairs.What kind of monster does that?I pray to any god I can think of that they won’t let the man out to see his son and that I can simply concentrate on caring for Michael. He is hooked up to every machine imaginable – all big, chugging technology with him in the middle: like a full stop in the centre of a chemistry textbook. He has all the trappings of prematurity: lungs that do not yet produce enough surfactant, a gut that does not yet absorb food properly, poor reflexes, a lack of temperature control. He has suffered the worst kind of bleed to his brain. He also has retinopathy of prematurity, the eye condition that caused Stevie Wonder’s blindness. But these conditions don’t paint the picture of him. When I first meet Michael, I notice the downy hair that I recognise from caring for teenagers suffering from anorexia. His skin is almost entirely see-through, and his entire foot is the size of my thumbnail. He has a permanent frown, which makes him look like a grumpy old man, and he smells of yoghurt.“He’s the size of half a bag of sugar, but he is oh-so-mighty and has dodged death so many times that we call him ‘the mouse with nine lives’.” One of the nurses, Grainne, is giving a handover at the bedside. She has written Mighty Mouse on his whiteboard. “We shouldn’t have favourites,” she says, as if she’s talking about her own children, “but he’s mine.”She tells me his history in his short three days of life. Born addicted to crack cocaine and heroin, even in his tiny state he shows signs of foetal alcohol syndrome: characteristic facial features and a small head circumference known as microcephaly. Some children are born with the odds stacked so high against them, it’s impossible to comprehend any meaningful recovery, yet nursing has taught me that it is always a possibility. There is always hope.Michael’s “Mighty Mouse” nickname hints that he might have the will to survive. “I’ve been singing to him all night,” Grainne says. “I think my voice made him frown.” She laughs. But it’s these things that nurses do, which supposedly make no sense, that make the most sense to me.Danny is handcuffed to a prison officer and is next to Michael’s incubator when I return from breakfast at 4pm, my first break of the day. Being non-judgmental towards abusers is difficult and I’ve learned to hate and judge while keeping a poker face. I smile at him and explain the tubes and wires. “Michael’s had a very rough few days.” I tell Danny about the cardiac arrests, the bleed in his brain, the fight in him.Danny laughs at the Mighty Mouse written on the side of Michael’s chart, but he rubs it off and writes Mike Tyson instead. “Little fighter, like me,” he says.“I was born early, too.” Danny is stroking Michael’s head in the softest way possible. “A small bag of sugar.” He looks up at me. “Six foot two now.” “It’s a strange phenomenon that ex-premmies often end up so tall,” I say. We both look at Michael. He is extremely unlikely to survive.I encourage Danny to touch Michael, to talk to him and sing to him. He cracks up laughing at the suggestion of singing, but puts his hand gently underneath Michael’s miniature body and lifts him slightly as I pull the corner of his special sheet to make sure there are no creases. There is a moment, between the two of them. Michael is curled into the palm of his dad’s hand. Danny’s eyes change. It’s one of those extreme moments of love that shock us out of who we are and remind us of who we could be.I take a photo with one of the instant cameras that are always kept in the neonatal intensive care unit, for when a picture urgently needs to be taken. Usually when a baby is close to dying, I take two photos. I take one of Danny’s face, and then a closeup of Michael, curled up in Danny’s hand.It’s a short visit and when it’s time to go, I give Danny the photos. He looks at the one of Michael and he is crying. “I’ll treasure this, nurse.”And I see that he will. It does not allow me to feel pity for him, but he is no longer a monster to me. Just a weak man.“Wait,” I tell him. I disappear and come back with the camera. “Can you hold him carefully again.” Danny picks Michael up and I get the photo – almost exactly the same as the first one. Michael’s heart rate, which was much too high, falls at the touch of Danny’s hand. His father leans towards him and sings, off-key, a few lines of Danny Boy.I wonder if a man ever sang that song to Danny. If that’s how he got his name. And what kind of man he was.Like teachers, nurses can’t influence who a person becomes as much as their parents can. We cannot change the cards they are dealt. Even so, after Danny leaves, I wipe the words Mike Tyson from Michael’s whiteboard. I stick the extra photo to the top of his incubator and write at the top: Important. Please Keep, along with the date and Danny’s name. I write on the whiteboard:Michael, son of Danny and Hannah.Spring 2020. I am walking across Westminster bridge. Behind me, the Houses of Parliament are empty. In front of me, the hospital is full of people seriously ill and dying from Covid-19. The bridge is empty of cars and people, even rough sleepers. I wonder where they have gone.I walk slowly at first. I am so worried for my mum, on her own. And for my nan, shielding and in her 90s. I stop for a moment and text my children. They have grown up overnight. I am a single parent and my 15-year-old daughter, instead of going out to parties and falling in love for the first time, is offering to stay on top of her home schooling and keeping an eye on her younger brother, so I can work long days in nursing. She is planning to cook, so there is a meal waiting when I get home. I tell her she doesn’t need to do that because her adult sister – her dad’s eldest – has offered to stay to help, but she is already writing a menu. Pesto pasta features heavily.“I feel bad about not focusing on you. We ought to be together during this time,” I say at home.“Will you help people?” my daughter asks. I nod and tell them I’m rusty but that, with training and support, I’ll help the nurses, and the patients and their families. I’m planning to help for the first peak, though I have no idea how long that will last. “Do it,” she says.I stand back and look at her grinning, remembering her newly born, curled up in a hedgehog ball. How astonishing she turned out to be. I may not be feeling brave, but my children are. It is always from them that I find the courage to care. My son nods and puts on his determined expression. “You must.”Back on the bridge, I am almost running now. I think of the nurses I have worked with, these expert and compassionate people, and what they have taught me. I get to stand next to them, for a while at least. This pull of my feet and my heart and my head is older and deeper than I can describe in language. Perhaps, for me at least, this is a calling.I slow down at the entrance to the hospital and walk in, catching my breath. My colleague, Sandra, is waiting for me, wearing scrubs and carrying a spare pair for me. We haven’t seen each other for a few years, but there is no time for small talk. She hands the scrubs over and nods. “Welcome home.”• Some names and details have been changed.

For a set of solo piano pieces it’s remarkably undramatic – no great show-off moments – but it’s all so melodic, not to mention politely tricky, that it’s impossible to ignore.Most of the 11 numbers are originals, but the one that caught me first was a version of Thelonious Monk’s We See. Nothing could be further from Monk’s own rough-hewn piano technique, but when it comes to crafty turns of phrase, few have been craftier. McCormack improvises on his tune with such obvious relish that Monk would have wanted to join in.After that it was McCormack’s Shaper Maker – starting with a deceptively simple left-hand figure and getting into all kinds of mischief in just over four minutes – and I was hooked. Dream Catcher, Crystal Glass, Prospect Park (with the pianist’s phenomenal technique briefly on display): each piece is succinct enough for a reasonably musical person to follow from start to finish.

A brutal assault on their “hosts” up front after half-time completed the task and was complemented by sweeter-looking tries either side of it, one right at the death to claim the full points.London Irish, though, drift on. The resumption of activity has yet to stimulate them. This was a first match for them at The Stoop, which they will call home until they move to their new pad in Brentford in October. The rest of this season already looks as if it will prove an exercise in keeping time.They barely fired a shot throughout. The first 40 minutes, indeed, was almost without value from either side. Those who are convinced the game has lost its way have been vocal as successive teams have fumbled their way back into the swing of things. And if constantly complaining is your bag, that first half might act as the latest exhibit for the prosecution.The half-time score was 3-3, and we were lucky to get the two penalties. Actually, maybe we were not. There were 16 penalties dished out in that first half alone. The miracle is that only two of them were converted into points. Irish equalised James Grayson’s earlier penalty, when Paddy Jackson took the points on the stroke of half-time, after their attempt to drive an attacking line-out was thwarted.Irish’s limitations up front would be exposed in the second half, but here was an early hint. When they looked elsewhere for chinks in the Saints’ defence, Shaun Adendorff handled in one of the subsequent rucks, allowing Jackson to equalise, after Jack Cooke had earlier gone off his feet at a ruck for Grayson’s penalty.It is the ruck, as ever, that is causing so much of the trouble, the referees’ latest attempts to reinforce existing laws confusing the players even more than normal - or at least exposing their susceptibility to the laws of physics. All the evidence we have from history suggests that the excitability of the officials will wane after a few rounds, and normal service will be resumed.The penalties kept coming in the second half, but by then the flow was almost entirely in Northampton’s favour and the area of offence shifted towards the age-old problems for a side defending those driven line-outs. Once again, Irish were the ones confounded and were forced into conceding a penalty try, with a yellow card for Sekope Kepu, on the hour.Then the accent shifted to those problems of the undermanned scrum with the laws of physics. Time and again, and despite multiple lectures, the Exiles’ scrum was forced backwards and into infringements, so they lost yet another of their number to a yellow card (Will Goodrick-Clarke), and more ground to those laws of physics. Penalty try number two duly followed.And so Irish’s resistance, such as it was, had been broken, but they did supply the one good bit of the first half, when Ollie Hassell-Collins was released down the left, only to miss Ben Meehan with an inside ball for a likely try. The bruising youngster on the left wing was involved again in the second half with another fine run, but by then Northampton had shown themselves superior even at that running game.Their first try, 10 minutes into the second half, was scored by Tom Collins, released by some lovely handling. His chip and gather confounded the Irish cover defence, before the Saints moved on to testing the Exiles with those meatier exchanges up front. But the garnish came at the death with that bonus-point try, spectacularly finished by Ahsee Tuala.Another dour game had been salvaged - as has Northampton’s season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165499f55f9dbb1f9cdfcb48c42546cdf5d7394c/0_2_1712_1027/master/1712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5df6103d54e9d9bacae54d842808b010","title":"england v pakistan third test day two live","story":"Zak Crawley made a mighty 274 and Jos Buttler a career-best 152 before three quick wickets from Jimmy Anderson completed a perfect day for England Heard the one about the 22-year-old and the 38-year-old? With help from a 29-year-old, they have all but ensured England will win this Test. If so they will complete a 2-0 series victory - and move above Australia into second in the ICC Test Championship, a tournament we have all held dear from day one.Thanks for your company and email, please join Daniel and me in the morning to continue the countdown to Jimmy Anderson’s 600th Test wicket. Goodnight.That was a masterful new-ball spell from Anderson: 5.5-1-13-3. He’s now on 596 Test wickets, and you know what that means: two or three days of constant speculation as to whether he will retire at the end of the match if he reaches 600. I don’t think he will. Retire, that is. I think he wants to go at the end of a successful Ashes series, and if he has to play until the age of 72 then so be it. The wicket means that is the last ball of the day, because play has to finish at 7.30pm. A huge wicket for England just before the close! Anderson jags one back sharply to trap Babar in front, and Michael Gough raises the finger. Babar knew it was out and didn’t bother to review.10th over: Pakistan 24-2 (Azhar 4, Babar 11) England appeal for caught behind when Azhar shoulders arms at Archer. Richard Illingworth says no but England decide to review, probably because it’s Archer. He wasn’t particularly interested. The fielders behind the wicket thought they heard something, and replays showed they were both right and wrong. The ball brushed the elbow rather than the inside edge.9th over: Pakistan 23-2 (Azhar 4, Babar 10) “Thanks for your trip back to the 1990s earlier today,” says Peter Hanes. “Here’s another Crawley fact to ponder: two days after Zac Crawley’s birth in February 1998, John Crawley was making an epic 17 in two-and-a-half hours against West Indies in Port of Spain. Different times.”Look at Sir Curtly’s first-innings figures: 26-16-23-3!8th over: Pakistan 20-2 (Azhar 4, Babar 7) This is a good move from Joe Root, who brings Jofra Archer into the attack earlier than expected. Broad didn’t bowl badly (3-1-6-0) but it’s a good idea to give Archer a spell before the close. The first two deliveries clocked at 87mph, and the fourth bursts past Babar’s outside edge at 90mph. A superb opening over concludes with a big inswinger that beats Azhar all ends up and bounces over the stumps. Great stuff. This is Jofra. 7th over: Pakistan 18-2 (Azhar 4, Babar 7) A quiet over from Anderson six more until the close.6th over: Pakistan 17-2 (Azhar 4, Babar 6) England know Azhar Ali is an LBW candidate as he falls over to the off side. Woakes got him twice that way in the first Test, and most of his recent dismissals against England have been LBW or bowled. That’s what Broad is trying to set him up for, though it hasn’t worked yet.5th over: Pakistan 17-2 (Azhar 4, Babar 6) Babar waves Anderson elegantly down the ground for four to announce his arrival. Since Twitter announced Anderson’s retirement after the first Test of this series, he has taken five for 69 from 30 overs. I’m still not sure he should have played the last game, though that’s purely because of rotation. It shouldn’t surprise us if he’s still taking Test wickets in his forties. Jimmy Anderson takes his 595th Test wicket! Abid Ali felt for a lovely delivery in the corridor that straightened just enough to take the edge, and Sibley took a smart low catch at third slip.4th over: Pakistan 11-1 (Abid 1, Azhar 4) Broad strays onto the pads of Azhar Ali, who clips confidently through square leg for four.3rd over: Pakistan 6-1 (Abid 1, Azhar 0) The Pakistan captain Azhar Ali is the new batsman. His head must be a pretty busy place right now.He’s out! It was plumb, and that’s the eighth time Anderson has dismissed Shan in Tests. Anderson often swings the ball away from left-handers, which is pretty unusual, but this was a classical dismissal. It curved back in towards Shan, who pushed forward and couldn’t get his bat around his front pad in time. Lovely bowling.Shah has reviewed it... but it looked plumb. It was a lovely inswinger from Anderson that pinned his man in front, and Michael Gough raised the finger. I can’t see anything saving Shan here.I wouldn’t bother reviewing this one.2nd over: Pakistan 5-0 (Shan 4, Abid 1) “Did Adelaide kibosh the aggressive declaration for all future England captains,” says Niall Mullen, “or was it ever a thing?”Masood is not out! Yeah, it hit him outside the line of off stump. That was a good review from Shan and, in truth, not a great decision from Richard Illingworth. Even from 735 miles away it looked outside the line.Shan Masood has been given out LBW to Broad, but he has reviewed it. This might be outside the line, though umpire’s call is now in Broad’s favour. It was a good ball from Broad, which jagged back from round the wicket. I’m just not sure it hit Shan in line.1st over: Pakistan 3-0 (Shan 2, Abid 1) This being a day of the week, Jimmy Anderson has Shan Masood in his sights. Anderson has dismissed him sefven times in Tests, with a head-to-head average of 4.85. Shan pushes the first ball into the leg side and pegs it to the safety of the non-striker’s end. He gets another single later in the over, a relatively gentle range-finder from Anderson.There are 13 overs remaining tonight. Two down, I reckon.Ben Smith points out that, in one knock, Zak Crawley increased his Test average from 29 to 48. Pretty impressive, though not quite Laraesque. His tastic 277 at Sydney in 1992-93 boosted his average from 31 to 58.Broad misses, Shaheen hits and Joe Root walks out to signal the England declaration.155th over: England 582-7 (Bess 26, Broad 15) “Root’s declarations are always like a creepy family friend’s hug at a party,” shivers Jo Beasley. “Just goes on that little bit too long to be comfortable.”And that was before Covid.154th over: England 582-7 (Bess 26, Broad 15) Bess makes room to cut Yasir behind square for four, and then slog-sweeps the next ball heartily for six. Shot! He is a seriously good lower-order batsman, and a few bits of legitimate red ink has helped him to a fledgling Test average of 27.62. That’s only 1.35 behind Moeen Ali’s batting average, despite the obvious difference in ability.153rd over: England 569-7 (Bess 14, Broad 14) Broad carts the new Asad Shafiq for another six, this one a biggie over midwicket. It went so far outside the bubble that there’s a break in play while the umpire Michael Gough sanitises the ball. Still no sign of a declaration no idea why.152nd over: England 563-7 (Bess 14, Broad 8) Oof, Bess has been dropped by Naseem Shah off Yasir. It was an awkward skier, and Naseem was never really in position to take it as he ran back from mid-on.Now, I’ve found an example where a team of England rejects would have beaten the Test XI, or at least given them a bloody good game. No cheating, so I haven’t picked an example where a load of good players were out injured (like the fourth Test of the 1994-95 Ashes tour). The only people picked for B team are those who were (I think) available for selection at the time.Alternative team: Stewart, Gallian (Butcher would be cheating as 1996 was his breakthrough summer), Smith, Maynard, Ramprakash, Crawley, Rhodes, Caddick, Gough, Fraser, Tufnell. 151st over: England 559-7 (Bess 10, Broad 8) Broad gets off the mark by slog-sweeping Fawad for six. And why not?150th over: England 551-7 (Bess 10, Broad 0) Bess carves Yasir for four to take England to 551. Alas, exorcism fans, they are seven wickets down.149th over: England 547-7 (Bess 6, Broad 0) Fawad Alam was recalled to the Test team after an 11-year absence because he scored millions of runs in first-class cricket. Since his recall he has scored no runs and taken two wickets. He almost gets a third when Broad edges his first ball just short of slip.Woakes charges Fawad and flat-bats the ball straight to Yasir Shah in the covers. And still we wait for the declaration - but things should liven up now, because here comes Stuart Broad.148th over: England 546-6 (Woakes 40, Bess 5) Woakes cuffs Bess through midwicket for four. He has quietly moved to 40, very quietly. As with Buttler, the days of wondering where the next run is coming from are over. For now.147.2 overs: England 541-6 (Woakes 36, Bess 4) Poor Rizwan is in pain after wearing a dodgy throw from Shadab Khan on the thumb. There’s a break in play while he receives treatment, so the umpires call for drinks.147th over: England 541-6 (Woakes 36, Bess 4) A graphic on Sky shows that this is England’s first 500+ score in over three years, and also that they exceeded 500 repeatedly during their rise to world No1 in 2010-11. Andrew Strauss, the captain of that team, explains the graphic accordingly. Then, after a perfectly judged pause, Mike Atherton says drily, “That’s what’s called a humblebrag...” “‘And there were a few times when the Rejects XI would have beaten (Ray Illingworth’s selection) the first XI,’” says Henry Manuel, quoting an earlier entry. “I would love to see an example of this from you. Not that I don’t believe you but I was too young then to really understand the politics of selection.” Leave it with me it’ll be my homework tonight. If you can bear to wait that long, or haven’t completely forgotten, I’ll put it on the OBO tomorrow afternoon.146th over: England 537-6 (Woakes 33, Bess 3) No sign of a declaration yet. I’m not entirely sure what England are up to, though Andrew Goudie has a theory: “Declaration at 551-6 please!” 145th over: England 532-6 (Woakes 29, Bess 2) The difference a fortnight makes. Had Jos Buttler failed in the second innings at Old Trafford, he might never have played Test cricket again. He still had the courage to play the innings the team needed, rather than try to save his career, and produced a masterpiece that drove them to a joyously improbable victory. And now look. The ups and downs of Test cricket are endlessly fascinating.The part-timers are running riot. After Asad Shafiq dismissed Crawley, Fawad Alam has finished Jos Buttler’s brilliant innings. It was a filthy delivery, begging to be belted towards Bournemouth, but Buttler chipped it straight back to the bowler. Maybe it stopped in the pitch. Fawad won’t care - it’s his first Test wicket.144th over: England 530-5 (Buttler 152, Woakes 29) Jos Buttler kills off one good stat to create another. He waves Naseem Shah for four, his first boundary since the morning session - and one that takes him to the first 150 of his Test career! Buttler already has a score of 150 in ODIs, from 77 balls against West Indies last year. This one took 307 deliveries.143rd over: England 523-5 (Buttler 146, Woakes 28) This is now Buttler’s highest score in first-class cricket, beating the 144 he scored against Hampshire in 2010.“All of a sudden we have something I’ve never seen before in an England side - strength in depth,” says Matt Emerson. “An XI not playing here could be: Jennings, Bracey, Denly, Bairstow, Stokes, Foakes , Ali, Curran, Mahmood, Stone, Wood. And that’s without both Overtons, Malan, Leach, Rashid…”One of the sadfrustratingadmittedly hilarious things about England in the 90s is that you could often pick a strong side of those who had been left out. And there were a few times when the Rejects XI would have beaten142nd over: England 520-5 (Buttler 144, Woakes 27) Naseem Shah returns to the attack, and England continue their winding path towards 550. This is, by some distance, the longest innings of Buttler’s Test career and probably his entire professional career. Maybe there’s a part of him that wants to prove a point by being not out when England declare.141st over: England 516-5 (Buttler 143, Woakes 24) Since hitting his last boundary, Buttler has scored 32 from 101 balls. That’s with Englad pushing for a declaration. What’s he up to? What’s his angle? “Is Michael Gough a one man ‘Infallibator’?” sniffs Brian Withington. “You can review him but he never stops getting it right. Relentless.”There was a remarkable piece on Cricinfo earlier this year showing that, when it came to DRS referrals, Gough’s decision were 20 per cent more accurate than any other umpire on the elite panel. (Edit: here it is.)140th over: England 513-5 (Buttler 142, Woakes 22) Woakes top-edges a pull over the keeper for four. That’s his fourth boundary since tea Buttler continues to get ’em in singles. I do hope he’s doing this just to annoy some trolls.139th over: England 508-5 (Buttler 142, Woakes 17) “When did England last put together a partnership including a double ton and a 150?” asks Tom van der Gucht. “Was it the match whose name we dare not speak?”Thankfully not. It happened when Ben Stokes went berserk at Cape Town in 2016, with Jonny Bairstow quietly compiling an emotional 150 not out. (We sometimes forget that England almost made an Adelaide of that game as well.) I also have a vague memory of Ian Bell and KP achieving it during the run orgy of 2010-11, maybe in the final Test against India.138th over: England 503-5 (Buttler 140, Woakes 15) Woakes laces Shaheen through the covers for four, not once but twice. These two were batting together on Saturday afternoon two weeks ago, although the circumstances could barely be different. Woakes gets his third boundary of the over - and brings up the 500 - when he smears a short ball back past Shaheen.137th over: England 491-5 (Buttler 140, Woakes 3) Pakistan start the evening session with a review for caught behind against Buttler. It was a stunning low take down the leg side from Rizwan when tried to whirl Shafiq round the corner, but replays showed the only deflection was off the pad.“Just looking at those scores by England No3s,” says Malcolm Brown, “and I see that nobody has got a double century in that position more than once, except Wally Hammond, who did so six times (including a triple). He must have been good at batting.”He was better at batting than life, sadly. It’s quite a story if you’re interested, David Foot’s biography is a good place to start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9869d06b77bb8c5c87e5e9a75c4fb2ad1cc19f32/21_0_5368_3223/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3481514b26043ac8482a25222b257867","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

He has offered to provide information he says he has on the journalist\u0027s death in exchange for a pardon.A prominent businessman arrested onboard his yacht as a person of interest in the Caruana Galizia investigation\u0026nbspon 20 November 2019. One of the journalist\u0027s final investigations was a leak of data from his businesses. He has previously denied any wrongdoing. On 28 November his lawyers deposited a letter in court to Malta’s president formally asking for a pardon in return for information relating to the case. On 29 November the request was turned down.The Maltese PM\u0027s chief of staff and the tourism minister resigned on 25 and 26 November 2019 respectively. Caruana Galizia reported that they had taken control of secretive Panama shell companies soon after entering office. They deny any wrongdoing. Schembri was arrested on 26 November and released on 28 November. Police said that after an \u0027intensive investigation\u0027 they no longer felt the need to hold him.Malta’s prime minister since 2013, he has been criticised by opposition politicians for allowing Schembri and Mizzi to stay in their posts. Having said on 29 November that he would stay in the job until the investigation into the murder\u0026nbspwas complete, on 1 December in a televised address he announced that he would stay on until a new leader of his ruling Labour party was elected in January. The prime minister expressed “deep regret” for Caruana Galizia’s murder and spoke of the need for a “fresh page”.The businessman, whose interests range from hotels to casinos and a government-sponsored power project, has pleaded not guilty to charges of complicity to murder Caruana Galizia. He has also denied allegations that he conspired to bribe members of Muscat’s cabinet. Those named in connection with the allegations deny all wrongdoing.Muscat led his Labour party to a landslide victory in 2013 after two decades in opposition. His term in office was marked by both economic expansion and political scandal. The country’s property and financial services markets boomed thanks to a lucrative “golden passports” scheme – now being wound down – which allowed wealthy investors from Russia, China and the middle east to buy Maltese citizenship and easy access to the EU.The Labour leader was returned to power in June 2017 despite Caruana Galizia’s revelations that his energy minister and his chief of staff had acquired secretive shell companies soon after entering office. The journalist was assassinated in a car bombing near her home a few months later, in October 2017.Three men accused of planting the bomb were arrested shortly afterwards. Police suspected Fenech’s involvement in the case as early as 2018, when Muscat signed a warrant ordering the tapping of his phone. However, investigators did not move against the alleged mastermind until late 2019, when he was arrested at sea while sailing away from Malta on board his yacht."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c170793a57c99e5fb4e471cb5aadbb0f9e84664/0_0_6551_3929/master/6551.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=74a24ae00b1bc3e555ace47442e13c31","title":"bbc3 show famalam criticised for sketch of jamaican people","story":"Critics say comedy show also appears to invoke stereotypes of African-Caribbean menThe BBC has been criticised after it released a clip from a new series of a sketch show that appeared to invoke stereotypes about Jamaican people.The black British comedy show Famalam, whose third season is being promoted ahead of its broadcast on BBC Three on Sunday, had its latest sketch revealed on Twitter.In the clip, titled Jamaican Countdown, critics say misogynistic language is used towards one character who selects the vowels and consonants for the contestants. She is later filmed being humped by the presenter.It also suggests men of African-Caribbean descent are endowed with large penises. “When you hear the Countdown conundrum, its letters, numbers, hell of a cock, boom,” the singer behind a mock theme tune says.An actor on the show said there was a “healthy balance of sketches that banter every part of society” and that Famalam sought to “poke fun on our truths and stereotypes”.However, Paul Gilroy, the historian and founding director of the centre for the study of race and racism at University College London, tweeted: “This is what erse and inclusive BBC Three puts out in the middle of this crisis.”Kim-Marie Spence, a representative for the Global Jamaica Diaspora Council, tweeted: “This content reinforces harmful stereotypes about Jamaicans \u0026amp Black ppl – oversexed, uneducated, druggies … Famalam is offensive \u0026amp unbecoming in multicultural UK where Black Lives Matter.”But Tom Moutchi, an actor in the show, said it “played on all stereotypes” and that his castmates included people of African and Caribbean origin.“It’s only funny when it’s not you that’s the butt of the joke,” he tweeted. “The cast consist of Africans and Caribbeans. We’re not trying to single out or outrage anyone – we are just poking fun on our truths and stereotypes.”He suggested he and his castmates had experienced racist abuse after the release of the sketch, adding: “If only you knew what we go through as BLACK people in this space. Yes, spirits are high but please don’t use Famalam or the cast as scapegoats.“It’s also very weird how black people on here are campaigning for the removal of an ALL black show because you don’t like a partsectionskit … if you actually did watch the show you’d know there’s a healthy balance of sketches that banter every part of society.“I love my Africans. But they can get bantered either way. I love my Caribbeans but they can get bantered too. No one is safe. It’s comedy mate. Get a grip.”A BBC spokesperson said: “Famalam is an award-nominated sketch comedy series starring some of the UK’s best black comedy talent, which explores aspects of contemporary life from a black perspective. “Now in its third series, the show has an established brand of humour which is in line with audience expectations and is well-known for challenging stereotypes and confronting issues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64491b1cc6d4991dc11c0d3baaeb98caa9942a64/0_8_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a576cc6644859b58adbd7767f74132e","title":"covid 19 around forever former uk chief scientific adviser mark walport vaccine","story":"Prof Mark Walport says regular vaccinations are likely to be required to control coronavirus Coronavirus will be around “for ever” and people are likely to need regular vaccinations against it, a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government has said.Prof Mark Walport, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), likened the virus to influenza, as he said repeat inoculations on a global scale would almost certainly be required to control it.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme coronavirus was not “going to be a disease like smallpox which could be eradicated by vaccination”.“This is a virus that is going to be with us for ever in some form or another and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations,” he said. “So, a bit like flu, people will need revaccination at regular intervals.”The scientist said it was possible the virus could get “out of control” again, with the percentage of positive tests rising around the UK as the R number hovers between 0.9 and 1.1, but he said more targeted, localised measures could be used instead of a full lockdown.“It is this terrible balance between trying to minimise the harm to people from the infection while keeping society going,” he said. “People have argued very strongly that applying generic lockdowns isn’t the answer. Initially it had to be the case but now we can be a lot more targeted in the approach.”However, he warned draconian measures could be imposed if the virus got out of control and added it was an “enormous tragedy” that many people in care homes caught the virus and died after people were discharged from hospitals back to care while infected with coronavirus.His comments came after the head of the World Health Organization said the world should be able to rein in the pandemic within two years. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it took two years to overcome the Spanish flu in the early 20th century, but that advances in technology could allow Covid-19 to be stopped in a “shorter time”.“We have a disadvantage of globalisation, closeness, connectedness, but an advantage of better technology, so we hope to finish this pandemic before less than two years,” he said in Geneva on Friday. “Of course, with more connectedness, the virus has a better chance of spreading. But, at the same time, we have also the technology to stop it, and the knowledge to stop it.”It came as South Korea reported the most daily infections since early March and expanded social distancing measures across the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04792f4a9b813175b4e7717b1a25b8753df51d19/0_37_2436_1462/master/2436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85956cc29d5ec2a6ad4e3a3089e073be","title":"gandhis glasses sell for 260000 in uk auction","story":"Gandhi gave gold-plated glasses to vendor’s uncle who worked for BP in South Africa in 1920sA pair of gold-plated glasses worn by Mahatma Gandhi has sold in Britain for £260,000 after being found hanging in the letterbox of a Bristol auction house.“We found them just four weeks ago in our letterbox, left there by a gentleman whose uncle had been given them by Gandhi himself,” East Bristol Auctions wrote on Instagram on Friday. “An incredible result for an incredible item! Thanks to all those who bid.”Gandhi was known for giving old or unwanted pairs of spectacles to those in need or to those who had helped him. He gave the glasses to the vendor’s uncle while he was working for British Petroleum in South Africa during the 1920s or 30s, said the auction house.The sale price smashed the original estimate of about £15,000.

Mr Reid said on Saturday that 98 per cent of tests are negative and that the “vast majority would have been returned in much less than two days”.A further 79 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Friday, with no new deaths reported. It brings the total number of confirmed cases in Ireland to 27,755, with the death toll at 1,776.In Northern Ireland, another 71 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total to 6,647, the North’s department of health said on Saturday afternoon.With a week to the reopening of schools, the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) has requested a meeting with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) to outline their concerns and seek a review of advice provided to the Department of Education.Ann Piggott, president of the ASTI, said the union is receiving a “high number of communications” from teachers expressing a variety of concerns, including the safety of students and teachers in the high-risk category who have underlying illnesses.“School communities have been working hard to get schools ready for re-opening. Understandably there is much trepidation amongst teachers as they begin what will no doubt prove to be an extremely challenging school year,” she said.“The ASTI is seeking this meeting to have the concerns of teachers addressed, most especially teachers suffering from serious underlying illnesses.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillClaire Twomey’s coronavirus journey started mildly enough – and hasn’t stopped.“Initially, it was only a headache, and sinus pain last March, and I lost the sense of taste and smell. Then I spent four or five days in bed with a ferocious fever, a cough and migraines.”She attempted to go back to work, but her fever and cough worsened and she spent another four weeks in bed with a high temperature.Despite periods of apparent improvement, months later, she’s still coughing. “A trip up the stairs aggravates the cough. I go to the shops and I suffer a loss of breath.Ms Twomey is one of a large and increasing cohort of coronavirus patients who are experiencing longer-term effects of the disease. In Ireland and across the world, doctors are linking the virus to a bewildering variety of symptoms and, as time goes on, they are finding many of these are slow to resolve.Dublin GP Nuala O’Farrell describes the virus as “the imitator of all known diseases”.“Headache, dry cough and fever, we all know about. Diarrhoea, blistery lesions that look vaguely like shingles on the trunk, chilblains, chest pain, tachycardia, arrhythmias, pericarditis (swelling of heart tissue) and of course elderly people who are just ‘not themselves’, can all be symptoms of Covid.”Rollercoaster rideA number of her patients have been on a rollercoaster ride of symptoms since contracting the disease. “One woman went from doing spinning classes four times a week to, two weeks after testing positive, being hardly able to walk up the stairs. Her head was splitting, she had no sense of taste or smell and every bone in her body was aching. Eight weeks on, she is only beginning to recover.”Ms Twomey, too, has found that being fit provided little protection against the disease. “I did yoga, I ran. Now if I try to do anything, I have to take to the bed for four or five hours. I have aches in my arms and legs. I’ve gastro issues, and tingling sensations on my skin.”“When we say that the vast majority of people have a mild illness and recover that is true,” says Dr Mike Ryan, the World Health Organisation’s head of emergencies. “But what we cannot say at the moment is what are the potential long-term impacts of having had that infection.“We hope that everybody who recovers from Covid-19 will make a full and permanent recovery but there are enough people out there having difficulties with their exercise tolerance, having difficulties with their breathing and potentially having long-term impacts on their cardiovascular system.”International findings dovetail with the experiences of some Irish patients. One international study suggested 10 to 15 per cent of people, including some mild cases, do not enjoy a quick recovery. In Italy, 87 per cent of one group of patients who had been hospitalised were still struggling two months later.It remains too early in this novel pandemic to say how long patients’ symptoms will endure, and whether the virus will give rise to chronic disease.The ergence in patients’ symptoms is driven by the varying way the virus attacks the body, often leading to inflammation and blood clotting as well as respiratory ailments.Notable too is the number of patients who say they were previously fit and healthy but are now having lasting problems, as well as “up and down” nature of many patients’ recoveries.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is proving remarkably adept at disrupting many areas of activity in the body. It uses a spike protein to attach itself onto cells’ ACE2 receptors, found in the lungs, heart, gut, kidneys, blood vessels and nervous system. Often, the damage is done as much by the overweening inflammatory reaction of the body as to the original infection.“We still don’t know what we’re grappling with in terms of the long-term cardiac manifestations,” says consultant cardiologist Dr Crochan O’Sullivan. “The interaction between the virus and the ACE2 enzyme triggers its entry into cells in the body.”Stroke is a particular risk linked to coronavirus given the role of the virus in making patients more susceptible to blood clotting.Ms Twomey says what really exhausts her is having to deal with three or four issues at the same time. “The fatigue is like nothing I’ve ever experienced in my life. It’s like a crash.”Her yo-yo experience of the disease prompts her to remark that “my recovery is worse than the initial experience”.Along with her parents, who also tested positive for the virus, she attends the Mater post-coronavirus clinic in Dublin. “They’ve been great,” she says, “but there’s only so much they can do. They still don’t know the answers”.Dr Killian Hurley is a respiratory consultant at Beaumont Hospital, where he heads up a post-coronavirus clinic, and the RSCI. Over the last six months the clinic, which takes referrals only from patients who were hospitalised, has seen more than 100 patients.Severe fatigueThe clinic provides patients with access to specialists from a variety of disciplines including respiratory medicine, intensive care, infectious diseases, psychology and psychiatry.Dr Hurley says patients come with a wide variety of lasting symptoms, including continuous shortness of breath, cough, severe fatigue, anxiety and other mental health issues.Some of those who spent periods in intensive care are suffering a form of post-traumatic stress disorder, he says.Many have lung problems months after their disease experience. “They still have abnormalities on their chest X-rays there’s scarring there, particularly among those who were in intensive care.”For a small group, even walking a short distance after six months causes them difficulties. Generally Dr Hurley finds that the more severe their illness was, the more severe are their continuing after-effects.“This is a totally new disease. We don’t have 40 years of research into this. My sense is, though, that it will be a mild disease for many, with a good chance of eventual recovery.”However, many patients are “terrified”, he acknowledges, and “frightened about what the future might hold”.Stressing the need to identify problems early, he says the health service needs to be proactive in following through with patients in a standardised way.This is difficult when only 50 to 75 per cent of health service capacity is available due to coronavirus restrictions, and while the system is continuing to battle new infections.He says his “hope” is that the residual problems of most patients will resolve over the space of a year, as happened with other respiratory syndromes.Ms Twomey has set up an online support group for coronavirus survivors, which now has more than 400 members.The Facebook group is providing a forum for discussion, sharing of experiences and guidance.Suffering“People feel they don’t have answers to their questions. They’re frustrated because there isn’t one place for them to go to seek those answers,” she says.Many people suffering symptoms, including those who were never tested because their symptoms didn’t meet the criteria in place at the time, and those whose tests came back negative, are not eligible to attend the clinics and so have to plot inidual recovery journeys.But in mid-April she developed fatigue and nausea. One day she “couldn’t get out of bed”.Because she had only one of the symptoms required at the time to be sent for testing, she never got a diagnosis.She says her condition worsened, as she developed shortness of breath and heart palpitations, “brain fog” and loss of memory.“It came that I couldn’t remember the right word to use in a situation. Or I would be looking at words and not recognising them, or saying the wrong word,” she says.Eventually she got a test, but to her distress it came back negative.Still her condition did not improve. “I used to run or walk 15km a day, but now I couldn’t leave the house. I’d have a couple of good days, and think things were fabulous for a week. And then the next day, it would hit me like a train again.”Still suffering from a “rollercoaster of symptoms” after 16 weeks, she had to stop working and tending her garden. “I’ve had relapse after relapse. It’s the uncertainty and the not knowing that is so hard to take, not being able to live a normal life and the impact on your mental health.”She realises others have it worse but wonders how long her symptoms will persist.“I don’t think I can cope with another six months of this. People don’t understand how long term this can be, and the damage that can be done.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dublin-Belfast service \u0026lsquohad higher than anticipated demand\u0026rsquo, company saysWoman is first prisoner to test positive for coronavirus in the RepublicHundreds attend event which passes off largely peacefullyOne third of people surveyed say they gained weight, as one fifth worry about food suppliesCompletion from test referral to contact tracing now taking 2.1 days \u0026ndash HSEPolice across district self-isolating and will be tested, says senior commanderBelfast court told that MI5 were involved in PSNI investigationBid underway to replace 175-year-old monkey puzzle tree which fell in Cork during stormAccused ordered to surrender his passport, sign on daily and keep a curfew while on bailEstimated 25,000 Hindus living in Ireland, says director of Vedic Hindu Cultural CentreShannon Heritage had warned heritage sites would close in less than two weeksMartin says new Covid-19 law will target businesses \u0026lsquoendangering public health\u0026rsquo rather than house partiesAs patients report longer-term effects, it remains too early to say how long symptoms will lastPoliticians would be unwise to underestimate level of public anger about revelationsHandling of crisis has transformed view, from \u0026lsquopale, male and stale\u0026rsquoJohn Mullan (49), children Tom\u0026aacutes (14) and Amelia (6) die but mother Geraldine survivesInternal study for first time details force\u0026rsquos relationship with ethnic minoritiesSinn F\u0026eacutein leader says event, attended by more than 80 people, was \u0026lsquothe last straw\u0026rsquoCounty\u0026rsquos lockdown extended as cases are \u0026lsquostill high\u0026rsquo, but schools to reopen as plannedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336759.1598120253!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus who says world could rein in pandemic in less than two years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA doctor checks the breathing of a patient in the intensive care unit dedicated to Covid-19 at the Ineram Hospital in Asuncion, Paraguay. Photograph: Jorge Saenz AP PhotoThe world should be able to rein in the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years, the World Health Organisation has said, as South Korea reported the most daily infections since early March and expanded social distancing measures across the country.The WHO’s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said technology could help end the spread.By “utilising the available tools to the maximum and hoping that we can have additional tools like vaccines, I think we can finish it in a shorter time than the 1918 flu”, he said.The WHO also recommended that children over 12 use masks in the same situations as adults as the use of face coverings increases to stop the virus spread.In fresh guidelines developed in co-operation with Unicef it said children should wear “a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area”.South KoreaThe advice came as South Korea reported 332 new cases on Saturday, including 315 local infections. The figure is the highest since March 8th, when it recorded 367 infections.All of the country’s 17 major cities and provinces reported cases for the first time since January, Yonhap news agency reported.It said stricter social distancing rules would be imposed outside the greater Seoul area, from Sunday.The government had previously raised social distancing rules in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi province to level two in the three-tier system.Karaoke bars, clubs and computer cafes were ordered to close and Sunday church services have been banned.South AfricaSouth Africa’s Covid-19 infections passed 600,000 on Friday, although the number of new cases has been declining since a peak in July.Despite imposing one of the world’s toughest lockdowns at the end of March, when the country had only a few hundred cases, South Africa saw a surge in coronavirus infections that has left it the hardest hit on the continent.The government eased lockdown restrictions this week to allow most of the economy to re-open. But president Cyril Ramaphosa cautioned that cases could surge if people failed to maintain vigilance.The health ministry said in a statement South Africa now had a total of 603,338 cases and 12,843 deaths - accounting for more than half of the continent’s cases and around 47 per cent of its deaths.ItalyItaly’s health ministry on Saturday reported 1,071 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, exceeding 1,000 cases in a day for the first time since May when the government eased rigid lockdown measures.Italy, one of Europe’s worst-hit countries with more than 35,000 deaths, has managed to contain the outbreak after a peak in deaths and cases between March and April.However, it has seen a steady increase in infections over the last month, with experts blaming holidays and night life for causing people to gather in numbers.The country last recorded a higher figure on May 12, when 1,402 cases were reported, six days before restaurants, bars and shops were allowed to reopen after a 10-week lockdown.Despite the rise in infections, daily death tallies remain low and are often in single figures. Saturday saw just three fatalities, compared to nine on Friday and six on Thursday, health ministry data showed.On Saturday, Lazio, around Rome, was the Italian region to see the largest number of new cases, with 215.Of these, around 60 per cent were people returning from holidays in other parts of Italy and abroad, the region’s health chief said.The northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, where Italy’s epidemic first came to light on February 21st, saw 185 and 160 new cases respectively.Spain, France and GermanyIn Spain’s capital Madrid, officials recommended people in the most affected areas stay at home to help curb the spread as the country registered more than 8,000 new cases in 24 hours. The figure was a 1,000-case jump on the previous day.France reported 4,500 new cases on Friday, the second consecutive day of more than 4,000 new infections - numbers not seen since May – with metropolitan areas accounting for most of those infections.Germany reported 2,034 cases on Saturday, its highest daily cases since 25 April. In other coronavirus developments:Global cases of coronavirus stood at 22.8 million, and deaths at 797,000.The UKThe United Kingdom recorded 1,288 new positive cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, up from 1,033 a day earlier, government figures showed.Eighteen people died after testing positive for the coronavirus within 28 days, up from two a day earlier.The new cases were recorded as the British government ramps up testing so it can suppress the spread of the virus and ease restrictions that have crippled the economy.Travellers from France to the UK will be required to self-certify that they are not suffering coronavirus symptoms or have been in contact with a confirmed case within 14 days preceding travel, the British government said on Friday.Brazil and MexicoBrazil reported 30,355 new cases of the coronavirus and 1,054 deaths, the health ministry said on Friday.Despite this, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual press conference that there was a “clear downward trend in many parts of Brazil”.The country has recorded nearly 6,900 deaths and more than 290,000 cases in the last seven days, according to the UN health agency: “The acceleration of cases has stabilised but there’s still a very high number of cases and a large number of deaths,” Mr Ryan said.“Credit to the health workers and the communities in Brazil for taking the necessary actions to stabilise the situation,” he said.“We’re in that difficult period in Brazil where it looks like things could be getting better. The question is: is this a lull, can this be continued and can we see that downward trend?”Brazil has more than 3.5 million cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, while the official death toll is more than 113,00.Mexico’s health ministry on Friday reported 5,928 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and 504 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 549,734 cases and 59,610 deaths.\u0026nbsp– , ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

EPARonald WittekCoronavirus cases have been reported by at least 41 schools in Berlin, barely two weeks after the German capital’s 825 schools reopened.Cases are rising across Europe, including in Spain, which registered 66,905 in the past two weeks, resulting in the continent’s highest 14-day infection rate and warnings over the risk of a new wave of deaths.The Berlin experience echoes that in some states in the US, including Georgia, and in Israel, which have recorded clusters tied to schools. According to reports in Berlin, all age groups have been affected, including in elementary schools, high schools and trade schools.Berlin was one of the first places in Germany to reopen its schools after the summer holidays. Children are obliged to wear face coverings in the hallways, during breaks and when they enter the classroom, but they can take them off once they sit in their places and classes begin.Some critics say the measures in Berlin are too relaxed and both students and teachers should be wearing face coverings during lessons.The situation in Spain has drawn a grim warning from the country’s health emergency chief, Fernando Simón, who told reporters: “There should be no confusion: things are not going well. If we continue to allow transmission to rise, even if most cases are mild, we will end up with many in hospital, many in intensive care and many deaths.”More than a quarter of these new infections have been in Madrid, which was at the centre of the country’s crisis in March and April.“We can’t say that the epidemic is out of control at a national level, but there are some specific places where it is,” Mr Simón added, without giving further details.Deaths have also increased across Spain, with 131 dead in the last seven days compared with 12 one month ago. About 1,400 Covid-19 patients were admitted to hospital in the last week, nearly double the figure a week earlier.The rise in cases has prompted officials across Spain to roll out a series of measures, including asking regions to order the closure of brothels, a week after the government shut most nightlife establishments and imposed various other restrictions.France, meanwhile, has recorded another large jump in new coronavirus cases, by far the highest increase since the end of the lockdown in May, leading authorities to order schoolchildren above the age of 11 to wear face coverings when they return to school in just over a week in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus.The new policy marks a toughening of measures as coronavirus infections pick up pace in France, with 4,700 new cases reported on Thursday, a post-lockdown record.“Use of masks will be systematic inside from middle school and not only where there is no social distancing. But outdoors, it’s a local decision,” the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said in a TV interview late on Thursday.The French health ministry reported 23 additional deaths and 4,586 new infections over the past 24 hours on Friday. There are currently 266 clusters under investigation, and 31 French departments are deemed to be in a situation of “moderate or significant risk”.Health experts say the increase in the number of new cases cannot be explained by the widespread testing being carried out as the rise in new cases is significantly higher than the rise in the number of tests. Hospital and intensive care admissions remain stable, say authorities.-  News and Media Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Saudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust plans better manage carbon impact visits","story":"The National Trust is planning to discourage visitors from making lengthy journeys to its country properties, according to a briefing document seen by the .Under the proposals, the trust is seeking to “reduce journey times and increase non-car access” to its vast portfolio of stately homes and gardens. In doing so it hopes to “better manage the carbon impact of visiting”.The document said there will come a need for a “shift from a reliance on days out to more flexible community use”.The plans, contained in a 14-page briefing document entitled “Towards a 10-year vision for places and experiences”, will raise eyebrows amongst some of the National Trust’s most loyal members for whom a day out by car to a country property is one of its great joys.Written by Tony Berry, the heritage charity’s visitor experience director, the document was drawn up in response to the lockdown which it says has accelerated “some tricky choices” for the National Trust over “which activities to stop, start and continue”.The National Trust, which has six million members, is proposing 1,200 redundancies to make up for the financial shortfall caused by the pandemic. It employs 15,000 staff and 70,000 volunteers across its huge estate of historic houses and castles. It is not clear how the Trust could achieve more localised visits when so many of its properties are away from urban centres in rural areas hard to reach without a car.It complains that “its current visitor model puts a disproportionate load on peak times” and that the “outdated mansion experience” largely serves “a loyal but (by 2030) dwindling audience”.Mr Berry instead promotes a new vision over the next decade by “building long-term, deep and sustainable relationships with people who live close by. That will allow us to better manage the carbon impact of visiting, by reducing journey times and increasing non-car access”. Critics of the National Trust’s current management will raise concerns that the charity plans to raise more money by increasingly hiring out stately homes for “specialised experiences”.The charity has been accused in recent years of ‘dumbing down’ and under its current proposals to save money its national specialists in areas including textiles, furniture and libraries face redundancy.Dr Amy Boyington, an architectural historian said: “This again feeds in to the whole ‘dumbing down’ of history within the NT, where it believes that to be accessible to everyone it needs to make history flashy, punchy and Disney-esque.”Dan Hicks, author and curator at Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, said: “As well as just houses and gardens, the National Trust cares for nationally significant collections of objects, archives, photographs, and more – so the prospect of losing expert librarians, archaeologists and curators is deeply worrying.”In a statement, the National Trust said: “The Trust document on a vision for places and experiences was an internal discussion document to look at possible ways forward as we emerge from the coronavirus crisis. It is not a strategy.“We remain committed to, and passionate about, the country house and arts and heritage. And we will not dumb down.We will always welcome the enthusiasts and the specialists and provide them with experiences that are tailored for their interests, such as at places like Kingston Lacy and Petworth – where we ensure those treasure houses are presented to the highest possible standard.“But we also want to ensure there is something for everyone in our houses, taking visitors from their first encounters with our heritage and onto discovering ever-greater treasures from different houses. “We accept that the presentation of some of our houses can be improved and we need to make sure they are meaningful and relevant for the 21st century. We want to move away from a one-size-fits all model and to focus on the ersity of our places and ensure we make the most of our collections.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wont people run thenational trust trust nation","story":"The National Trust: could an organisation want a better name? To be national and to be trusted is the ambition of every major British charity, institution, business and political party*. Since its foundation in 1895, the National Trust has, on the whole, lived up to its name. It is the most successful heritage organisation in the world. That is why it has more than 600,000 acres and nearly six million members.It is interesting to recall the trust’s full name. It is The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. This title links buildings with gardens, landscapes and coastline. Whenever people within the Trust have tried to break that link, there has been trouble. Whenever they have strengthened it, there has been success.Historically, there has always been a tension between what a great former supporter, Sir John Smith, called “the Lilies and the Boots”. The Lilies were the aesthete curators who cared about the collections and fabric of the more than 200 historic houses. The Boots were the land agents who wanted to make the estates work and preferred the great outdoors.This tension was usually more creative than destructive. The relationship between what is built by man and what is grown by harnessing nature is a glory of the British landscape. The National Trust has maintained this relationship, and sometimes improved it. That is what ensures its appeal to people of all classes and widely differing tastes. Members understand that it is all one thing – what Beatrix Potter, inventor of Peter Rabbit and Tom Kitten, called “a noble thing”. Because she believed this, she bequeathed the trust 4,000 acres of the Lake District. Its current headquarters is called Heelis – her married name – in her honour.But in recent years, something else has entered the fray. Now Covid-19 has brought it out into the open.This week, two documents have found their way into the public domain. The first, from the NT director, Hilary McGrady, introduced a “consultation” on the “Reset Programme”. In plainer English, she means job cuts. The trust is losing £200 million this year, caused, she says, by the coronavirus.There is the usual patter about bioersity and carbon footprint, ersity and inclusion, “community”, Equality Impact Assessments, “unconscious bias” and “how the collections came to be” (which I take to be a coded reference to the profits of slavery). But in essence, the paper is lists and charts of lost jobs and new ways of working, mainly by centralisation. Food, for example, will come from “Whole Trust Delivery Teams”, not from the land and gardens the trust owns.Although the curators – the trust’s unique knowledge bank – will be cut by less than some areas, their expertise will diminish. Instead of being experts on one big thing, such as paintings, furniture, or textiles, they will be allocated to cover everything in a single century. This makes no sense when great houses have usually developed architecturally, and in their collections, over centuries. Blickling Hall, in Norfolk, for example, is Tudor, Jacobean and 18th century, with 19th-century alterations as well.Behind Ms McGrady’s 41 pages lies an implied admission that the trust has overreached, nearly doubling over ten years. It has been the Cecil Rhodes of heritage colonialism, grabbing too much, too fast. Now it has suffered a non-fatal but worrying cardiac arrest.The other document is called “Towards a 10-year Vision for Places and Experiences. Version 2.1”. It is written by Tony Berry, the Trust’s Director of Visitor Experience. The first thing to note about the Berry plan is its visuals. There are pictures of children building sandcastles, a family travelling in a driverless car playing with screens through a futuristic urban landscape, robots, wheelchairs, and a mock-up of the Houses of Parliament being flooded by global warming. Nowhere is there an identifiable picture of a trust property. There is no photograph of a trust house at all.That last point is presumably intended, since Mr Berry says that the “outdated mansion experience” has to go. He wants “revolution”, not “evolution”. Out goes the “asset-led approach (our primary role is to present the English country house as a distinctive part of our heritage).” In comes the “audience-led approach”: houses should no longer be presented as “country house former homes” but “repurposed as public space in service of local audiences”. “Everywhere… we will move away from our narrow focus on family and art history.”As for gardens, they will not just be beautiful places of tranquillity and “heritage”, but places of activity “where issues like climate change are acknowledged and tackled”. Perhaps some ingenious horticulturalist like the chap who produced the loganberry should develop a fruit called the berryberry in honour of Tony and his visitor experiences. It would be green at all times, and run through one’s system with frightening speed.If Mr Berry’s ideas were to be pursued, several things would happen. First the donor families, many of whom inhabit part of their former house, or a house on the estate, would rebel. If their gift was being “repurposed as public space”, why should they continue, as many do, to lend its contents to the trust, or, on death, to transfer them to it as “acceptance in lieu” of tax, instead of selling them on the open market?Second, the Berry vision might break the great National Trust Act of Parliament of 1937 specifically designed to rescue country houses for the nation. It would also call into question the unique privilege granted to the trust by its original Act of Parliament of 1907, which states that no property once given to the trust can be taken away from it except by the will of Parliament. Why should the trust be allowed to keep buildings whose historic interest it disregards?Finally, National Trust members are usually fascinated by the family stories in its properties, as part of the human dimension and historical context. They do not see most of the properties as neutral backcloths for entertainment, let alone for lectures about the environment. They like their romance and their narrative. Mr Berry loves using the word “narratives”. He says people are searching for “narratives to define their own identities”. Yet he never mentions the great common historical, social and geographical identity in all these places – the word “Britain”.It should, in fairness, be said that the gleam in Mr Berry’s eye is not the agreed policy of the National Trust. Ms McGrady has hurried to point this out. But his views are not untypical of those who talk of “visitor experience” and “interpretation”, yet seem actively to dislike the real experience of a place with a history – a history which, all too often, they seem proud not to know.This is a problem much more widespread than the National Trust – a problem in schools and universities and parts of the public services and the BBC. It is a culture – or rather a lack of culture – which needs to change.Here is the full sentence from Beatrix Potter from which I quoted earlier. “The Trust,” she said, “is a noble thing, and humanly speaking – immortal. There are some silly mortals connected with it but they will pass.”*Footnote: The National Trust covers the whole of the UK except for Scotland. The Scottish National Trust is a separate (and much less secure) body.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kremlin critic alexei navalny arrives berlin emergency treatment","story":"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is being treated in a Berlin hospital for a suspected poisoning, after landing in Germany on Saturday morning on an emergency flight from Siberia.Supporters believe Mr Navalny - a prominent critic of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president - was poisoned, a claim disputed by Russian medical officials.Accompanied by his wife Yulia Navalnaya, Mr Navalny was transferred by air ambulance from Omsk in Siberia and landed in Berlin’s Tegel Airport at 8:30am on Saturday morning, German media reported.He was later transferred to the Berlin’s Charité Hospital, Germany’s largest university clinic.  Mr Navalny is currently in an induced coma and breathing through a ventilator. Doctors have described his condition as ‘stable’, according to local reports.Russian doctors dispute any evidence of poisoning, instead saying Mr Navalny was admitted to hospital suffering from a ‘metabolic disorder’.  Navalny fell ill and lost consciousness on a Moscow-bound flight from Tomsk, where he is believed to have consumed a poisoned cup of tea in the Siberian city’s airport. The plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Omsk, in southwestern Siberia.The Omsk Ministry of Health put out a statement late on Saturday saying no toxins were found in Mr Navalny\u0027s system, besides alcohol and caffeine.Following tests, we can say with certainty that no oxybutyrates, barbiturates, strychnine, or synthetic poisons were found. Alcohol and caffeine were found in urine samples,” a statement read.Mr Navalny\u0027s spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh rejected earlier reports that he had been drinking the day before he was hospitalised. The regional ministry said it stood ready to cooperate with foreign doctors or provide other assistance.On Saturday afternoon, doctors at Berlin’s Charité Hospital said Mr Navalny was undergoing a series of ‘extensive’ tests.  “An extensive medical diagnosis is currently being carried out. After completing the examinations and after consulting the family, the treating doctors will comment on the disease and further treatment steps,” the Charité University Medical Centre said on Saturday.The examinations will take some time.Mr Navalny\u0027s allies have said they feared authorities in Russia might try to cover up clues as to how he fell ill.The doctors in Omsk said on Saturday they were ready to share all information they have with the German clinic.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is believed to have been a prominent supporter behind the move to bring Mr Navalny to Germany.Late on Saturday, German president Frank-Walter Steinemeier said he was “relieved” that Mr Navalny was being treated in a hospital and by doctors who enjoy the trust of the family.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, called for an investigation into his illness.Mr Raab tweeted: “Relieved that Alexei Navalny has been flown to Germany to receive the critical medical treatment that he needs. I wish him a swift recovery. It is vital that there is a full and transparent investigation into his poisoning.”Russian doctors initially opposed any attempt to relocate Mr Navalny, saying the patient was too ill to be transported. They later relented after German doctors said his health condition should not prevent the transfer.The deputy head physician of the Omsk clinic, Anatoly Kalinichenko, disputed the earlier opposition to Mr Navalny’s transportation, saying: We have no objection to a transfer to another hospital.Yesterday morning, Ms Yarmysh confirmed on Twitter that Mr Navalny had boarded a plane in Siberia and would be heading to the German capital.Many thanks to everyone for their support. The struggle for Alexei\u0027s life and health is just beginning and there is a long way to go, but at least the first step has been taken, she said.Mrs Navalnya thanked his supporters, writing on Instagram: Without your support, we wouldn\u0027t have been able to take him!Mr Navalny was flown to Berlin by German NGO Cinema For Peace, with Russian authorities giving permission for the dissident’s transfer late on Friday.The NGO was responsible for a similar transfer by ambulance plane from Moscow to Berlin in 2018 of Kremlin critic Pyotr Verilov, a member of protest punk band Pussy Riot. Verilov also suffered from a suspected poisoning.Mr Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin\u0027s side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters.He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and rallies and sued over his investigations into corruption. He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new zealands lust lockdown latest example vapid political virtue","story":"Progressive mythology always demands a socialist valhalla a nation to be idealised and held as up an inspiration. For years, Scandinavia, and particularly Sweden, played this role. The stereotype was never entirely accurate Scandinavian social democracy is a far cry from full-throated socialism, yet it remained influential.In the face of the pandemic, however, the tables have turned now it is the libertarian Right who are lining up to applaud Swedish exceptionalism, while progressives liken their controversial strategy to a form of eugenics. With Sweden consigned to the naughty step, the Left needs a new country to fetishise, and they have alighted on New Zealand.This was underway long before the virus arrived, thanks to NZ’s intoxicating combination of centre-left politics and a charismatic, young and importantly, female, leader: Jacinda Ardern. Her decisive leadership following the mass shooting in Christchurch propelled the New Zealand PM to global prominence, and she has since enjoyed fawning media coverage surpassing even the high water-mark of Trudeau-mania.The Left applauded NZ’s “wellbeing budget”, emphasising citizens’ happiness over GDP growth, and cheered when Ardern brought her baby into the UN assembly hall. Their zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been especially influential. A group of weak-minded MPs and peers are currently urging our own Government to pursue a similar aim of total eradication.We should be under no illusion - this is no model for New Zealand to follow, let alone a sophisticated global economy like ours. NZ may have contained the virus, for now at least, registering the lowest mortality rates in the OECD, but it has taken genuinely draconian policies and great economic pain to get there. The Ardern administration is eliminating rights on a scale more reminiscent of authoritarian China than a Western liberal democracy.Last week, the whole of Auckland was sent into lockdown after the government announced a grand total of four new cases in the capital. GDP has taken its biggest slide in three decades. A total ban on foreign arrivals has endured for months, with catastrophic results for tourism, directly employing 8.4 per cent of the workforce. New Zealanders returning from abroad must pay for the privilege of isolating in military-guarded facilities, to the tune of more than £1,500 per head. One man recently received a six-week jail sentence for hugging a friend quarantining in a detention centre.The NZ experience should serve as a cautionary tale about the normalisation of overreach. Though the country has not recorded a single covid death since May, the government decided to postpone the Autumn elections following the small-scale outbreak this month. Progressives, so alert to the subversion of democracy in the USA, had little to say about this extraordinary over-reaction.An elimination strategy has made them hostages to fortune with precedence established, it will be politically toxic to change course. Ardern has ridden high in the polls so far, but if such disruption continues, public appetite for keeping the country virus-free at any cost will surely wane, and the recent outbreak, despite NZ’s geographic isolation and its draconian policy response, suggests no country can postpone the inevitable.The implications of New Zealand’s autarchy go beyond its shores as well. Tourism accounts for a third of jobs in Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu and two thirds of their visitors come from Australia and New Zealand. Yet amid mounting poverty and unemployment, island leaders’ pleadings for air bridges seem barely to have registered with an administration myopically focused on elimination. In seeking to be kind, the Ardern administration has ended up being very cruel indeed.Enthusiasts for this model imply that elimination, like the happiness budget, and like Ardern herself, puts people above the callous vicissitudes of the balance sheet. As we are increasingly finding, the two cannot be so easily disentangled. Excessively harsh lockdowns have become a form of international virtue-signalling something only wealthy nations can afford, but which promises catastrophe for the world’s poorest.Before the recent spike, commentators lauded Ardern as being “on course to eradicate the virus completely.” The ambition was childish and hubristic in the extreme. Until the planet reaches a state of elimination, New Zealand will have to stay in indefinite isolation, with domestic lock-downs a likely fixture of life, perhaps for years to come.

They have called on the Government to crack down on these products as part of its new anti-obesity drive to get Britain fit.Groups such as Action on Sugar and the Early Years Foundation have warned that the National Food Strategy risks is being undermined by the sale of snacks and sweets such as Percy Pig and Bear Pure Fruit Yoyos, which they say are full of harmful sugar.The groups spoke out following the publication of the strategy, which calls for free school meals for an additional 1.5 million children in a household on Universal Credit, and for poorer youngsters to be fed during the school holidays.The 110-page report – the first independent review of UK food policy for 75 years – said obesity was a national emergency we can no longer afford to ignore and that the coronavirus pandemic had given a new urgency to the slow-motion disaster of the British diet.Health campaigners said parents who want to do the best for their children are being tricked into buying fruit-based snacks that are in fact high in sugar.Holly Gabriel, a nutritionist at Action on Sugar, told The : It is highly concerning that many people, especially parents, are often tricked into choosing these fruit-based snacks thinking they are choosing healthier products, only to find these items are high in free sugars, and with minimal nutritional value. Claims on packs such as \u0027No added colours\u0027 and \u0027one of your five a day\u0027 mislead parents that these are a suitable snack, with many stating: \u0027Great for kids.\u0027 Whilst it should be mandatory for these products to be included in reformulation programmes, it is essential that the upcoming labelling reviews in the UK results in changes to these practises.Along with the many other health impacts of excessive free sugar consumption, these snacks are contributing to tooth decay in children and should be classed as confectionary and not healthy snacks.As well as Percy Pig sweets, sold by M\u0026ampS, Action on Sugar and the Dental Wellness Trust also highlighted a number of other supposedly healthy snacks which they described as harmful. These include Graze Super Snackers Strawberry, Fruit Bowl Yogurt Raisins and Bear Pure Fruit Yoyos Strawberry, which they say are high in sugar.Graze is promoted as high in fibre. Real fruit. No artificial sweeteners, colours, flavours or preservatives. These bars have 50 per cent less sugar than the average cereal bar and with a recipe made with help from kids. Less sugar, top taste.Fruit Bowl\u0027s Yogurt Raisins are marketed as ideal as a snack. Irresistible, intensely fruity, and incredibly moreish. Fruit made fun. Yummy, yummy yogurt coated raisins.June O\u0027Sullivan, the CEO of the London Early Years Foundation, said: It\u0027s already a struggle for parents to fully understand what is \u0027healthy\u0027 without food manufacturers confusing matters further with misleading claims and snacks packed full of sugar which are marketed heavily towards children.At a time when nearly 40 per cent of all London\u0027s children are overweight or affected by obesity, and the highest rates occur in the areas of greatest deprivation, this is highly irresponsible behaviour.Dr Saul Konviser, of the Dental Wellness Trust, said: Added sugar has found its way into almost all food, and the use of sugar as a means to calm, entertain, or reward children has become normalised, whereas in fact it does quite the opposite and so sugar should be an occasional treat.Aside from the well-known health problems of obesity and diabetes, the widespread availability of sugar leads to much toothache and suffering, not just in children but in adults too.Graze defended its Super Snackers range as delicious wholegrain oat bars that are all under 100 kcals with 50 per cent less sugar than the average cereal bar.A spokesman said: All three recipes contain less than 3g sugar per bar.  The reason we add some sugar is not only to create great tasting products but it\u0027s also really important for binding and texture in baked goods. As a brand we strongly believe \u0027natural\u0027 is the best policy when it comes to health and when it comes to sugar. We would never permit any artificial sweeteners in any of our products to achieve lower sugar levels, like some other brands do.Golden syrup and liquid sugar are types of sucrose sugar, much like cane sugar, and help us give our cereal bars a great taste and texture. We also add dried fruit into the mix for natural sweetness. We\u0027ve managed lower sugar content in our kids\u0027 product by replacing sugar with naturally sweet chicory root fibre.We also want to be clear that we do not advertise or promote these products to children, in accordance with the Unilever principles on marketing to children.Fruit Bowl said: Fruit Bowl Yogurt Raisins are clearly positioned differently in the market to Fruit Bowl\u0027s wider range, which the brand communicates through the packaging design and the language on pack.  Yogurt Raisins are clearly marked as a \u0027yummy treat\u0027 on front of pack, rather than an everyday snack. While Fruit Bowl Yogurt Raisins contain real fruit and no added colours or flavours, we make no claims such as high fibre or one of a child\u0027s five a day on this range.Henry Dimbleby, the founder of the Leon restaurant chain and author of the Government\u0027s National Food Strategy, took particular aim at M\u0026ampS for its Percy Pig sweets, marketed as containing all natural fruit juice and sold at child- height in stores despite the first four ingredients listed being forms of sugar, such as fructose syrup and glucose-fructose syrup.Mr Dimbleby said part of the problem was that well-meaning parents were giving children unhealthy snacks such as raisins which were clothed in a veneer of goodness and actually may be no better for you than a Mars Bar.An M\u0026ampS spokesman said: All our products have clear labelling so that customers can make informed choices about what they buy. All our Percy Pigs are made with natural fruit juices and no artificial colours or flavourings, and last year we also introduced a range of Percy Pigs with one third less sugar.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"report shows covid 19 case across europe numbers tracking raising","story":"A new report from Europe’s main health agency shows Covid-19 case numbers are tracking up, raising the possibility of an impending second wave for Europe.Infection rates across the continent rose continuously for the 31 days to August 19 and reached 37 per 100,000 people in the EUEAA and the UK.The trend has continued, if not worsened, over the last week.The figures, released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), add to growing concern over a resurgence of coronavirus.Reporting on week 33 of the pandemic, the ECDC found 18 countries reported significant increases in the number of positive cases.This included the UK as well as Austria, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.Although part of the increase was linked to increased testing, the proportion of positive tests have been increasing in France, Netherlands, Slovenia and Greece. In total, had a weekly test positivity of 3 per cent or higher.Data for hospitalisations and deaths is more encouraging but not stable.“Hospital andor ICU occupancies andor new admissions due to Covid-19 have recently increased in Bulgaria, Czechia, Greece, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. No other increases have been observed, although data availability varies”, the report said.“Increases in the 14-day Covid-19 death notification rates compared to those reported seven days ago have been observed in two countries (Belgium and Romania)..”While the increasing number of cases is not yet reflected by an increase in deaths across Europe, experts warn this could change as transmission among the young works its way through the population.Spain could offer confirmation, reporting an uptick in deaths in recent days.Authorities in Madrid on Friday advised residents in areas with a high level of coronavirus cases to stay at home as it logged 1,199 infections in 24 hours.The new outbreak is beginning to threaten the health system, with three Madrid hospitals announcing this week that they are starting to cancel operations.Unlike Spain, France and Croatia, Greece so far has avoided being added to the UK’s quarantine red list.Despite this, Greece recorded its highest ever number of cases in one day on August 14, with local lockdowns reintroduced in several areas.Greek tourism chiefs have pleaded with the UK Government not to add the country to the quarantine red list, as it seeks to boost its economy with bookings.British holidaymakers returning from Croatia have this weekend vented their anger at the sudden change in quarantine rules.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced on Thursday that travellers returning to the UK from Croatia after 4am on Saturday would have to quarantine for 14 days.Passengers arriving at Heathrow Airport after Saturday\u0027s early morning deadline spoke of having no time to travel back from the country ahead of the deadline.France, Germany and Italy meanwhile all saw their biggest daily rise in cases since the spring this week.The number of new coronavirus infections in Germany topped 2,000 in the past 24 hours, a high not seen since the end of April.Italy reported 1,071 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Saturday, exceeding 1,000 cases in a day for the first time since May.Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, urged people to act on health advice on Saturday after official data showed 2,328 new cases in the past 24 hours.Please help doctors, be careful. We really did not have the first wave (of infections) when it happened in Europe. Now it is coming.Seasonal factors could influence the evolution of the current Covid‐19 pandemic - meaning the situation could worsen as we move into colder months.Experts have predicted human-to-human transmission of the virus will become more widespread in winter.One study estimated that for every one per cent drop in relative humidity, confirmed Covid-19 cases increased by seven to eight per cent.In Britain it was announced on Friday that the R rate may now exceed one - the point at which cases start to grow exponentially - for the first time since the first peak.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/19/15/gettyimages-597561960.jpg  width= 1460  height= 1095  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/19/15/gettyimages-597561960.jpg","title":"britney spears father jamie conservatorship extended","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Spears ‘strongly opposes’ father’s position as conservatorBritney Spears’ father Jamie will retain control of her personal life, career and estate, despite the singer having requested that he be removed as her conservator.Spears’ conservatorship has been extended until at least February 2021, a judge determined in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday (19 August).Spears’ father has been her conservator for 12 years. Conservatorship is when a  or protector is appointed by a court to manage the life of someone due to physical or mental limitations. Spears’ conservatorship was put in place in 2008 after she suffered a public breakdown in 2007.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn Monday (17 August), Spears’ lawyers had stated that the singer is “strongly opposed” to having her father as her conservator.The conservatorship has been the subject of widespread online protests this year.The #FreeBritney movement was launched by fans who believe Spears is “trapped”, and one petition, with more than 100,000 signatures lobbying for Spears’ freedom, claims: “Her father doesn’t allow her to drive, all of her calls \u0026amp messages are monitored, she’s not allowed to vote, hang with anyone or spend her money without permission. And if she breaks a ‘rule’ he threatens to have her kids taken away.”Earlier this month, Jamie called the #FreeBritney campaign “a joke” and said he is tired of rumours that she is being exploited.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Andy BurnhamThe restrictions currently imposed on Greater Manchester to limit the spread of the virus are working and driving down case numbers - the region’s metro mayor Andy Burnham has said.Greater Manchester was among a number of north western provinces to have limits placed on gatherings of more than one household in August - a widespread local lockdown that fell short of the stringent restrictions place on Leicester in late June.However despite concern over a spike of infections in Oldham, where residents have been told not to socialise outside of their household, Mr Burnham has said numbers are beginning to “move in the right direction”.He told the BBC: I think we are beginning to see the numbers move in the right direction and that includes Oldham, which saw a noticeable fall in the number of cases this week, and we have begun to see falls in other Greater Manchester boroughs as well.We had the restrictions introduced about three weeks ago and I would say we have begun to see these restrictions are now working, so fingers crossed we can see more boroughs released from these measures soon.But on the whole we think it was right to put these restrictions in and hopefully people can see now they were put in for a good reason.German cases reach high not seen since AprilGermany has reported 2,034 new cases of the virus across a daily period - marking the first time the nation’s infection number has exceeded 2,000 since the end of April amid rising figures across Europe.The nation’s Robert Koch Institute called fresh outbreaks - reported in settings including nursing homes, hospitals, and schools very concerning. \u0026nbspA spokesperson added cases were also being seen “among travelers and in the context of religious or family events.Rising Italian daily case figure\u0026nbspexceeds 1,000 for first time since MayItaly’s case number across a 24 hour period has exceeded 1,000 for the first time since May when the government first began to ease its lockdown measures.The first European nation to have been severely impacted by the virus, Italy’s health ministry reported 1,071 positive infections had been confirmed across the time period.Italy has largely managed to contain its outbreak following a peak in March and April that led to the nation’s overall death toll of more than 35,000.\u0026nbspDespite rising case numbers fatalities remain low - with three deaths reported on Saturday, compared to nine on Friday and six on Thursday.Scientists put on a show to test spread of virus at gigsResearchers in Germany have put on a concert to assess how good the virus is at spreading at gigs.\u0026nbspThe show in Leipzig was attended by around 1,500 people, who were packed in to watch German pop signer Tim Bendzko perform.\u0026nbspHowever unlike the shows of the pre-Covid era, each volunteer attendee was equipped with contract tracing technology to map their route around the arena and track the path of potential virus-carrying aerosol particles as the talked and mingled.Fluorescent disinfectants were also used to highlight which surfaces at the mock concert were touched most frequently.We really had a lot of fun, Mr Bendzko said. We survived drive-in concerts this summer and in that respect, for us this is a first step toward normalcy.To mitigate the actual potential to spread the virus each attendee was tested for the virus ahead of time, and all were made to wear protective masks throughout the test.Stefan Moritz, who led the study, said despite turnout being lower than had been hoped researchers had been able to acquire “good quality data”. The results of the test are expected in the next four to six weeks.\u0026nbspDeaths top 800,000 worldwide\u0026nbspCoronavirus has taken 800,000 lives around the world, according to a John Hopkins University tally, and has been found to have infected close to 23 million people.China has been giving experimental coronavirus vaccines to high-risk groups since July, official saysWhile no vaccine has yet passed final, large-scale trials to prove it is safe and effective enough to protect people from coronavirus, China has been providing high-risk groups with jabs since July, a senior National Health Commission official has told state TV.The aim is to boost the immunity of specific groups of people, including medical workers and those who work at food markets and in the transportation and service sectors, Zheng Zhongwei said.Authorities could consider modestly expanding the emergency use programme to try to prevent possible outbreaks during the autumn and winter, added Mr Zheng, who directs the team\u0026nbspcoordinating\u0026nbspstate resources for coronavirus vaccine development.The guidelines for emergency use of potential coronavirus vaccines, approved on 24 June 24 according to Mr Zheng, have not been made public.The state-backed\u0026nbspGlobal Times reported in June that China had been offering candidate coronavirus vaccines to employees at state-owned firms travelling overseas.Italy records largest surge in new infections since MayItaly has recorded more than 1,000 new cases for the first time since mid-May, when the country was still in lockdown.“There is continued talk of a second wave of the virus, but in fact the first wave is actually not over yet,’’ health ministry consultant Walter Ricciardi said on Friday.“We knew that easing measures would have consequences.’’UK cases rise by 1,288The UK\u0026nbsprecorded another four-figure surge in new cases today, up from 1,033 a day earlier, government figures show.Eighteen people died within 28 days of having tested\u0026nbsppositive for the virus, after two deaths recorded the previous day.Six more people die with virus in England\u0026nbspA further six people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospitals to 29,496, NHS England has said.The patients were aged between 79 and 93, and all had known underlying health conditions.Another four deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result.\u0027They should never have let us go abroad\u0027: Holidaymakers describe \u0027near-on impossible\u0027 bid to reach UK before quarantine deadline\u0026nbspKaren Emery, 57, who works in a school, and her sister Dionne, from Newcastle, were due to fly back from Dubrovnik on Sunday, but had to cut their holiday short in a bid to avoid quarantine measures,\u0026nbspembarking on a near-on impossible journey back to the UK as a result.We had to get an overnight ferry from Croatia to Italy before flying to Heathrow, which was near-on impossible, it\u0027s not like coming back from France, there\u0027s no way out in time, Ms Emery told the PA news agency at Heathrow Airport.They should have given us until Monday, so we could plan a way out, but there wasn\u0027t enough time, so our holiday has been cut short.They should have never let us go abroad, it\u0027s a disgrace, we knew this could happen but there was no support, no advice from the government, we were pretty much forgotten about, we were all on our own.China approves human testing for potential vaccine cultivated inside insect cellsChina has approved human testing for a potential coronavirus vaccine cultivated within insect cells, Chengdu city officials have\u0026nbspsaid.Using insect cells to grow proteins for the vaccine - a first in China - could speed up large-scale production, the city government of Chengdu said in a notice on WeChat.The vaccine developed by Chengdu\u0027s Sichuan University has received approval from the National Medical Products Administration to enter a clinical trial, the notice said, having been found to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in monkeys with no obvious side-effects.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Home Office says it provides successful applicants with only a digital copy of their status to ensure they can “constantly access proof of their status” and that it is in keeping with the “shift towards digital status in all areas of life”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, charities warn that this will exclude people who are not digitally literate and that some agencies – such as landlords, employers and border officials – may continue to demand physical proof of status, which would leave millions of people cut off from their fundamental rights such as access to employment, healthcare and housing.A review into the scheme by the Government Digital Service in 2018 found the digital-only system would cause low digital users “a lot of issues”, with some unlikely to be able to use the online service “at all”. It said the Home Office’s drive to convert more services to digital and remove their physical counterparts needed “careful consideration”, warning that “digital by default doesn’t mean 100 per cent digital”.Nicoletta Peddis, 34, an Italian national who has lived in the UK for 12 years, faced a week-long delay in the process of renting a new property in York with her partner last year because the letting agent insisted that they show physical proof of their UK residency. The agent said it had “no idea” what EU settled status was when she explained that it was digital-only.“In the end, she managed to check it online, but I’m worried this might cause more problems down the line. It’s a signal of how complicated things could get next year.”She added: “The letting market in York is crazy. I thought, if someone else had applied who didn’t have this problem, they might just go with them rather than us, just because it’s easier and you don’t have to go through all these checks.“It would be so much easier if they provided a document. Things like the Windrush scandal make you think this is not going to go down well.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said I was an EU citizen and she said ‘but Brexit’. I said I had EU settled status and tried to explain that there was a way to check it online.“She was getting more and more confused. It was stressful, I thought I was going to miss my flight. And then eventually, she let me through.”Without physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe 24-year-old said she would prefer to have a physical document, particularly when travelling: “I think people in a lot of countries are aware of Brexit but they don’t know when it’s happening, what it means and how it works. It would be so much easier if there was some kind of card or stamp in my passport that I could show to avoid these kinds of conversations.“The whole idea of records only being kept online doesn’t sit well with me, especially after the Windrush scandal.”Another Lithuanian national, who has been in the UK for 13 years, and asked not to be named, was prevented from visiting her mother in Russia because the Russian embassy refused to access the link to her EU settled status online.The 40-year-old woman, who works as a private tour guide, said: “I took a screen grab and they didn’t accept it. They said other EU nationals had shown them their physical residency permit. I told them I didn’t have any paper documents. I tried to explain how it works but they said no, we can’t click on anything. They said they needed a paper proof of residency.“It’s very disappointing because the last time I saw my mother was last September. She’s 70 and she lives on her own. I’m very angry and frustrated. I don’t deserve this, I haven’t done anything wrong, I have every right to be here, but now all of a sudden I feel like I have no rights.“There should be physical proof – ID cards or something. It can’t go on like this, how many more problems will I and others face in the future?”Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million campaign group, warned that these cases were “only the tip of the iceberg”.“From next year, millions of EU citizens who are doing key work in their communities, in fields, warehouses and offices, will be treated differently from the rest of UK residents. They will have no tangible proof of their hard-earned right to live and work in the UK,” she said.EU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rightsGovernment denies Verhofstadt claim over EU citizens’ right to remainEU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rights“EU citizens will face a crisis that is entirely preventable: being unable to open a bank account if the website is down, or lose out on a job because there was no phone signal and the next person in line had a physical card to prove their right to work there and then.“While the world inevitably becomes more digital, we need to make sure that those who struggle or face problems do not fall through the cracks in the meantime. The government should give EU citizens physical proof of their right to live and work in the UK.”Ollie Persey, a barrister at the Public Law Project, said the charity was concerned about the impact of digital-only status for disadvantaged groups, including elderly people who are not digitally literate and people who cannot access their digital status because of their disability.Describing a recent case in which the charity was asked to assist a client whose visual impairment meant that he couldn’t read screens, Mr Persey added: “Without physical documentation, people in this situation will face real difficulties in proving their immigration status next year.”  Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said: “From the outset of the EU settlement scheme, countless organisations and iniduals have raised concerns about a ‘digital only’ status. “Iniduals are already experiencing problems within the UK as a result of this. It is unclear what steps have been taken to ensure that border officials in other countries understand what the digital status is, but this is another example of the problems caused by the lack of a physical document.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens are our friends and neighbours and we want them to stay – which is why we are delighted that there have been more than 3.5 million grants of status under the scheme.“In the long term, physical documents expire, become invalid, or can be lost, stolen or tampered with. A digital status ensures that EU citizens who are granted status in the UK can constantly access proof of their status, which is just as valid as a physical one.“All areas of life are seeing a shift towards digital status, from banking to transport – it is only logical that borders and immigration embrace technology and continue with this shift.“EU citizens can, however, continue to use their passport or national identity card to evidence their status in the UK until 30 June 2021.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Mark warned: “This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations.“So a bit like flu, people will need revaccination at regular intervals,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Oldham and Blackburn under new lockdown restrictions – liveCoronavirus puts travel agency STA Travel UK out of businessWHO chief says he hopes pandemic can be ended in less than two yearsCoronavirus tests should be compulsory for students, say scientistsProfessor Ara Darzi, a former Labour health minister and co-director of Imperial College London’s Institute of Global Health Innovation, said regular home testing could be the UK’s “best hope” against the pandemic.But he suggested the number of tests carried out in the UK may need to be increased to “one million or even 10 million a day”.Mass testing could give the public confidence the disease is under control, he suggested. “And unlike a vaccine, which is still many months away, simple, easy and cheap tests, some based on saliva, with results in as little as 10 minutes, are already out there,” he wrote in The Daily Prof Darzi is currently overseeing a study of home testing, involving more than 100,000 people. It has found nine in 10 home tests are carried out correctly.But the testing process would have to be simplified so people could self-test daily, he added.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a moment that had been a long, long time coming, and when it did Kamala Harris grasped it with both hands.On a night freighted with history, the senator from California officially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be vice president, the first woman of colour thus selected by a major party, and only the sixth woman in total in the US ever added to a ticket.In a speech that spread over more 15 minutes, and perhaps representing the de facto keynote address on the third night of the convention despite top billing going to Barack Obama, her words were at once warm and hopeful, yet firm. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe paid respect to the political pioneers that had gone before her, breaking the ground that would help allow a black American woman of South Asian heritage, build a career such as hers. And she paid tribute to her family, particularly her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US at the age of 18, and raised Kamala and her sister after their parents orced. She died in 2009. Ms Harris said that when her mother gave birth to her, aged just 25, at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, she may have struggled to see just what lay in store for her daughter.DNC 2020“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America,” she said. Ever since Joe Biden indicated in March of this year that were he to secure the nomination he would choose a woman as his running mate, there had been widespread anticipation he would select a woman of colour. Such a strategy appeared all the more vital and fair, following the killing by police in Minneapolis of an unarmed black man, triggering protests for racial justice that swept not just across the US, but around the world.In selecting the 55-year-old former prosecutor, Mr Biden said his main priority had been to find someone who could step into the job on day one, not merely a sound bite for a 77-year-old man, who will be the nation’s oldest president by far should he defeat Donald Trump in November.In her comments, Ms Harris noted that this week marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment, which gave some women – white women – the right to vote.“So many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred,” she said. “Without fanfare or recognition, they organised, testified, rallied, marched, and fought—not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on.”She named several female civil rights and political leaders — “Mary Church Terrell and Mary Mcleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm”. Ms Chisholm was both the first black congresswoman and the first black woman to make a run for the White House, back in 1972.“We’re not often taught their stories,” she added. “But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.”Trump’s strategy for dealing with the DNC is about to backfireMichelle Obama to hail Biden’s ‘grit and passion’ Why I can’t shake my disgust about being forced to vote for BidenMichelle Obama’s keynote speech at DNC expected to be major hitHer comments followed by an equally impassioned and hard-edged address by Mr Obama, who probably for the first time in four years in public, criticised Mr Trump by name. He said he feared for the state of the nation’s democracy should he secure a second term.“I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr Obama. “But he never did.“If Mr Obama’s speech was heavy, and sombre, Ms Harris was able to inject a fair degree of energy into her words. Joe Biden will be relying on this verve to drive his campaign in the final three months, across a country beset by anxiety, economic hardship and the challenge of combatting the coronavirus pandemic. “Years from now, this moment will have passed,” said Ms Harris.  “And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re gonna ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? And we will tell them, not just how we felt – we will tell them what we did.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In fact, I wonderin some ways we’ve ever had it so good.In football, the Leeds, West Brom and Fulham fans among us have the precious memories of heart-stopping promotion moments to cherish for ever.Similarly, while Liverpool fans would have preferred to have partied with their team, none of them will ever forget the evening Cha did them a favour and the title was theirs. And the intensity of Watford and Bournemouth fans’ misery at relegation will have been no less keenly felt without them being present.In fact, let’s be honest, under the circumstances they might well have been far better off at home anyway.Whether we were there or not turns out not to have mattered quite as much as we thought it would.Watching at home, we even got used to the crowd noise sound-effects. They seemed like the daftest idea ever at first, but so skilfully was it done that I was quite at home with it by the end of the season.I’ve loved the cricket too. I can’t tell you how much I normally enjoy being there for these matches, they’re the greatest joy of the sporting summer. Hordes of inebriated, sunburnt fans howling on their teams, whether I’m one of them, or watching at home, are all part of it. But watching the West Indies and Pakistan Test series unfold even without the mayhem of the crowds has been wonderful.Will, for example, Chris Woakes’ performance in the first Pakistan Test live any less long in our fondest memories for having been played out behind closed doors  Will Chris himself be any less delighted with it  Will his grandchildren care as he rocks them on his knee and tells them about his four fabulous days at Old Trafford in the weird summer of  Actually, you could forgive Chris for not being desperate to have crowds coming back. He played out of his skin behind closed doors in Manchester, and saw his football team, Aston Villa, save themselves from relegation in another deserted stadium days earlier.As for the snooker, pandemic or not, spectators in or out or a bit of both, we were still captivated.As it happens, I watched the Fulham v Brentford play-off final, and some of the snooker, in a sports bar in a hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia, while an absolutely apocalyptic electric storm raged outside. I sat there with a handful of other Brits, riveted to the screens even as the roof of the place proved unequal to the task of keeping out the rain. What I can only describe as a waterfall soon started cascading into the middle of this bar. And yet we watched on, intently, as teams of Croatian hotel staff rushed around us with mops, buckets and a big kind of water Hoover thing. Nothing could tear us away. Even when something fused and it all went dark, we just filed on to the terrace and watched the storm with one eye, while with the other we watched data from the snooker and football flash up on our phones. Pandemics, floods and whatever  — bring on the plague of locusts — nothing, but nothing, can stop the sport getting to us, and us getting engaged with the sport.And nothing, ever, can stop Ronnie O’Sullivan being Ronnie. First he said the players were being treated like lab rats, then he said a lot of his fellow lab rats were hopeless snooker players anyway. And then he goes and wins the thing. You can’t keep a good bad mad man down, can you Why has sport still managed to grab us by the scruff of our necks in these troubled times  I think there are three reasons: Firstly, we missed it so much when it wasn’t there at all.

I can excuse the caution of Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson deciding it was better to be safe than sorry in the early days of an unknown pandemic.But as the weeks turned into months and Generation Corona effectively lost a school year, I will never forgive the militant teaching unions for keeping them shut regardless of the social cost.It was a partisan play designed to damage a Tory government at a time when politics should not have mattered one iota.Unfortunately, the A-levels mess this week was depressingly inevitable from the moment the school gates slammed shut.A knee-jerk decision to cancel all exams without waiting to seethere was a way they could be sat in a socially distanced manner meant the current crisis was unavoidable.This situation CANNOT ever be repeated — but I’m fearful it’s already happening.Coronavirus is now being used as an excuse not to provide anything slightly dficult or complicated in all areas of our lives.But when it comes to education, the costs of that lazy caution are too great.I don’t know about you, but much of the development I experienced at school was down to my social interactions and extracurricular activities, rather than solely what was taught on the blackboard.Yet many schools are intending to use Covid- to justy axing breakfast and after-school clubs, banning music lessons and school productions, and stopping sports.It breaks my heart to see these opportunities indefinitely wrested from our youngsters with no scientic evidence to back up why.But it is being caused by a desire from adults to avoid ato normality.A King’s College London study this week revealed a majority of the public are supportive of our nightmarish “new normal”, with  per cent believing employees should be able to keep working at home until a vaccine is discovered and administered.This is cloud cuckoo land thinking. While the progress in Russia and at Oxford University looks positive, there is no guarantee we are going to have a vaccine at all.  So here’s an unpleasant newsflash: Covid is going to be part of our lives for many years. After all, smallpox is the only infectious disease to ever have been eradicated.Selfish adults can ruin their own lives by giving in to irrational hysteria, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy the fair education of our kids.The fightback against militant education unions, box-ticking bureaucrats and cruel social distancing regulations for students must begin today.MUCH media attention this past week has been focused on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s dubious claim that London cops are institutionally racist because they pulled over her and a black mate, even though they were driving in a vehicle with tinted windows, meaning the officers had NO IDEA of their colour.What’s far more disturbing is the release of new figures showing violent assaults on Met officers have increased by  per cent in the past three months, coinciding with a period of social unrest sparked by coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests.Our police are under attack from all angles.They are filmed by baying members of the public desperate to show discrimination but unable to release their own body cam footage.They are accused of racism simply for arresting criminals.Andwe’re not careful, they will give up trying to stop many crimes because the potential repercussions aren’t worth it.DISTURBING news for celebrity lovers: The stars you probably think are nice are usually utter horrors in real le and those with bad reputations publicly are often delightful off camera.That’s my experience after two decades reporting on the entertainment industry both here and in Hollywood.So I’m fascinated to see a celebrity not being nice is now an offence that can see them be “cancelled”, becausethat goes on, there won’t be many left on the telly.This week, in one of the biggest celebrity reporting injustices I’ve ever seen, Nadia Sawalha was hit by claims she is nasty behind the scenes.Believe me, I saw it all over ten years working at ITV Daytime, but can vouch that the Loose Women star is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met in the toxic world of showbiz.To suggest she is some sort of fake is beyond the pale.Nadia is adored by everyone backstage, her best friend is one of the broadcaster’s make-up artists, and she cares deeply about the folk she works with.While some TV stars don’t know the names of crew members they’ve worked with for years, Nadia befriends most of them.The vulnerable, self-deprecating, caring and honest-to-a-fault list you see on Loose is the real woman I know and adore.FIRST the US broadcaster HBO axed Gone With The Wind, before introducing a so-called “trigger warning” to the start of the classic film.Now it has sparked further outrage by doing the same thing to the Mel Brooks classic Blazing Saddles.If this woke attack on our culture continues, soon virtually every old film favourite will come with a sombre introduction by a liberal university professor outlining the social ills you’re about to witness.That got me thinking about what will end up being said before my three favourite films of all time :Grease: Contains ious examples of toxic masculinity, with Kenickie inappropriately invoking rape culture when he asks DannySandy “put up a fight”.The Wizard Of Oz: The scarecrow uses make-up to change the colour of his skin in an early example of blackface.The Sound Of Music: Glamorises a handsome young Nazi soldier called Rolf and features emotional abuse by the captain of his children, including the use of a whistle for discipline.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Office for National Statistics data showed footfall at all retail locations is up to  per cent from a low of around ten per cent in early April.Shopping centres and High Streets are back to  per cent of last years levels of visitors.Ninety-three per cent of businesses are back open. Seventy-seven per cent of firms said there was no risk or a low risk they could go bust.Goods vehicles are once again clocking up their usual mileage. And overall road traffic is just nine per cent lower than before lockdown.Tonight, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “It’s great to see people back out and about, using our roads to boost business and drive our economic recovery.Sun readers will be happy to see that we’re setting out plans to spend £billion on improving our roads — reducing congestion, pollution and journey times. And we aim to cut through red tape and get projects done faster.”But while many drivers are getting back on the roads, commuters are still shunning trains and buses.Train passenger numbers are only at  per cent of last year’s levels. And bus usage is at just  per cent of what it was.In London, where millions of office staff are still working from home, Tube passenger numbers are  per cent the level of last year. The capital’s buses are only  per cent full.A third said lockdown had not aff­ected their turnover for this year. But half said they had seen a decrease.Just one in eight of the workforce remains on furlough.Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out to Help Out Scheme to boost restaurants, cafes and pubs was used  million times last week. Data up to Monday of this week showed road traffic just nine per cent lower than the equivalent Monday in February. Britain’s White Van drivers are back to  per cent of pre-Covid- rates.ONS senior statistician Chloe Gibbs said: “Road traffic data shows the number of car journeys is ing to normal levels as people venture out to shops and travel to work.”But many huge firms are still telling workers to stay home and it is having a major knock-on effect on rail, Tube and bus commuter numbers and the wider urban economy.It is a huge blow for cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester. Their centres became ghost towns during lockdown.Cafe chains including Pret a Manger have announced job cuts as a result of having fewer customers.Rail usage has slumped to  per cent of last year’s levels, the Tube at  per cent and buses at  per cent.NEWS that Britain is bouncing back to normality is music to our ears.Last month, behavioural scientists worried that nervous Brits might let the economy tank rather than come out of hibernation. But they underestimated our resilience: High streets up and down the country are bustling once again . . . and ever-dependable White Van Man is back out on the road.We caution, though, against getting lulled into a  sense of security.New ONS data reveals that a whopping  per cent of employees are STILL on furlough, proving the extent to which the job retention scheme continues to prop up the economy.As the scheme tapers off, it’s inevitable that thousands of hardworking and blameless employees will be let go.We’re concerned too about the future of offices — and the cleaners, shop owners and transport workers who depend on their survival for work.On the Continent, the vast majority of city workers are back behind desks. But in the UK, business districts are ghosttowns as white collar employees find they like the work-from-home lestyle.It would be churlish not to celebrate today’s good news. But celebration must be tempered with pragmatism: The scarring effects of lockdown will be felt for months,not years, to come.For a full recovery, we must all make a concerted effort to shore up the economy by going out to work, pubs and the shops.  Tonight Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith warned: “Office workers, civil servants, those in big companies are really being shown up by the self-employed and small businesses who are all getting back to work and are thus helping the economy.“Its down to these businesses and their office workers to recognise their responsibility, and get back to the office so they can help all the smaller businesses, the cafes, restaurants and bars in the centre of our towns and cities, so they are able to prosper again.”A No spokesman said: “This data shows our economy and society have reopened successfully — and it is hugely encouraging this has happened without a resurgence in the virus.”WE all faced tough times during lockdown and only when it was right did Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the green light for our shops to reopen.But customers have stayed away in droves, leaving the retail landscape looking like a series of ghost towns.Figures from the Office for National Statistics estimate that around , people in England currently have the coronavirus — less than . per cent of a population of around million.And while our neighbours in Europe have flocked backed to their offices, we’ve been more wary over here.Around  per cent of French white-collar workers are back at their desks,  per cent of Italians and  per cent of Germans.Here, it is just  per cent.That has a knock-on for those city centre businesses that rely on those workers for trade, such as sandwich shops and dry cleaners. Not forgetting trains and buses that ferry workers around.Already the job losses are piling up, with Marks  Spencer announcing it is shedding , staff over the next three months.I fear it could get a lot worse with many more thousands of jobs lost across the High Street.Pre-Covid, there was the hustle and bustle of happy shoppers thronging the stores while office workers were spending in their breaks.It breaks my heart to know that shoppers are staying away in their millions and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, with countless businesses being brought to their knees.But it’s not just down to the public, we need action right from the very top of government.People need to have their confidence boosted, and while everyone appreciates we are in unprecedented times and it is tough, it is also the responsibility of the Government to show the way back, just like our counterparts have done in EuropeWe need support for entrepreneurs with low rents in new or abandoned units. And councils could use their compulsory purchase powers to turn empty buildings into places where businesses can thrive once more with good, safe public transport.Add to that safe cycling, rent “holidays” and flexible-term agreements to help get businesses back on their feet.So come on shoppers, shop and office workers, let’s get our High Streets and city centres buzzing again.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has scrapped caps on student numbers but many universities are still grappling with finding enough space for the number of kids who met the terms of their offers. Universities admissions body UCAS found that an extra , students now have the grades to get into their first choice uni.Ms Donelan said in a letter to vice-chancellors: “Where possible, try to prioritise those from disadvantaged backgrounds for admission this year.”The failed algorithm for deciding A-level grades was ditched earlier this week in a massive Government U-turn, meaning more students met their university offers. But universities are concerned about litigious middle-class parents who might take up legal actiontheir kids dont get a place and have to take a gap year, according to The Times.Watchdog The Office for Students has backed the move to give priority to poorer school leavers. Chief exec Nicola Dandrige said:“While it is for universities to make inidual admissions decisions, students from disadvantaged backgrounds must not be allowed to slip through the net as admissions decisions are made.”But one admissions head has said universities may not follow the instruction, which does not set out how disadvantaged should be defined. There is a range of criteria normally relied on to decide who is from a deprived background - including those who lived in particular areas or attended schools where fewer people go onto higher education, as well as those from low-income families or ethnic minority backgrounds.The admissions head said: “In hard choices like these they would normally look at GCSE grades or parts of the personal statement. “I fear that many may already feel they have met their targets for disadvantaged children getting into university this year so have done enough.”Head of the Higher Education Policy Institute Nick Hillman, said it was not a simple decision. He said “If I was a vice-chancellor, or running admissions, I would worry that the wording is open to all sorts of challenges, even legal ones.“Do they have sufficiently robust information to make that fine judgment  Is it based on parents’ salaries, or ethnicity, or other characteristics  It is open to interpretation. How do you satisfy this without opening yourself up to potential legal challenges  No one is against giving an extra leg-up to people from very under-represented groups but there are a lot of litigious middle-class families out there and schools are very keen to ensure their progression rates are good this year.”Head of UCAS, Clare Marchant told BBC Radio  it was the right thing to do to prioritise poorer kids who are less likely to be able to take a gap year. She said: “I think it is absolutely the right intention. I think we know from all of our survey work that those from most disadvantaged backgrounds really, really worry about money. And sothey are deferred for a year, or asked to defer for a year, we’re likely to see a drop-off. And so that’s the real intent behind that.She added: “I think what I would say is that universities are very inidual, they make inidual decisions, but all of them, having spoke to a number of them at Universities UK over the course of the last days and weeks, are looking to be as super flexible — they want students to come to them.”The Office for Students is fighting off demands from campaigners that disadvantaged children should be given compensationthey have to take a gap year. Durham University has gone a step further to free up places and tried to convinced students to take a gap year by offering them a bursary.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I went back on the Sunday as I had forgotten a couple of bits and they had actually added more trousers for p in dferent sizes.Joanna ed home with  pairs of trousers for her daughter and two sons - aged six, nine and  - plus four more for her nephew.She said full price the haul would have cost her £, but she bagged them for just £.. Joanna added: I shouldnt have to buy any for quite a few years now. Trousers for my eldest usually cost about £ a pair so they were an absolute bargain.The school kitchen assistant posted about her find on Facebook and her friends were just as gobsmacked.Joanna said: A lot of my friends were actually annoyed that I hadn’t called them to tell them. I rang my sister in law and I got a few pairs for my nephew. I bought  pairs in total.What shocked me the most when I went in the next day was that they had added even more pairs. The first day there were none for younger boys but there were loads when I went back.Joanna bought the school trousers from Asdas Stevenage superstore on August  and  ahead of the kids going back to the classroom in September. Asda was unable to explain why the items were priced so low. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

But many forces do not publish data for misconduct.One recently retired officer said: “Until all our police forces come out and provide figures the public will believe we are happier hiding the reality of police corruption than dealing with it.“No wonder shows like Line Of Duty are so popular. We should be using its success to encourage more openness.But instead, many forces are battening down the hatches, trying to push the subject off the public agenda.”As fans hang on for season six of the hit drama — and catch up with re-runs — here are some cases of police corruption where real le was stranger than fiction.IN Line Of Duty, “H” is the codename for a senior officer, or possibly a group of officers, who control bent coppers on behalf of an organised crime gang.Real-le corruption has reached the upper ranks of the police also.Met Commander Ali Dizaei was jailed in  for perverting the course of justice, using his position to frame a man.He became the most senior copper in  years to be given a prison sentence.That represented a spectacular fall from grace for a man who had been in charge of , officers across West London.A few years ago, I tracked him down and persuaded Dizaei to meet me. He insisted HE had been framed by corrupt, racist officers afraid he would spill the beans.It was hard to work out whether this was a smokescreen orhe really had been caught up in something so toxic it had cost him his career.CAREER-crook Hunter, played by Brian McCardie, spread murder and mayhem through Line Of Duty’s anti-corruption unit AC-.But his crimes pale beside those of real-le bank robber and cocaine baron Mickey Green, who had close links with corrupt police here and in Western Europe in the Eighties and Nineties.The West Londoner employed a stable of bent coppers to stay one step ahead of the law. It is alleged he got corrupt detectives to frame his criminal rivals too.Green is believed to have bribed his way out of a drug-smuggling charge in Spain. He already had links to Italian Mafia and Colombian drug cartels, pulling off huge cocaine deals with the world’s most dangerous drug baron, Pablo Escobar.One ex-detective believes Green had enough evidence of corruption to bring down many senior officers in the South East, making him untouchable.IN series three, DC Arnott Martin Compston is accused of being the gangland informant and corrupt cop known as “The Caddy”.Arnott also finds himself framed for the murder of Lindsay Denton.In real le, officers working to expose corruption risk facing trumped-up charges because they are considered “rats” by colleagues. . . sometimes even including law-abiding officers.They know these allegations come with the territory.One of my sources told me that, in the summer of , an anti-corruption officer on one force was accused of sexually abusing his niece.It later emerged she had been pressured by criminals to make the complaint.The case was dropped when the niece withdrew her statement to police.That came after her father was recorded referring to the accusations as . The father later admitted he had convinced her the abuse had taken place.“That manshould have been prosecuted, at the very least, for wasting police time,” the same detective believed.“But the officer in question begged his superiors to drop everything – all for the sake of his family.”The officer never recovered from the ordeal and was eventually moved from the anti-corruption unit to a desk job.The same detective added: “He split up with his we and his kids can’t get what he was accused of out of their heads. Poor b*****d.”ZEALOUS Ted Hastings Adrian Dunbar heads up Line Of Duty’s AC- unit.I have encountered a handful of Hastings types over the years but one stands out.I first met “Bfo” in the mid-Seventies, when he was chief of detectives at a suburban police station and I was training as a journalist.Bfo wore his heart on his sleeve, was softly spoken, respectful to women and prepared to talk over a pint with the “enemy”, as journalists were considered by police at the time. There is no way Bfo was on the take. Like Hastings, he earned incredible loyalty from his detectives as he was ready to put himself on the line for them.Bfo later headed an anti-corruption unit in a notorious period in police history.“No one  wanted the f***ing job,” he told me. “But I saw it as a challenge and I knew the bosses would keep well away from me. Most of them hated my guts and wanted me to screw it up.”Like Hastings, Bfo was brilliant at getting inside the heads of his colleagues.“I know instinctively when something’s wrong,” he said. “I don’t get angry with people who lie to me. I keep it gentle, low-key.“Then they usually tell me the truth. You can’t run an anti-corruption unit on fear. You need to pull togetheryou’re to smoke out the bad apples.“I can see a lot of me in Hastings. But he needs to watch his back. He’ll be sacricedhis superiors get twitchy.”A FORMER policeman I have known for more than  years, nicknamed “The Grinder”, makes Line Of Duty’s corrupt John Corbett – played with such force by Stephen Graham – appear relatively harmless.Grinder has always claimed he is NOT corrupt and that he was only labelled as such by scheming colleagues.That came after he infiltrated a gang of renegade crooked officers in a bid to help his superiors bring them to justice.Instead, those officers claimed HE was the corrupt one. Most of that group took early retirement before any charges were brought, so it is impossible to know for sure who was telling the truth.When I visited Grinder at his villa last year, I could immediately see that he had earned a lot more money over the course of his career than most ordinary police officers could claim to.Behind the wrought-iron gates was a substantial property with a long driveway, swimming pool and tennis court.There were CCTV cameras dotted around, while two rottweiler guard dogs bounded out of the back door.Grinder, now in his seventies, said: “I don’t deny I had to pull a few stunts back then.“But I wasn’t a bent copper like they all tried to make out.“The ‘rules’ of the game were very dferent back then.“You had to do certain things in order to put the bad guys away.”A GANG similar to Line Of Duty’s Organised Crime Group was led by Liverpool hood Curtis “Cocky” Warren.After being acquitted of drugs charges in , Warren crowed at customs officials: “I’m off to spend my £million from the first shipment and you can’t f***ing touch me!”Having police on the payroll was crucial to his criminal empire. Among them was Elmore Davies, a senior copper with Merseyside Police who was jailed for trying to get one of Cocky’s acquaintances off a firearms charge. Cocky also used corrupt officers to help him land huge shipments of cocaine from Colombia.A former Liverpool detective said: “Cocky made sure a lot of his bent coppers joined him on actual dealings with the Colombians. That meant they couldn’t wriggle out of involvement.

Recent outbreaks have emerged in Vietnam, New Zealand and parts of China where there had been no cases for some months.Importation of contaminated food and food packaging is a feasible source for such outbreaks and a source of clusters within existing outbreaks.While it can be confidently argued that transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route, the potential for movement of contaminated items to a region with no Covid- and initiate an outbreak is an important hypothesis.An infected food handler has the potential to become an index case of a new outbreak. The international food market is massive and even a very unlikely event could be expected to occur from time to time.Prof James Wood, head of the Veterinary Medicine department at the University of Cambridge, told The Sunday : “The authors discuss, very sensibly, how it is important that factory workers must be incentivised not to go to work when symptomatic or in contact with Covid- cases.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He warned we had probably reached the near limits of what can be reopened. Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, had said the reopening of schools should be prioritised, insisting they must be first to reopen and last to closeany restrictions were reintroduced. How will children be kept safe and what will the classroom look like  Schools are being told to keep classes or year groups apart as much as possible to prevent the virus spreading. This means limits on mixing in hallways and a ban on assemblies, collective worship and choirs - as there is an increased risk of infection from singing and shouting. Break times and lunch could be staggered to keep children apart. Social distancing should be maintained, although the guidance accepts that teachers may not always be able to stay two metres apart from pupils. Classrooms should have forward-facing desks to limit the spread of the virus and windows and doors should be opened where possible to improve ventilation. Strict cleaning measures should be in place along with access to handwashing facilities and sanitiser for pupils.  What happensthere is an outbreak Schools will have to declare an outbreakthey have more than two coronavirus cases in two weeks or there has been a surge in pupils taking sick days where they might have coronavirus.Mobile testing units can be sent to schools to stem the spread of the virus. Children who have been in close contact with a student with Covid- will have to self isolate at home. The whole year group may have to isolate but the entire school will not have to close unless local health protection teams deem it necessary. Schools will be asked to keep a record of close contacts between staff and pupils in dferent groups - but no details have been given on how this would work in practice.

He added: However, I think there is a case for regionalisation. I think itaposs harder to do within a country – people say, with France for example, why donapost you just do this region and not the other  The answer is itaposs quite easy to travel about the country so weaposre not able to do it like that. He said: Where there are islands, I think itaposs something we have said before we will look at and we are looking at. It depends on levels of data you have. We are looking in to how you can do regionalisation effectively.  But Mr Shapps also suggested it might be too dficult to do a regional quarantine without the right levels of information. He said on Sky News: Itaposs still rather too dficult to do the kind of regionalisation that youaposre talking about because we just donapost have the same control where. The news comes as the government added Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago to the list of countries requiring travellers to self-isolate uponto the UK. But Portugal has now been removed from the list, meaning Brits can now travel to the country without the need to quarantine on .  The Canary Islands has experienced a rise in daily cases with around  reported in the last  hours to Friday. There are a total of , active cases on the islands at the moment, health officials say. Most are in Grand Canaria, but also a few hundred in Tenere and Lanzerote. The Government reviews quarantine measures weekly so Brits are running out of time to get a holiday in before the summer season ends. Mr Shapps has issued a warning that any air bridge could be axed at short notice meaning Brits would face a mad dash back home to avoid having to quarantine.  Reminding people of his own last-minute rush to get back from Spain, Mr Shapps tweeted: “Data shows we need to remove Croatia, Austria and Trinidad  Tobago from our list of #coronavirus Travel Corridors to keep infection rates DOWN. “If you arrive in the UK after  Saturday from these destinations, you will need to self-isolate for  days. “Data also shows we can now add Portugal to those countries INCLUDED in Travel Corridors. “Only travelyou are content to unexpectedly -day quarantinerequired ” "},{"url":null,"title":"tories were football team would","story":"NewsopinionIf the Tories were a football team they would lose - - and none of them resignDuring the floods Boris Johnson was on holiday and during high-level meetings about the virus he was on a weekend break.

During the floods he was on holiday and during high-level meetings about the virus he was on a weekend break. Now, during the collapse of the economy, he’s camping. He’ll emerge from Brexit talks in Brussels, and say: “I’ve no idea what we decided as I was driving round the table in a kiddies’ pedal car.” Angela Merkel will announce that a report on post-Brexit imports was presented to the meeting but Boris Johnson set fire to it as he was bored so they’ve got to start all over again. And Britain has become worst at almost everything. We’ve had the highest rate of fatalities from the virus, the fewest tests, and the worst recession. It’s asthis government is determined we’re always at the bottom. Maybe they look on the internet and scream: “Oh no, India has more people killed by tigers than us.

Tougher measures for areas of Greater Manchester and Lancashire came into force at midnight, with people now advised not to socialise with anyone outside their household, and funerals and weddings limited to  people. The Government said it was concerned that a rise in people testing positive for coronavirus in Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle was due to social mixing particularly among  to -year-olds.

Mum-of-three Jolene Stanley earns just £ a week but her sideline entering ­competitions means that is where she really cleans up. Jolene said: “From the first competition, I was addicted. “In the first year in , I won £, worth of prizes. “My friends and family joke that I must be the luckiest ­person in the country.” Jolene, , scours the web every day for prize draws and giveaways and has bagged more than £, in toys and treats for her family and friends. Her first massive win came when she was ­pregnant with her eldest son and saw her walk away with a £, top-of-the-range pram.  Since then, Jolene has pocketed everything from gig tickets to flash holidays, scooping so many freebies that last Christmas cost her next to nothing. She takes home between  and  prizes every single month, and says her luckiest streak was in September , when she picked up  prizes. Jolene has one son, Stanley Constable, seven, from a previous relationship, and two children, Ivy, three, and Charlie, one, with her carer ­partner James Houghton, . And they all share in her good fortune. Jolene now calls herself a seasoned “comper” – the term given to someone who enters prize giveaways religiously.  Just two months after she picked up her posh pram, Jolene landed a VIP ­experience driving supercars around a racetrack. She said: “I love winning but it’s not all about the big prizes. I love the little ones too, especially when they come from new brands and small businesses.” At first, although successful, Jolene was not organised. Rather than setting aside a specic time to scour the web for prizes, she checked her phone whenever she had a chance and entered as many competitions as she could.  But, at the start of , she vowed to be more strategic – and that system has brought in ­some reliable wins. Jolene said: “I decided I wanted to win enough to get Christmas for free. So, I started setting aside three nights a week for comping. “I’d categorise the prizes, ­dedicating one day to vouchers, one to toys and one to parenting giveaways. If I spotted something great during the day, I would enter that, too.” Jolene’s approach paid off as in  alone, she won around £, of freebies and managed to get Christmas virtually free, thanks to a pile of fab festive pressies and a deluxe dinner.  She said: “My total spend for Christmas was £. Everything  was taken care of by prizes. “I gave James a bottle of rum, a camping stove and a sock ­subscription and we also had a family day out at Gulliver’s theme park. “I gave Stanley a £ scooter and Ivy a new bike. I also won £ worth of Amazon vouchers, which I used to get stocking fillers. “Then I gave the kids a £ ­climbing frame as a joint present. I got a £ Tesco voucher and a £ LoveShop voucher, which can be used at multiple high street shops, which took care of everything .” One of Jolene’s favourite things about her hobby is that it allows her to spoil her loved ones.  In the past, she has taken friends and family with her on minibreaks, spa weekends, for afternoon tea or out for fancy meals. And once a month, kind-hearted Jolene, from Wivenhoe in Essex, also makes a ­donation to her local food bank. Her best prizes include tickets to a Spice Girls gig, a stay at a five-star resort in Portugal, a £, cooker and a seven-course dinner at a Michelin starred restaurant. Jolene has also bagged £, of ­holiday vouchers, a meal cooked by a private chef and a trip to Scotland. Most of her wins come through Instagram but she also scours Facebook and comping forums. “I make more from comping than I do from my job, she said. “The trip to Portugal will always stand out as one of the best things I’ve ever won. We were picked up from the airport by a private chauffeur and driven to this incredible resort. It was like being a celebrity.” And not only do her wins make ­wonderful surprises for her friends and family, they also make everyday le cheaper."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus around forever form another","story":"NewsCoronavirus will be around forever in some form or another, SAGE member warnsSir Mark Walport, a former chief scientic adviser and a member of the Governments Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, said that the pandemic would be controlled by \"global vaccination\"ShareCommentsByHarriet LineLorraine King:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths-rise-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Sir Mark Walport, a former chief scientic adviser, told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that the pandemic would be controlled by global vaccination. But he added that Covid- is not going to be a disease like smallpox which could be eradicated by vaccination. Sir Mark, who is also a member of the Governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , said: This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations. So a bit like flu, people will need re-vaccination at regular intervals. The scientist also warned that it is possible the virus will get out of control again, but said more targeted measures can now be used instead of a generic lockdown. His comments came after the head of the World Health Organisation said he hopes the coronavirus pandemic will be over within two years. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it took two years to overcome the Spanish flu in , but that advances in technology could allow Covid- to be stopped in a shorter time. Speaking in Geneva on Friday, he said: Of course, with more connectiveness, the virus has a better chance of spreading.  But at the same time we have also the technology to stop it and the knowledge to stop it. So we have a disadvantage of globalisation, closeness, connectedness but an advantage of better technology. So we hope to finish this pandemicless than two years. He urged national unity and global solidarity. More than . million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and , have died, according to Reuters.Some scientists have suggested coronavirus could follow a similar pattern to the deadly Spanish flu, which swept the globe in three waves, claiming about  millions lives. It broke out in March  and mainly affected the elderly and infirm during the First World War.

If you are wondering whether to pour the milk in first or let the hot water take preference then Grant Harrold can offer some pearls of wisdom. The former royal butler has revealed not only how to make the perfect cuppa but heaposs also shared an insight into the Queenaposs favourite tea. He said the -year-old monarch is a fan of Assam and Earl Grey tea and she prefers to have milk added after the hot water. Mr Harrold, who worked for Prince Charles from  until , said since the th century this has been the traditional way to serve tea and it has been adopted by the royal family. He previously spoke about his tea-making skills on the BBC Three comedy show Miss Holland. I am sure the Queen enjoys her Assam or her Earl Grey the traditional way, made with tea leaves in a teapot and poured into a fine bone china teacup, he said. She will also use a strainer. It is also a myth that members of Royalty use their pinky when drinking, I have never seen that happen once. The tradition began when potter Josiah Spode created bone china teacups which didnapost crack when filled with boiling hot tea.What do you think  Join the debate in our comments shown belowBut for those who couldnapost afford the expensive and high-quality cups they continued to pour milk into their teacup first. The two methods were often used as a way of telling how wealthy an inidual is. Mr Harrold said the steps to making a perfect royal cup of tea is to pour the tea into the cup from a teapot. Then you add milk to the cup after the tea before you stir back and forth.  But while you are stirring you must never use a circular motion and never touch the side. To drink prefect tea perfectly you should sip and not slurp. Grant tweeted out his advice on making the perfect tea to his , followers this week to mark aposAfternoon Tea Weekapos. However the name he has used to call himself has plunged him into hot water with the royal family.

Nigel Wright, , a married father-of-two, is now facing up to  years in jail for the plot which a judge said he had delighted in. Wright represented Grimsbyaposs Freshney ward on North East Lincolnshire Council after winning the seat for the Tories in . Previously he served as the youngest-ever chairman of the Great Grimsby Conservative Association.Wright later switched to UKIP and stood for the Brigg and Goole constituency in the  General Election, polling just , votes, reports GrimsbyLive.But at the Old Bailey on Thursday, Wright was convicted of contaminating jars of baby food with shards of metal in an elaborate blackmail of Tesco. He demanded £. million in Bitcoin from the retailer infor information about where he had hidden the jars.  The sheep farmer, from Market Rasen, in Lincolnshire, denied the charges. But he was found guilty of two counts of contaminating goods and three counts of blackmail. He claimed he was threatened by a group of travellers. The court heard two mothers found the metal fragments when they were feeding their children after Wright began his two-year campaign in the spring of . He threatened to inject tins of fruit with cyanide and salmonella unless the supermarket giant handed over the cash in Bitcoin.  Wright signed off his emails and letters aposGuy Brush  the Dairy Pirates + Tinkerbell the naughty fairy,apos and claimed he represented dairy farmers who had been underpaid by Tesco. He triggered two nationwide recalls on Cow  Gate and Heinz baby food as a result of the threats, prompting the supermarket to clear , products from the shelves. A detective posed as a Tesco employee named Sam Scott and handed over £, in the crypto-currency to trap the blackmailer. Wright was caught on CCTV buying wine and flowers for his we after placing a contaminated jar on the shelves of a Tesco branch in Lockerbie in Scotland on November  last year. He also placed two jars of contaminated food on the shelves of a shop in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.  Prosecutor Julian Christopher said Wright took aposdelightapos in his extravagant plan to outsmart the supermarket giant. He believed he could aposget richapos without leaving any trace of his identity by using the bitcoin cryptocurrency and downloading the browser Tor allowing for anonymous communication. But his emails and letters were forwarded onto police and he was soon unwittingly interacting with an undercover officer. A draft of an email to Tesco was found on one of Wrightaposs devices after his property was searched. The threat read: Imagine a babyaposs mouth cut open blood pouring out and the inside of their belly cut and bleeding. He was remanded in custody ahead of sentence due to take place at a date to be fixed after pre-sentence reports are prepared.  The sentencing next month at the Old Bailey is a world away from his respected role as a Conservative councillor for Freshney in the mid-s. Wright, then , was elected alongside fellow Tory Peter Bellini in May . During campaigning for the Freshney ward, Wright said: My aim is to make the community a clean and safer place, where children can play happily and people do not fear to venture out after dark. Wright campaigned for better flood defences in  after his farm in Healing, Lincolnshire, suffered thousands of pounds worth of crop damage.  A prize ewe he owned drowned, but he managed to save a flock of around  of his sheep. Silage from a nearby turkey farm had contaminated flood water. His animals were again in the news when one of his rams was killed by a dog. Wright called on all dog owners to ensure their pets were kept on a lead after that incident. Having lost his Freshney seat in May , he then stood for the Conservatives in Heneage in May , but came a distant third. He told voters he was fan of Road Wars and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. He campaigned to reduce crime and fear of it.  In a debate in the council chamber about nuisance tenants he said it was essential to monitor behaviour and also to take preventative action.

But I’m coming out of it a dferent woman after the best – and worst – holiday of my le. I’ve been in Chamonix in the French Alps, where I’ve been coming for  years. But I’m used to a gentle kind of escape. Yes, I went on walks, but I left all that extreme outdoorsy stuff and zipwires for other people, especially as I have a fear of heights. Those sorts of adventures were not for me, I thought, and I stayed within the boundaries I’d ­articially created for myself. But since turning  in ­lockdown, I’ve got a new lease of le. I have more energy now than ever before, even though I’m going through the menopause. And I am very aware that we need to do things that make us feel alive and appreciate our time on the planet. Now more than ever. So this holiday, I signed up with a personal trainer, Quentin, for a -day Spartan training programme, which is pretty much the polar opposite of lazing on a beach. I did things that not only exhausted me, they frightened me. It was an hour of training every day, waking up for am, carrying lb on my shoulders and running up a steep hill and wading through ice-cold glacial waters, plus cardio sessions where I wanted to be sick. Pull-ups, weights, climbing walls, monkey bars – it was gruelling. I hated every minute and just when I thought I’d finished, he made me sprint for  more minutes. But you know what  I never stopped. I gritted my teeth, fought the tears and found my inner strength. And when it did finally finish and I was released for the day, I had the biggest sense of pride. I never knew I had such willpower and that my body possessed so much strength. Not bad for . What do you think  Join the debate in our comment section below But in Chamonix I have seen other -year-olds taking on ­ultra-marathons, -year-olds climbing peaks that make you shudder, and -year-olds, men and women, trekking for miles. This valley shatters the ­stereotype of putting your feet up as you get older. Knowing what I was capable of, mentally and physically, led me to have a completely dferent holiday with my kids as well.I went to the waterparks with them and jumped in from dizzying heights. Instead of thinking, “Nope, you daft idiot, you can’t do that”, I was saying, “you can do it!” And I wenton to conquer my fear of heights.With my -year-old son, I climbed ft up into the treetops and did an obstacle course where I had to balance on a thin wire. My heart was in my mouth, it was the most horrible experience of my le, but I did it. And then zip-wired over a beautul lake – I ‘d always thought I could never be one of those people. So many of us are stuck in our comfort zones and give up as we get older. You don’t have to go on an expensive holiday, but you can challenge yourself to do new things, no matter your age. And you should – to truly feel alive. Boris taking the teepee Boris Johnson has disappeared to Scotland on holiday. You’d think he could have waited. You wouldn’t have caught his hero, Churchill, booking a week at Butlin’s during the Battle of Britain. The PM left useless Gavin Williamson to cope with thousands of angry and upset A-level pupils, who needed far more consideration.  The PM has been tracked down to a teepee with his fiancée Carrie Symonds and their baby Wilfred. Let’s hope he’s doing his fair share of dirty nappies because he clearly doesn’t give a s*** about our kids. Food shop risk takes the biscuit More Covid confusion this week – can we catch it from our weekly shop or not  Lab tests have shown it can survive for hours,not days, on ious forms of plastic. And the virus is more stable at lower temperatures, which is how most food finds its way to our shops and doors. But some scientists reckon that outside a lab, the virus cannot survive for long anyway. Hmmm. To be on the safe side, the advice is to sanitise your hands after you get out of the shop – so pick, pack, wash. Then you should wash your hands after handling any packaging and before eating too. Which is a small price to pay for a custard cream. Taylor sums it up Teenager Vitoria Mario couldn’t afford to go to uni to study maths – until Taylor Swt entered the equation. The pop superstar donated £, to her GoFundMe page to help Vitoria smash the £, target she had set to cover her accommodation, food and books at Warwick University. Vitoria moved to London from Portugal four years ago, leaving behind her family. When she arrived, she couldn’t speak English, but has gone on to get two A*s and an A in her A-levels. She’s one smart girl but not eligible for any grants, so had to try her luck online.  She wrote she was a “black girl with a dream” and that dream was to be a mathematician, which would also help her family have a better le. And Taylor paid out to make that possible. But like Vitoria said, her story is not unique. So many talented kids from disadvantaged ­backgrounds can only dream of going to uni. And it would need more than TayTay’s piggy bank to sort that out... perhaps a government that wants to give everyone an equal chance at le  Jawahir set for Match of the Day Jawahir Roble is the first black, female, Muslim, hijab-wearing referee in the UK. A Somalian refugee, she hopes that one day she will be running around the pitch in the Premier League. JJ, as her friends call her, wants to inspire more women to get into refereeing and hopes England ladies will be the best football players in the world. Her parents were not happy with the idea of her playing football at first because she’s a girl and she had to hide her muddy boots when she came home. But their attitude changed when they saw her passion. Only a few tens of thousands of white male minds to change now, JJ. But I reckon she’s the girl for the job and there will soon be a seat for her on Match of the Day. Home school is out Not long to go until the school bell finally rings – and it will be music to my ears. My kids have been with me   since March and, boy, are they ready to shake off their mum and see their friends and teachers. Not being able to run around and have a giggle with their mates has hit them hard. At my son’s high school, they will continue playing cricket, but not rugby or football as they’re contact sports. And my daughter’s primary will have social bubbles to cut down on them bumping into other children. It’s going to be dferent, but I don’t think it will faze them. They all need to get back in the playground, where they belong.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later.

According to a constitutional expert, the  Succession of the Crown Act rule that royals who are sixth-in-line to the throne and above must ask the presiding monarch for permission to marry is likely to apply to Archie one day. Expert Iain MacMarthanne explained Archie is likely to be subject to the same royal rule as his cousins - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.Archie Harrison, one, is expected to be raised in Montecito, Santa Barbara, after Meghan Markle, , and Prince Harry, , bought a home and settled there last month.While Montecito is something of a celebrity haunt it is miles away from the royal bubble Archie may have grown-up in had his parents not left the UK. Meghan and Prince Harryaposs decision to ditch their roles as senior royals was in part motivated by their wish to give Archie a more peaceful le. While the doting parents did not give Archie a royal title following his birth, he is still seventh in line to the throne and will move up the line of succession when his grandfather Prince Charles, , becomes king. Once Prince Charles is king Archie will automatically become a prince and it will be up to him to decide whether he wants to use his royal title when he reaches .  However, evenArchie decides against using his HRH style, there is still a chance he will be subject to a royal law surrounding marriage, one royal expert has claimed.Mr MacMarthanne told Express : Prior to the Succession of the Crown Act  all descendants of George II, under the terms of the Royal Marriages Act , unless the issue of a princess who had married into a foreign royal family, had to obtain the sovereign’s permission to marry in order to retain their rights in succession.The  Act sought to bring multiple pieces of outdated and discriminatory legislation relating to the monarchy up to date. Through this Act male primogeniture was abolished, allowing the first born child irrespective of gender to become heir apparent.  The disqualication from inheriting the throne by marrying a Catholic was removed and the Royal Marriages Act of  was repealed, resulting in only the first six in line to the throne being required to obtain the sovereign’s permission. Either Prince Charles or Prince William are likely to be on throne when Archie becomes old enough to marry. If Meghan and Harryaposs son does one day wish to tie the knot itaposs expected he will have to seek royal consent, just as other senior royals. Mr MacMarthanne added: Consequently, should the children of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge wish to marry, they will be required to seek the sovereign’s permission.

Harry sparked headlines in July when he told members of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust that its history must be acknowledged and work done to “right those wrongs”. But in a web call with members last week, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – president and vice-president of the trust – insisted they were keen to continue the Queen’s legacy. Royal watchers claim it is proof the couple are keen to improve relations with the Royal Family, which have been further soured by the book, Finding Freedom. It is understood the book – which reveals rts between the royals – was written with Harry and Meghan’s ­approval, but left the Queen ­“upset and disappointed”. In the latest web chat, Meghan, , admitted she was “newer to the Commonwealth”, but said: “It wasn’t until joining the family I was able to meet so many young people throughout the Commonwealth. “They came with a question, they always offered a solution and that’s why I’m incredibly proud to work with the QCT, but why it’s the continuation of the legacy of your grandmother.” Speaking from the couple’s new £million home in Calornia, -year-old Harry also heaped praise on his grandmother. He said the Queen, , had achieved everything she wanted to after taking on the “huge responsibility” of the Commonwealth. A source told the Sunday People: “The Queen is fiercely protective of the Commonwealth.She wants her work to carry on through younger family members when she’s gone. “It feels like Harry and Meghan are finally trying to build bridges as I think despite their popularity in certain quarters, it has dawned on them they need the Royal Family more than it needs them.” Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: “When Meghan and Harry last spoke, they made fools of themselves.  They ­managed to ­confuse the ­uncomfortable history of the British Empire with the modern Commonwealth, which caused derision.” Ms Seward also told how the couple’s biggest asset was undoubtedly their family.

The bookaposs authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand spoke to more than  sources - including the coupleaposs friends, staff and royal aides - to learn the key information about their short time in the royal family. The book, called Finding Freedom, has made a catalogue of fascinating revelations about The Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs lives before they quit the royal family including gts given to them by their powerful supporters. It claims generous benefactors loaned the couple private jets and they were even loaned houses or offered luxury accommodation with peppercorn rents and even hotel rooms had their rates hugely slashed.The array of freebies afforded to the royal couple by generous pals amount to millions, the Daily Mail reports.According to the book Meghan may have been offered a heavily discounted hotel room for her first date with Harry in July  at Soho House in central London. The authors wrote in the book: She settled on an outfit and then got started on her make-up in her suite at Soho House’s Dean Street Townhouse property. Meghan had been offered a heavily discounted stay at the five-star Dorchester Hotel but chose the luxurious room secured by Markus [Anderson — Soho House director and Meghan’s friend] instead. As a celebrity and influencer, Meghan was regularly offered free holidays, travel discounts, and the like. But she turned down the Dorchester amid a Hollywood boycott after the hotel chain’s owner, the Sultan of Brunei, introduced sharia law in his country, including death by stoning for those found guilty of gay sex. A suite at Soho House in Dean Street costs from £ a night - it is not known how much Meghan paid for it. Following their first date the couple enjoyed a short courtship before they got married in May . During that time they were aposput upapos in a private four-bedroom cottage in the Cotswolds Soho Farmhouse and at the Soho House property at Babington in Somerset, thanks to more generosity by Mr Anderson - managing director of the Soho House Group. The cottage typically costs £, a night. The book says: He put them up at a private four-bedroom cottage, tucked away from the main members’ Soho Farmhouse.  In Oxfordshire, barely an hour-and-a-half outside of London, it was the perfect retreat from the city. Although the stone house stood on  acres of English countryside, they still enjoyed sashimi and other Japanese dishes delivered to their cottage from Pen Yen, one of the restaurants on the property. Mr Anderson, who had a front-row pew at the coupleaposs wedding, also arranged for Meghan and Harry to spend a weekend at Babington House, a Georgian manor near Bath. Babington House is owned by Nick Jones, the husband of TV and radio presenter Kirsty Young. When news of the coupleaposs romance broke in October  Meghan’s best friend, Canadian socialite and stylist Jessica Mulroney, was tasked with helping her get to the UK for a private visit. According to the book Meghan flew in a private jet which would cost around £, for a one way trip to London from Toronto. The book says: Jessica arranged for her to use the private jet of the Canadian real-estate power couple Krystal Koo and Michael Cooper. Long-time friends of Jessica’s, the couple had run interference in the past for Harry and Meghan and were more than happy to help.  Fancying a trip to London themselves, Krystal and Michael joked about hiding Meghan in one of the new suitcases Meghan had bought.’ Inge Solheim, an adventure guide from Norway, had previously helped out Harry and his then girlfriend Cressida Bonas and in January  he was asked to arrange a trip to the Arctic Circle for the couple. This included a week in a cabin in Tromsö at the very tip of Norway. Finding Freedom mentioned the trip, saying: There, Harry and Meghan enjoyed seven days of dog-sledding, whale-watching, dining on local delicacies and snuggling to watch as the aurora borealis lit up the skies. Guests wishing to spend a week in a luxury tent with glass roof would have to fork out £,, while business-class flights to Tromsö costs around £,. The book does not claim the holiday was a freebie.  When the couple got married in St Georgeaposs Chapel dfusers by luxury scent brand Diptyque adorned the building. They cost £ each and in the book the the authors said coverage of this matter proves media bias against the couple but they were ‘provided by Diptyque’. It is not clearthey were given to the couple for free. Harry and Meghan enjoyed a secret honeymoon which, the authors note, they had flown to on a private jet loaned by a friend. They spent the majority of the week-long trip in the sun at a location so private, most of their friends still don’t know where it was. Two months after their wedding Meghan and Harry enjoyed a break with the actor George Clooney and his lawyer we, Amal, at their home on Lake Como. George arranged a private flight for the couple which would cost from £,. The book notes: A few months after the drama with her father, George Clooney arranged for Harry and Meghan to fly from London to Lake Como on his own private jet.  During the couple’s successful tour of Australia in October , they were supported by Meghanaposs best friend Jessica. Jessica helped to style Meghan and travelled privately to be with her. Jessica’s husband, Ben Mulroney, the son of former Canadian PM Brian Mulroney, was also there and at the time he was Canada’s top TV anchor . The book says: In Sydney to take on engagements and host the fourth Invictus Games, Harry and Meghan managed to sneak out for an evening off with Jessica and Ben Mulroney, the latter of whom was covering the Games for Canada’s CTV network. The couple had announced Meghan’s pregnancy on this tour. A real-estate billionaire loaned them his home for an intimate and completely secret evening with a five-course meal prepared by a private chef. The billionaireaposs generous gt is valued at around £,.  Pregnant Meghan flew back to London with Amal Clooney and her twins after her lavish baby shower in New York in February , as the book confirms The flight home would have cost at least £,. Meghanaposs kind-hearted pals, which include tennis champion Serena Williams, paid for her to stay at the Mark Hotel. The total estimated bill is around £, which includes the penthouse suite which costs a whopping £, a night. Finding Freedom also claims the couple and baby Archie enjoyed a trip in Elton Johnaposs took Elton’s private plane from Ibiza to the singeraposs home in Nice, France, in the summer of  which would have cost £,they had booked it privately. The trip resulted in the couple being accused of hypocrisy as Harry launched his ‘eco’ travel initiative Travalyst soon afterwards.  The book claims Harry regretted ignoring the advice of Press supremo Sara Latham, who had warned him he would face criticism. Harry’s trip to an eco summit in August  attracted further controversy after he spoke about protecting the environment. He flew to the event at a hotel in Sicily in a privately rented jet and used a helicopter to get to the resort in Verdura.The Camp Google summit brought together celebrities and the rich and is believed to have cost the tech giant  million.The book says Harry flew one way by private jet — and the company picked up the bill. A night at the resort cost from £, a one-way flight to Palermo, business class is around £ and a private jet from Palermo to London would amount to £,. It says: The tech giant footed the bill for everything, including travel to the resort and back. Harry’s original plans were to fly commercial, there and back on the same day, but while at the event he accepted a lt back to London on an attendee’s private jet so he could stay a day longer and discuss his work on a sustainable tourism initiative.apos Authors Scobie and Durand say Frogmore Cottage was given to the couple as a ‘gt from the Queen’ .Meghan and Harry moved into the historic Grade II-listed house in Windsor in  after infamously spending £. million of taxpayers money to upgrade and improve it.It can never be sold but a -bedroom house on Crown land in Windsor recently sold for £. million.The couple enjoyed a stay at a £. million Mille Fleurs house in Vancouver from November  until March . Finding Freedom says the house was secured for them by Ben Mulroney via his pal, music producer David Foster, whose friend owns the house and their rent was ‘well below market value.’ If they paid full rent it would be as much as £, a month, or a total of £,.

Charlotte Roe was told the devastating news last year that she had an aggressive form of bile duct cancer.Despite a major operation and chemotherapy, the -year-old this week received the heartbreaking news that the cancer is back, Derbyshire Live reported.The former Royal Derby Hospital nurse was also told that she might only have months to live. But Charlotte, who has also worked at Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham, said she refuses to give up her fight for le. A GoFundMe page for the Duffield woman, who met her “soulmate” Kyle last year, has raised an incredible £, in little over  hours, with over , people donating. The money could be used for one of two potentially le-saving treatments, one of which is only available in the US. The only other option is more chemotherapy on the NHS, but this is not a cure for the cancer. Charlotte said: “On Thursday I had an appointment with my oncologist, I was about to go onto my final round of chemotherapy.  “They said the cancer was back and I had spots all over my liver. I was in shock and I asked how long I’d got. They said they didn’t know but it could be a few months. I can’t even explain what it was like to hear that. “I don’t want to believe that yet, I want to try and find some ground-breaking medicine. “I am not ready to give up and I would give anything for a little bit longer. The support on the gofundme page has made me want to fight even more for a chance at le. “Me and my partner have got our lives planned out and I can’t imagine not getting to do that. I met my partner in July  and I was living le as a normal -year-old and paediatric nurse.” One treatment available is called SIRT, a new immunotherapy treatment available in the UK, and the other is an advanced type of liver transplant -available only in the US. Neither come with funding. Charlotte was first told she had cholangiocarcinoma in November , when she was . After visiting the hospital for scans for an autoimmune disease she has had for ten years, doctors found by chance that she had cancer. Charlotte had no symptoms of the rare cancer and had never heard of it before. She said: “It was horric. I was going into a normal appointment and I was told I had a tumour.

But while Storm Ellen may finally start to let up, it seems that the summer heat could be gone for good.For the remaining days in August, forecasters predict a mixed bag weather-wise, and while there will still be some sun, any hope of another heatwave before we move into September appear remote.The Met Office said an unsettled outlook was expected with temperatures below average for the time of year. Temperatures are unlikely to exceed -C in London in the next fortnight, according to the BBC, by which point September will have arrived. In Manchester, high temperatures will often struggle to get over -C, with wind and rain are expected too, meaning what is left of summer is set to be a little damp. Overnight, gusts of up to mph buffeted parts of the south-west of England and Wales on Friday, causing the RNLI and HM Coastguard to urge members of the public to be cautious in coastal areas. South Wales Police said a -year-old girl died following an incident in a river in east Cardf on Friday evening. Emergency services, including a police helicopter, responded to reports of a girl in the river in Ball Lane, Llanrumney, at around .pm. At about .pm a -year-old girl was located and despite the best efforts of emergency services she sadly passed away, the force said.  Some  flood warnings remained in places across parts of the UK on Friday night, meaning flooding is expected, while the Environment Agency issued a further  flood alerts for swathes of the south-west.A yellow wind warning issued by the Met Office expired on Friday evening, with no further warnings expected over the weekend, according to forecaster Matthew Box.Itaposs still going to be breezy and blustery tomorrow, but winds will not be as strong as they have been today, he said.  Heavy showers could hit parts of central England with the potential for thunder on Saturday, while southern parts of the country are expected to see sunny spells. Further north it is a mixed bag weather-wise, Mr Box said, with some cloudy but also sunny spells towards the east.  The Met Office said in its long-range weather forecast that the outlook is generally unsettled.A spokesman said: The outlook period begins generally unsettled with strengthening winds accompanied by showers or longer spells of rain across much of the UK. Towards the bank holiday weekend, these spells of rain and strong winds may perhaps become more confined towards northern and eastern areas, with the driest conditions mostly likely in the south. Although, the southwest may see some further spells of wind and rain at times. Temperatures should be near or slightly below the average for this time of year, with a potential for some frost overnight, but otherwise feeling warm in any sunnier spells. Although confidence is low into September, it is likely that the first part will see a transition into a more zonal pattern, with the north unsettled and the south generally drier and warmer. The strongest gust recorded on Friday was mph at the Needles on the Isle of Wight, while Mumbles Head in Swansea saw winds of up to mph. HM Coastguard urged members of the public to keep their distance from the waves, while the RNLI advised visiting leguarded beaches whenever possible and to avoid storm watchingswells become high.

The -strong flotilla, with vessels as big as a football pitch, has descended on the oceans around the Galapagos Islands – where the rich bioersity offers unique insights into our planet. Scientists fear the fleet puts endangered species at risk both by plundering the oceans and from the , plastic bot­­tles thrown overboard every day. They say the boats, each dangling millions of hooks, are targeting sharks that end up in expensive fin soup in markets across China and Hong Kong. In , officials from Ecuador, which owns the islands, intercepted one with  tonnes of refrigerated shark fins on board. Last week, locals spoke of their anger after finding a young shark washed up on a beach with its dorsal fins hacked off. And a whale shark called Hope that recently vanished was shown by its GPS tracker to have last been where the fleet was. What do you think about the story  Join the debate in our comments section below Esme Plunkett, , a British marine biologist based on the island of Santa Cruz, said: “I’ve never known such anger here. “Locals are devastated to see what these fleets are doing.” Darwin visited the islands in .

Conservationists say at least  species, including sea lions, turtles and marine iguanas, have been found entangled in plastic bags or lines, or swallowed plastic. Esme said: “In just  minutes I found  Chinese-labelled bottles in the rocks next to the iguanas.“Waste is not unheard of, but this was in good condition with the labels intact. They take hund­reds of years to degrade. “In two years I’ve never seen plastic waste like this.” It is understood the vessels, which claim to be catching squid, have now turned off their tracking devices to avoid being monitored."},{"url":null,"title":"putin critic alexei navalny taken","story":"NewsPutin critic Alexei Navalny taken to Berlin still in coma after being poisoned by teaSupporters of Alexei Navalny say the Kremlin is responsible for his condition - and delayed his transfer until the poison in his system would no longer be detectableShareCommentsByAnton ZverevKara ONeillTanveer Mann:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsNavalny is a prominent opponent of Vladmir Putin\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He was transferred from a Siberian hospital to Germany early this morning on a special medical plane. Navalnyaposs supporters, who believe a cup of tea he drank was poisoned by the Kremlin, have suggested that his transfer was delayed to ensure there would be no trace of poison left in his system by the time he arrived. Russian doctors insisted they had found no poison and speculated that Mr Navalnyaposs ill health may have been caused by low blood sugar. Early on Saturday morning, Mr Navalnyaposs spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh tweeted: The plane with Alexei has taken off for Berlin. A huge thank you to everyone for your support. The struggle for Alexeiaposs le and health is just beginning and there will be much more to go through, but at least now the first step has been taken.  Mr Navalny, a -year-old politician and corruption investigator who is one of the Russian Presidentaposs fiercest critics, was admitted to an intensive care unit in Omsk on Thursday.He had collapsed on a plane, with footage showing him howling in agony, on the same day after drinking tea that his allies believe was laced with poison. German doctors flew in to evacuate Navalny at the request of his we and allies who said they feared authorities might try to cover up clues as to how he fell ill and that the hospital treating him was badly-equipped. Medical staff at the Omsk hospital initially said on Friday that while Navalnyaposs condition had improved slightly overnight, he was in too unstable a state to be safely transported out of the country.  But last night they said they would not object to him being moved after the German doctors were granted access to Navalny and said they thought he was fit to travel. A senior doctor at the hospital, Anatoly Kalinichenko, said the hospital could help transport Navalny to the airport and that he would be moved within several hours.  We have taken the decision that we do not object to him being transferred to a dferent hospital, Kalinichenko said. Navalnyaposs we Yulia earlier sent a letter to the Kremlin directly appealing for it to intervene and grant permission for him to be allowed to be flown out. Itaposs a shame it took so long for the doctors to make this decision. The plane has been waiting since morning, the documents were also ready then, Navalnyaposs spokeswoman said. Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the hospital, said earlier that Navalny had been diagnosed with a metabolic disease that may have been caused by low blood sugar.  He said traces of industrial chemical substances had been found on Navalnyaposs clothes and fingers and that doctors did not believe he had been poisoned.

The enormous whale emerged from the water and snapped its mouth shut just a few feet from their small fishing boat off the coast of Castletownbere in Cork, Ireland. Thrilling footage shows the beastaposs shocking breach as it emerged from the water as yelps can be heard from the passengers onboard. The sea creatures typically weigh just over six tons and tend to measure about twice the size of the fishing boat. Local David Minihane took the video from onboard the boat alongside his three children and his friendaposs daughter. He told CorkBeo the group regularly go out on the boat and are used to the ocean creatures but that this incident was truly one to remember. The cameraman appeared shaken as the whale splashed the water all over the group before they gathered their belongings and began to chuckle.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Of those,  were in the NHS Grampian area, compared with  in Tayside,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and four in Lanarkshire. No new deaths had been recorded in the last  hours.At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon described the position in Aberdeen as “an improving situation” and said there was “no evidence” of transmission into Aberdeenshire or Moray.Ms Sturgeon said that when the local lockdown is reviewed on Sunday, the government would look at bringing Aberdeen into line with the rest of the country on some aspects of coronavirus policy, such as casinos and bingo halls reopening.We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”Nicola SturgeonElsewhere in Scotland, such venues are scheduled to come back into use on Monday. Previously, Ms Sturgeon has indicated that she would look at reopening Aberdeen’s non-licensed cafes on Wednesday.“On Sunday… we will review the lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen again,” Ms Sturgeon said. “And at that time we hope that we will be able to set out a firm timetable for the lting of these restrictions.“At that point we will also set out whether some of the changes that were announced more generally for the country yesterday – for example, the reopening of venues like bingo halls – will also apply in Aberdeen.”She added: “We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”The first minister added that there was “no evidence to suggest there had been wider transmission” beyond the city of Aberdeen.“That is something that has been looked at very carefully, particularly around Aberdeenshire, particularly given some of the travel patterns and proximity of communities there,” the first minister said.Ms Sturgeon said the cluster associated with those who gathered in the city’s pubs was now under control. But there was an “ongoing concern” about cases not associated with the cluster, but things were improving. In total,  cases have been identied in the Grampian Health Board area since the July .Of those,  were associated with the pub-linked cluster, and , contacts have been identied from those  cases. In the last  hours, there had been an additional seven cases not associated with the original cluster.Earlier this week Aberdeen City Council leaders expressed frustration that the city had not been allowed out of its three week lockdown earlier, warning that , jobs were at risk as a result of the coronavirus.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said: “Of course we have to be mindful of public health, but we also have to be mindful of the economic implications, which could have an impact on public health as well.#It is about balancing competing harms. Economic damage could harm public health through unemployment and poverty. That’s why we thought, in line with the incident management team, that restrictions on travel, household gatherings and hospitality could have been lted earlier.”At her briefing, Ms Sturgeon repeated her warnings about house parties, saying indoor social gatherings were proving one of the major drivers of community transmission of the virus.She said: “That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings.“I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop repeated her plea for the UK Government#s furlough scheme to be extended, particularly in the hospitality and tourism industries.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

further factories linked to tayside coronavirus cluster as cases discovered across three council areas","story":"Two further factories have been linked to a growing coronavirus outbreak in Tayside, as new figures reveal the region now has the highest risk of local transmission anywhere in Scotland.The number of cases linked to the  Sisters food processing plant in Coupar Angus has risen to , and Nicola Sturgeon confirmed  employees have now tested positive for the virus, along with nine of their contacts.Speaking during the Scottish Government’s daily coronavirus briefing on the day Scotland recorded its second-highest number of new cases since May, Ms Sturgeon said  of the  new positive tests recorded overnight were in Tayside.A total of  of the new cases were in the Grampian health board area,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and four in Lanarkshire.NHS Tayside announced on Thursday that anyone living in a household with a factory worker from the  Sisters site, including children, should self-isolate at home and get tested for Covid- as soon as possible.Ms Sturgeon said not all of the  Sisters workforce live in Coupar Angus so the situation involves people stretched across Perth and Kinross, Angus and Dundee.The first minister also confirmed two contacts #have links to other food processing factories in Tayside”, although it is not yet clear which businesses are affected.#The incident management team is now carrying out risk assessments at both of these sites,#Ms Sturgeon said.#There#s no evidence that this outbreak has spread to either factory at this stage but, as you can imagine, that is something that is being looked at very closely.#Ms Sturgeon said lockdown restrictions similar to the ones introduced in Aberdeen two weeks ago had not been imposed because there was currently #minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside#.However, she said she could not rule out introducing further measures in the future and the situation would be kept under #very close review#.A new method of tracking the outbreak has revealed Perth and Kinross has the highest risk of local coronavirus transmission anywhere in Scotland and may require “greater vigilance” from health officials.The region has  surged past other areas dealing with local outbreaks, including Aberdeen, which became the site of Scotland’s first local lockdown following a cluster linked to pubs and bars in the city.A new Scottish Government report considered whether the current number of Covid- infections exceeds what health officials would expect at this stage of the epidemic, based on a new modelling system from Warwick University.It found six local authority areas – Perth and Kinross, Dundee, North Lanarkshire, Angus, Glasgow and Aberdeen – had exceeded expected levels but figures are beginning to trend towards normal.The new method is designed to be more useful than the R number – the average number of people infected by each person – because this figure can be volatile when the overall number of deaths is low.The report states: “While metrics such as the reproductive rate – R number – have been useful in guiding our response to coronavirus so far, the models we use rely on numbers of deaths to track the epidemic.“These have fallen to low levels, which means we need to find new ways to monitor trends in the epidemic.“One of the ways we can do this is to calculate whether the number of confirmed infectionsin each area exceeds the number that was expected, given the number recorded across the country – this is called ‘exceedance’.”Areas with an exceedance level above six are deemed to be at a higher risk of local transmission and may require “greater vigilance”, according to the report.In the week leading up to August , the only areas above this limit were Perth and Kinross, at ., and Dundee, where a number of workers at the  Sisters chicken factory live, at ..Angus came in at ., Aberdeen at ., and levels in Aberdeenshire are beginning to fall back towards background levels.The report stated in most cases the figures are “a reflection of a small number of cases” however, the ongoing nature of the outbreak in Perth and Kinross “may be a cause for concern”.Speaking about lessons learned from the clusters on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said indoor social gatherings are one of the major drivers of community transmission.She warned against defying guidelines on the number of people allowed indoors at once, which she said presented “a very signicant risk”.“That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings,# she said. #I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including

Every day this week we have had lower numbers than Tayside, and it is clear the people of Aberdeen will be asking themselves why they are in lockdown and other parts of Scotland aren’t.“We have asked four or five times now what the infection rate in the city needs to be before the lockdown can be lted and we have never been able to get an answer from the Scottish Government.“We are only asking for clarity on when we will be able to reopen but they have not been able to tell us.#Mr Lumsden added: “They should be listening to the health professionals on the ground in Aberdeen and the lockdown should have been lted when the IMT recommended. What we are seeing now is lockdown being extended when the numbers are far higher in other parts of the country.“I don’t want to see any local lockdowns that aren’t needed because I know first-hand the harm that’s doing to our local economy. There are lots of businesses who can’t get through this.“There is an unfairness around this lockdown. They have got medical experts on the ground – why are they not listening to them ”The number of cases linked to the cluster which sparked the lockdown is .In her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon explained the key dference between the Aberdeen cluster and the Tayside outbreak, which began at the  Sisters plant in Coupar Angus, was the risk of community transmission.She said: #Some people may be looking at Aberdeen and Coupar Angus and wondering why exactly the same approach is not being taken, and the key point is that the nature of the steps we take in dferent outbreaks has to depend on and be guided by the nature of the outbreak.#The assessment of the IMT in Coupar Angus is that there is minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside.#That’s not something we were able to say with any confidence about the outbreak in Aberdeen.#So as things stand, there is a clear focal point for the Coupar Angus outbreak, which was not the case in Aberdeen where the outbreak was associated with a large number of venues across the city.#In each of these cases, and this will continue to be the case in future, we make decisions based on inidual circumstances that we’re dealing with.#In doing so, we take account of the specic risks that need to be addressed, and that is the approach we continue to take as we deal with dferent outbreaks in dferent parts of the country.#The First Minister said she hopes to be able to set out a #firm timetable# for the lting of restrictions tomorrow.In response to Mr Lumsden, a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Unfortunately there is no single level of infection that makes these decisions straightforward. We take into account prevalence, rate of positive tests, number of clusters and other factors. No country’s health advisers can  give an infection rate that means we are able to make certain decisions in regard to lting restrictions. There is a range of considerations about whether we can reach the conclusion that the overall situation in Aberdeen is sufficiently under control that we can start to lt the restrictions.“As the First Minister has made clear, we recognise in particular, the impact on businesses in Aberdeen, particularly those impacted by the restrictions and required to close. That’s why we have made available a £m grant support scheme for businesses in Aberdeen City impacted by local measures.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.,params: .pushPlants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners. Donrsquot worry, it doesnrsquot mean another mouth to feed, there are plenty of really great looking fake ones to buy.Have you tried shopping from other rooms in your house  Yoursquod be surprised at how much you can change your rooms by simply swapping the accessories about.HallwayTherersquos nothing nicer than a warm welcome so donrsquot forget your hallway when yoursquore giving your home a makeover.If itrsquos on the small size then good advice is to keep it nice and bright to give the illusion of space and add colour by adding some prints to the wall, some useful hanging hooks and even a funky doormat.Everything in your hallway needs to have a practical use, but that doesnrsquot mean it has to be boring.You can add plants here too butyoursquore limited on floor space, why not try some hanging baskets or small potted plants on shelves.Maybe go the extra mile and paint the doors in your hallway  This trend is becoming more popular, with people opting for painting their doors and skirting boards, from pink to yellow and even black.Hopefully, these tips have given you some DIY inspiration to give your home a little low-cost makeover."},{"url":null,"title":"online-edinburgh-festival-12-must-see-shows-events","story":"IT WAS almost inevitable that Edinburghs family of art festivals would be a casualty of the coronavirus pandemic ndash and just as inevitable that the organisers of those same festivals, as well as the artists, performers, musicians and actors who make them what they are, would respond accordingly.Thats exactly what has happened.You cant generally hit pause and play at the same time, but the Edinburgh Festival has managed it for its  iteration, with a rich, brave and pioneering programme of mostly digital and online events with here and there a visual treat for capital residents and those tourists who have decided to come anyway.The theatres may be dark but, as the programme makes clear, the artistic light burns bright regardless.My Light Shines On DisplayAs well as being the umbrella title for much of the digital offering from this yearrsquos Edinburgh International Festivalndash Kirsty Wark fronts the programme, which features a performance by Scottish Chamber Orchestra cellist Su-a Lee ndash My Light Shines On is also a light display project which will illuminate the cityrsquos famous festival venues.Using beacons of light which will be visible from vantage points across the capital it has been created by Scottish lighting designers Kate Bonney and Simon Hayes, the duo behind Pitlochryrsquos Enchanted Forest and the Electric Glen in East Renfreshire.The inspiration is the tradition of the so-called lsquoghost lightrsquo in which a light is left on in a theatre even when the venue is lsquodarkrsquo, as all theatres currently are.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Butthe free traders and corporate influencers in Westminster get their way and deregulate the law that currently governs genetic engineering there, gene edited foods could be green lighted, unlabelled, for English plates, so that most people wouldnrsquot realise that they were eating them.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would then be put under heavy international corporate pressure to do the same.Like the old guard, now stigmatised, genetically modiedfood before it, with its unhappy history of failures to deliver and creation of new problems, such as the creation of herbicide-resistant super-weeds, proponents of gene editing spin futuristic yarns about all the miracles theyrsquore rustling up for us.Less starchy potatoes and corn, pork from super-muscly pigs, spicy tomatoes, and mushrooms that resist browning, are some front runners. In fact the mushrooms have already bypassed US Department of Agriculture regulation.How can this second wave of genetically engineered foods be a realistic prospect when the first lot were so unpopular in the UK and the EU that the general public shunned them Proponents claim that gene editing is a precise, safe technology with predictable outcomes. Sound familiar  They say that theyrsquore only making very small changes to the genetic make-up of foods, merely mimicking what might happen through natural mutation.Tellingly, they seek patents for these altered foods. Patents are only grantedyou can show an inventive step that is man-made. So claims that gene editing is simply causing changes that could happen naturally go out the window.Donrsquot worry, though, they assure us that gene editing carries no more risk than conventional breeding. In fact, there is no evidence to support this blaseacute assertion because no feeding studies have been carried out in either humans or animals.Along with scientists from around the world, I attended a briefing on gene editing led by the London-based molecular geneticist Dr Michael Antoniou. It left me deeply concerned. He flagged up the growing body of gold standard scientic research that highlights the unintended and potentially dangerous risks that gene edited foods pose. Far from being precise and predictable, these lab-based, articial interventions damage plant or animal DNA, not just at the intended site of the genetic alteration, but where.For instance, it emerged last year that a hornless bull gene edited by a Minnesota company was unintentionally contaminated by bacterial genes from another species. https:www.technologyreview     recombinetics-gene-edited-hornless-cattle-major-dna-screwup Gene editing alters how genes , which can create new allergens and toxins. The European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility ndash  leading international scientists ndash has expressed grave concerns. They say that the radical nature of gene edited changes could result in ldquounexpectedly high levels of known toxins, or even in the creation of novel ones.So, the bottom line here is that therersquos a push to slip gene edited food ingredients into our food, unlabelled, most likely sneakily lost in multi-ingredient, ultra-processed foods, on the assumption that they pose no risk. So far, the general public is blissfully unaware of it.To ensure public safety and the integrity of the food we eat, its absolutely vital that all ingredients from gene edited crops, plants, or farm animals, be subjected to risk assessment of the most stringent nature.These novel creations must be tightly regulated, with track and trace systems in place so that in the case of a genetically engineered public health disaster, retailers can put out effective product recalls.Most crucially, gene edited food must be clearly labelled as genetically modied so that we can choose for ourselveswersquore prepared to eat it.

The leader of its family policy unit is Cristina Odone, former editor of The Catholic Herald. As such its , among others, is to shore up classic Conservative family values, at the heart of which is marriage. Sadly, the present Prime Minister seems not to have received the memo.Setting aside for the moment the religious and political leanings of those behind this report, its conclusions show the stark and widening gulf between the married well-off and the unmarried poor. Medicine has long recognised the advantages ndash especially to men ndash of tying the knot, but the CSJrsquos findings focus on the enormous benefit that marriage bestows not on the couple, but on their children.Despite being lauded by David Cameron as ldquoa great institution, few subjects have been more ripe for ridicule. The butt of stand-ups down the ages, matrimony is the gag that never stops giving. It can be plumbed endlessly for laughs by the cynical, the wry, the embittered and the romantic. Yet the conclusions of the Centre for Social Justicersquos report are anything but funny.Their statistics show that those on low incomes are far less keen to wed than the wealthy. Once children are born, cohabiting parents are almost four times more likely to separate before a child is five than married parents. The health and educational attainment of children with broken family backgrounds are worse, and their likelihood of having a criminal conviction by the age of  doublestheir parents separated before they were five.These statistics certainly cast matrimony in a starkly black and white light. And it gets worse. The middle classes are not only more likely to marry, but % of high earners do so, compared to % of the poorest. If a straight line can be drawn between cohabitation and unstable family relationships, that is bad news for youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds. Butmarriage truly is the key factor in this downward trajectory,a set of vows and a certicate and a wedding video is the glue that holds the middle classes together, then that is a whole other issue. Suddenly a custom that previously was prevalent across the classes is in danger of becoming a status symbol. Marriage, by this calculation, is synonymous with money.I grew up in the wake of the Beatles and the moon landing, when walking down the aisle was no longer essential, evenyou hoped to have children. Nevertheless the stigma of cohabiting, or becoming parents before you wore a wedding ring, took a long time to fade. When finally it became commonplace society grew more civilised, acknowledging that couples didnrsquot require an official document to take themselves, and be taken, seriously. Cohabiting was no more a byword for casual than marrying was for happy. Yet now, it is deemed a red flag for social disadvantage.The direct correlation between marriage and class suggests that money is at least part of the explanation. Those who are strapped for cash either consider it irrelevant, or not for the likes of them. And the more it is perceived to be for the better off, the less it will appeal to people further down the social spectrum.You canrsquot help wonderingthe wedding industry, as opposed to marriage itself, has created expectations that the hard-up simply cannot meet. With the average Scottish wedding now costing over a staggering pound,, this comes as no surprise. Increasingly the concept of marrying is bound up with the wedding. The status of the couple and their families is proclaimed by the nature of the ceremony, the wedding venue, and the sumptuousness of the reception. Not to mention stag and hen weekends and parties beforehand.It takes at least a year, and usually a lot longer, to book, plan and save for the big day. Ultimately, though, what matters is not the trappings, but making the vows, whether in a religious setting, or a registry office. The seriousness of the bond lies in the couplersquos decision to commit to each other, not in any of the hoopla that follows. Perhaps it is time to separate the legal procedure from the carnival that follows, to consciously uncouple the act of union from this crippling cost.Yet the nub of the problem identied by CSJ is not marriage itself, but hardship. Those living on the bread line do not have the resources, and possibly donrsquot have the inclination, to get officially tied. Given the serious disadvantages suffered when they separate, the answer, surely, is not to coax iniduals into wedlock, asit were the panacea for all their ails, but to digny cohabiting couples and their offspring with the same legal safeguards and tax breaks as those who marry. Protecting the rights of children and parents ndash especially mothers, who commonly look after the kids once a relationship ends ndash would give them a financial safety-net. Many of the outcomes for youngsters described in this report ndash gang membership, criminality, mental and physical health issues ndash are as much the result of penury as the lack of a piece of paper supposedly binding their parents forever.If it is to retain its meaning, marriage has to be a personal choice, not a virtuous act that deserves a reward. It can be done cheaply and quietly, as I can testy, or with terric fanfare, or it can be avoided altogether. Either way, in an enlightened world those in long-term relationships, and couples with children, should be treated by government in exactly the same way as the married. Until that day ndash far off, I fear ndash the gulf between the haves and the have nots will steadily deepen, eroded by a judgemental, moralising and, as wersquove too often seen, hypocritical state.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Tory commentators and many MPs are deeply dischuffed with Mr Johnson, and not just because his Government made an even worse cock-up of the exams than the Scottish Government. Negotiations resumed this week over the withdrawal agreement with the European Union, and it is safe to say that expectations among the Conservative faithful are not high.Indeed, Brexiter Tory MPs, like Iain Duncan Smith, fully expect a sell-out. They think Mr Johnson is preparing to accept a whole range of EU regulations even after we have left. This means no trade deals with free market America, no state aid to key industries, no low tax havens and a ldquobetrayal of fishing.Tory MPs hoped that Boris would be tough on immigration, would cut taxes and rein back bureaucracy, while tackling political correctness and the nanny state. What they got was a bicycling PM who seems to be tough on motorists, not illegals. He has adopted what the Spectator columnist Christopher Snowden, calls ldquopurse-lipped, micro-managing, finger-wagging, lemon-sucking, censorious, anti-business, killjoy policies like the campaigns on obesity and sugar.Not in their wildest dreams did true blue Tories expect their chosen one to increase public spending by more than any Labour government since . Yet, this Government is currently paying the wages of half the working population through furlough, benefits and public sector employment. UK debt is now pound trillion. Thank God Margaret Thatcher is not alive to see it.Mr Johnson hasnrsquot even delivered on scrapping HS, the fast rail line that most Tory MPs think is a white elephant. Instead, he is fantasising about building bridges between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Yet that is not going to keep the Union together. His Brexit deal, it is now clear, has created a gulf between the UK and Northern Ireland.The province has remained in regulatory alignment with the European Unionrsquos single market, which means that there must be the very border checks the PM promised would never happen. Worse, it has handed the SNP a genuine grievance: being denied access to markets with which Northern Ireland can trade seamlessly.Tories are appalled by Mr Johnsonrsquos lack of urgency on Scotland as support for independence grows. The former Tory leader, William Hague, said this week thatthe PM doesnrsquot get his act together the UK will be finished within five years. Tories like Mr Hague think he allowed Nicola Sturgeon to play politics with the coronavirus.What they didnrsquot anticipate was the cack-handed and contradictory approach taken by the UK Government. At first, the lockdown seemed to appeal to the British wartime spirit, which always goes down well on the Right. But far from winning a victory over this viral enemy, Britain has recorded the worst excess death rate in Europe and now the deepest recession.Most Conservatives loath the imposition of masks, which the Daily Mail commentator, Peter Hitchens, calls ldquomuzzles, and which libertarians think are pointless impediments. Many Tory voters spend their holidays in France and the letters columns are full of people complaining about being forced back to Blighty even from regions of France where Covid is almost non-existent.Yet this Conservative Government kept Britainrsquos airports open during the worst phase of the pandemic, allowing  million travellers to come to Britain largely unchecked, including a number from Covid hot spots like Italy and China. And donrsquot even mention track and trace.The exams debacle was the final straw. Tory MPs want the head of the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, on a plate for his chaotic U-turn, but the real criticism is of the Prime Minister. He should surely have seen this coming after the chaos in Scotland. It seems to many asMr Johnson isnrsquot really in charge.His presentation has been lamentable, and even is greatest fans are disappointed with his bumbling delivery and lack of grip. He was never a detail man, and everyone knew he flew by the seat of his pants ndash thatrsquos when he managed to keep them on.Conservatives are pretty forgiving to politicians who think like they do, have the same instincts on nation and values. What is especially damaging is a growing sense that Mr Johnson is just not really a Conservative at all. They expected him to take a tough line with the statue topplers and culture warriors of Black Lives Matters. But instead of banging heads, he avoided confrontation and made only a routine condemnation of vandalism. He allowed Winston Churchill himself to be boxed up in Parliament Square. How could it come to this Part of the problem, I think, is that many Conservatives believed what Labour said about Mr Johnson ndash that he was a bit of a racist, misogynist, homophobic right winger. The most ldquoright-wing prime minister in British history as Labourrsquos John Mc Donnell called him. This he never was.Colourful phrases about Burqa-wearers looking like letter boxes does not a white supremacist make. When he was London mayor, he was careful to keep the black and ethnic community onside and he used to lead LGBT marches wearing a pink stetson. When he became PM he installed more BAME ministers than all previous UK governments combined. You wont hear Mr Johnson using Daily Mail rhetoric about immigrants, he genuinely believes in state intervention and he is quietly a bit of a Europhile. Far from being a free market ideologue, Boris Johnson is a liberal, patrician Tory ndash more like Michael Heseltine, Brexit aside, than Margaret Thatcher.The final insult was this Tory Prime Minister ennobling Claire Fox, a former Revolutionary Communist who used to support the objectives of the IRA. That was the final straw.

Established in  and supported by a unique partnership between the British Council, the Edinburgh International Festival, the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish and UK Governments, it traditionally offers a biennial ministerial forum in which artists and cultural leaders come together with politicians and policy makers to discuss substantial, global issues of mutual interest during the largest annual celebration of the arts in the world ndash the Edinburgh Festivals.The Covid- pandemic prevents hosting the summit at the Scottish Parliament this year. However, the resulting move to a Special Edition entirely online gives us a dferent opportunity, a way to make the Culture Summit even more accessible and available to everyone, be they in business, policy making, politics, economy, the arts, or simply curious. Neither geography nor means is a barrier, all films are freely available on the Culture Summit site from today.In our present circumstances, the summitrsquos title ,The Transformational Power of Culture, seems particularly appropriate. In the midst of a devastating pandemic, governments and cultural leaders alike grapple with unprecedented challenges attempting to save lives and sustain careers. At such times, it is important that a summit such as this, should develop a narrative around the signicance of culture for other facets of human societies.The summitrsquos collaborators in  are actors, theatre directors, choreographers, novelists, librarians, painters, museum curators, musicians and singers. They are also architects, economists, educators, epidemiologists, historians, human rights advocates, medical and social scientists, philanthropists, philosophers and tech entrepreneurs.Very much in this spirit, and by way of an example, when considering an approach to one of our themes, Culture  Education, the summit has chosen to collaborate not only with some amazing young musicians who are part of youth orchestras in Los Angeles and Raploch here in Scotland, but quite deliberately with an economist, an epidemiologist, a neuroscientist and an educational entrepreneur cum philanthropist.This eclectic group of expertise has been enlisted to make the case for why culture matters, and why, from the perspective of health and well-being, economic prosperity, and most important of all, from an humanitarian point of view, it is so vital that culture and creativity together with the encouragement of empathy and emotional intelligence, should play a far greater role in our schools and classrooms.Many of the perspectives of our contributors remind me of the work of the pioneering educational psychologist Howard Gardner, who in , first proposed the concept of multiple intelligence not just linguistic and logical , but spatial, bodily-kinaesthetic, musical, interpersonal and intrapersonal forms of intelligence demonstrated by architects and sculptors, dancers and choreographers, athletes and gymnasts, business leaders, scientists and even politicians.Courtesy of Professor Gardner, the definitions of intelligence become vastly expanded. He argues persuasively that intelligence is not single-minded but multi-faceted. He describes the need for ldquomultiple intelligences to navigate the complex challenges of the world around us.The message for policy makers and politicians is urgent. Beyond the need for hope and inspiration in the lives of young people, there is an emerging body of knowledge from economists to neuroscientists which advocates for educational systems to place far greater emphasis on cultural learning opportunities and creativity from early childhood.Join us in embracing a world of creative potential, demonstrating the critical need for greater recognition of the role of culture as a catalyst to change our future.

Steps need to be taken to prevent people without good and veriable cause for not wearing a mask from entering shops and malls.I accept that this may be harder for small shops to apply, but at least supermarkets and shopping malls with security staff need to implement a no mask, no entry rule. To make things easier, free masks or masks at nominal cost could be available upon entry.It only takes one inidual to unwittingly cause a catastrophe.

I mean, Irsquom a woman who takes an hour to decide what to watch on Netflix, who stares in food-envy at fellow-dinersrsquo meal choices in restaurants, and who, more than once, has been told to remove my rose-tinted specs.Whilst it does look as though countries with female leaders, on the whole, were quicker to lock-down and have been more risk averse when it comes to peoplersquos lives ndash Germany, New Zealand, and Taiwan come to mind as having had far fewer Covid deaths than male-led countries such as the US, Brazil, UK or India, it doesnrsquot explain male-led countries like Greece, for example where Covid deaths remained relatively low.Who can forget Boris Johnsonrsquos ill-fated declaration that hersquod been to a hospital where there were coronavirus patients and he had shaken everyonersquos hand. In the Philippines, which had one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in south east Asia, President Duterte told police and military to take matters into their own hands when dealing with lockdown breakers: ldquoShoot them dead...Do you understand  Dead. None of these are words we could imagine tumbling from current women leadersrsquo mouths.Instead, women like Jacinda Ardern, Angela Merkel and, latterly, after an arguable initial hesitancy, Nicola Sturgeon, have taken a more active listening approach. Taking advice from experts, collaborating with colleagues and, importantly, keeping the ego firmly in check, these leaders were honest and clear from the start. Whilst many world leaders were playing the threat down, Merkel told Germans that % of the population might be affected and that it would be Germanyrsquos biggest challenge since the Second World War.Ardernrsquos early motto was: ldquoWe must go hard and we must go early. In January, in Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-Wen introduced strict travel restrictions and quarantine controls for passengers entering from high-risk areas, resulting in just under  deaths in a country of nearly  million. But despite my strong impulse to declare womanhood to be the reason for this, the truth is maybe a little more prosaic. Perhaps being women simply predisposes them to having certain qualities required for good leadership ndash strong communication skills, empathy, honesty and trust. The aforementioned men are just sadly lacking in those.Leaders who were more risk averse at the thought of many deaths and who therefore took decisions to shut down whole economies will now be tested as economies begin to open up again. The criticism is that they have not been risk averse when it comes to the damage they have done to their economies.But it looks like the gamble to close down hard and fast in the hope that less damage might be done to the economy might just pay off. Germanyrsquos economy appears to be recovering and schemes like the Kurzarbeit programme, which allows workers to work reduced hours instead of being laid off, is expected to be extended by Merkel for  months to bring stability for workers, which the end of the UKs furlough scheme may not.In Scotland, Sturgeon is calling for furloughing to be extended, whilst clamping down on clusters of the virus and rule-breakers like a tough headmistress. In New Zealand, a quick economic recovery has been put on hold by Arden as she locks down again to eliminate, rather than simply contain, the virus.

Many who had seriously considered voting for independence ultimately recoiled from taking a step into the unknown and a future uncertain. But when our immediate andlong-term future is wreathed in uncertainty the perceived risks of self-determination recede a little.During the five months of lockdown many have found that those institutions they once looked to for security and stability have let them down or revealed to have been a mirage. They have seen officials at the top of the Westminster Government recklessly disregard lockdown restrictions with impunity and disregard for the safety of the nation. They have come to discover that being locked out of Britainrsquos affluence means you are three times likelier to die of Covid- than those you entrusted with your health and wellbeing.From the outset of this pandemic they have witnessed the worst excesses of the capitalist system that gives oxygen to the forces now telling them to preserve the Union at any cost. They now know that those who always tell them ldquowe are all in it together wasted no time in saying ldquoyoursquore on your own when super-rich shareholders demanded redundancies to protect their idends. At the first hint of trouble after years of massive profits the lowest-paid workers were first to be thrown overboard. And they know too that lsquoemergency fundingrsquo means large quantities of cash being handed to the families and friends of UK ministers for sub-standard protective equipment and no questions asked.Britain during coronavirus has been exposed as a vicious little gangster state and this is what George Galloway and Lord McConnell are being duped into defending.

Viridorrsquos energy recovery facilities are the sophisticated combined heat and power plants which use non-recyclable waste as the fuel to generate low carbon electricity and heat.The event, From Vision to Reality ndash converting Scotlandrsquos Circular Economy Leadership into concrete action to ensure we Build Back Better, attracted stakeholders across the Scottish government, SEPA, Scottish Enterprise, Zero Waste Scotland, local government, business and academia.Viridor CEO Phil Piddington said that Viridor, with its history of recycling infrastructure investment in Scotland, was working to be a key partner in ensuring Scotland achieves its goals.The company is also preparing a planning application to East Lothian Council for a plastics recycling and reprocessing plant at Dunbar which would draw heat and power from the energy recovery facility ndash essentially putting waste to work to power the recycling of more plastic within the circular economy.Mr Piddington added: ldquoWe recognise that these goals cannot be achieved by any one organisation. Success lies in partnering across business, government, academia and inventors to ensure Scottish resources are used and reprocessed in Scotland before being ed to local businesses creating a more circular economy. These partnerships move us from ambition to the practical reality delivering real results for the country.Viridorrsquos Innovation and Regulation Director Tim Rotheray said the event created the opportunity for Scotlandrsquos key stakeholders to come together and debate what is needed to move the Scottish circular economy beyond ambition.Dr Rotheray said: ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to continue these discussions and examine issues, such as how regulation and policy can drive both an improved economy and better environment.ldquoOur vision to support Scotlandrsquos circular economy would also feature a dedicated Circular Economy Innovation Centre. This could be a testbed for universities, start-ups and Scottish business to develop solutions to eliminate waste, by tackling the hardest to recycle products and putting partnership at heart of the vision.He said Viridorrsquos vision for the Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park had been designed to deliver both resource and energy efficiency.In a recorded message to the event delegates, Her Royal Highness, The Princess Royal said she was delighted to help launch the Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park ndash ldquoan important and practical demonstration of what should be happening.She added that the discussions, bringing together all sectors of society to ensure recycling was seen for what it is ldquoa valuable resource and not just rubbish were to be applauded.ldquoI am encouraged to hear that, in these challenging times, this vision matches innovation and investment with job creation, giving our young people the opportunity to play a major role in the world they will inherit.Dr Rotheray said that key workers in recycling and waste management had performed an essential service during the COVID- pandemic and now, the sector that is so vital to driving a better environment, also had the ability to answer the demand to drive a greener recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"complacency-not-option-running-time-says-clare-foster-shepherd-wedderburn","story":"The Covid- pandemic has received   media coverage across the globe, and with good reason. Coronavirus has had a catastrophic impact, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, devastating our economies, and materially changing the lives of millions as we try to adapt to the profound societal changes it has inflicted.Many will vividly rememberwatching Boris Johnston tell the nation on March : ldquoCoronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades.While there is no doubt that the particular challenge posed by Covid- is unheard of in recent history, and should not be diminished, I would take issue with the Prime Ministerrsquos statement. There is another threat that has been looming for decades, which is exponentially greater than coronavirus and poses an existential threat to humanity.Yet the climate change threat is failing to attract the attention ndash and action ndash it deserves.To put it into context, as Sir David Attenborough said last year: ldquoThe scientic evidence is thatwe have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies.This is a remarkable statement on a number of levels, but even more remarkable is the dference a year makes. The headlines about Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellionthat reverberated around the globe less than a year ago in the wake of the Australian bushfires and flooding in Venice feel like a distant memory, and governments and society have not reacted to climate change in the same way that they have to the Covid emergency.The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the ability of central banks, governments and agencies in multiple jurisdictions to move quickly, demonstrating that their inherent bureaucracy need not be a barrier to dynamic action when faced with an emergency of this scale.So why are we not treating climate change like the pandemic There are a number of reasons:From a UK business perspective, things need to change quickly to get the economy back on track, a point that is not lost on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. However, the UK simply cannotto le and business as usual.A green recovery is our best hope of rebuilding an economy ravaged by the Covid- pandemic and addressing the climate emergency. It should be a recovery focused on cutting emissions, investing in more sustainable, greener projects, creating jobs, and building a fairer and more resilient society.Why  Becausewe revert to the same bad habits that crept back in after the last financial crisis in then we will fulfil Attenboroughrsquos prophecy. The debate should not be whether the recovery should be green but rather how a green recovery is best achieved.It is important to remember it is not all doom and gloom, however. In the clean energy sector, eyes are firmly on a green recovery. There is huge appetiteto achieve the targets for offshore and onshore wind, as well as the other renewables technologies that will play a major part in helping us achieve the  and  net-zero targets set by the Scottish and UK governments respectively. The potential for job creation is enormous.In the financial sector, there is recognition that the funding requirements to achieve net zero are gigantic and that there needs to be a greater focus on investments that help tackle climate change. Recently, the Net Zero Investment Frameworkwas released for consultation.It provides the first practical blueprint for investors to maximise the contribution they make in tackling climate change and achieving net-zero emissions globally by . The framework focuses on the twin targets of decarbonising investment portfolios and increasing investment in climate solutions.The increasing importance of environmental, social and governancefactors and disclosure requirements means that sustainable investments are the way forward.Meanwhile, the oil and gas sector is playing its part too. At the beginning of August, BP announced its new strategy to transition to an integrated energy company and set out its net-zero ambition. It is the latest in a long list of oil and gas majors to have recognised that low carbon is the only viable future.Complacency is not an option and we are running out of time. The UK and Scottish governments have shown that when an emergency presents itself they are able to move at speed.If we are to try to address the climate emergency and the socio-economic effects of coronavirus with any chance of achieving the economic growth, employment and sustainable future required, we need to see that type of dynamic action again, not only from government but also from industry and society. I am up for that challenge ndash are you "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11681588.jpg?type=article-full","title":"co-op-iceland-sainsburys-waitrose-urgently-recalled-products","story":"Heres what each company has recalled.What have Waitrose recalled Waitrose  Partners are recalling Waitrose  Partners Chicken Satay with Sweet Chilli Sauce.This is because an incorrect dip has been packed in the product resulting in fish and peanuts not being mentioned on the label.It means the product is a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to fish and or peanuts.Product details:A spokesperson from the Food Standards Agencysaid: \"If you have bought the above product and have an allergy to fish and or peanuts, do not eat it.\"Insteadit to a local Waitrose store for a full refund.\"Alternatively contact Waitrose Customer Care on    and select Option .\"What have Iceland recalled Iceland has recalled their own brand Chip Shop Curry Chicken Breast Toppers and Southern Fried Chicken Popsters because salmonella has been found in the products.Product details:Name: Iceland Chip Shop Curry Chicken Breast ToppersName: Iceland Southern Fried Chicken PopstersWhy are Iceland recalling the products The chain have issued the recall over the presence of salmonella in the products.Symptoms caused by salmonella usually include fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.A spokesperson from the Food Standards Agencystated: If you have bought any of the above products do not consume them.\"Instead,them to the store from where they were bought for a full refund or contact Iceland Customer Care line on    and select option .\"What have Sainsburys recalled Sainsburyrsquos have taken thestep of recalling by Sainsburyrsquos semi-skimmed less than % fat  litre UHT milk.The supermarket says the recall is because of possible microbiological contamination that could lead to spoilage.

In truth, the famous thoroughfare had been leaching newspapers since the s but when Julie Welch landed a job there in , the presses were rolling at full tilt.Her entertaining new book describes the media epicentrersquos heyday, from the perspective of those whorsquod gained access to its hallowed newsrooms through talent and sheer hard graft ndash yet couldnrsquot even buy a drink in its most famous pub.Fleet Street Girls tells the story of ldquothe women who broke down the doors of the gentlemenrsquos club ndash not least, by winning a landmark discrimination case against the legendary El Vinorsquos refusal to serve women at the bar.As the first woman in Fleet Street to report on a football match, Welch was one of the conquistadors and the book combines her own recollections with those of journalistic luminaries such as Lynn Barber and Katharine Whitehorn. The result is a colourful evocation of the pre-digital and decidedly pre-MeToo culture that prevailed half-a-century ago, in fetid newsrooms where senior editors snoozed off liquid lunches amid clattering typewriters and rumbling subterranean presses.Welchrsquos largely anecdotal account is light on statistics, but itrsquos clear that for most of its history Fleet Street was a male preserve. Well, almost. In the late th century, Rachel Beer became the UKrsquos first female newspaper editor when she took over the reins of The Observer and later the Sunday Times.Assertive and fiercely intelligent, she was ldquoa woman with real power and therefore, writes Welch ldquoanathema to the staff and to distinguished contributors such as George Bernard Shaw, who became ldquospittle-flecked with rage when Beer made changes to his copy.She also engineered one of the greatest scoops in Fleet Street history, exposing the miscarriage of justice by which Jewish captain Alfred Dreyfus had been ly imprisoned for treason.Itrsquos not known whether Beer employed any women. There must have been some around because in , female hacks were being caricatured as sloppy, unreliable and deadline-shy in Arnold Bennettrsquos book, Journalism For Women. In a subsequent guide published three decades later, the author enthused about the ldquoenormous scope for female journalists, listing housework, fashion and ldquobeauty culture among the dazzling array of suitable topics.By the s, when the teenaged Julie Welch set her sights on a Fleet Street career, journalism remained male-dominated apart from a few dedicated ldquowomenrsquos pages. Lacking recourse to the copy boy apprenticeships that launched many male careers, Welch went to secretarial college to gain the typing and shorthand skills she hoped would get her a foothold.Astonishingly, to anyone familiar with todayrsquos sparsely-resourced newspaper offices, the rsquos history correspondent was advertising for a secretary. Although Welch didnrsquot get that job, her next application ndash for a clerical vacancy on the Observer sports desk ndash was successful. ldquoApparently there had only been one other applicant. She had a huge bust, so all the men said lsquoHire that onersquo.Thankfully, sports editor Clford Makins was more impressed by Welchrsquos track record. Having won the Daily rsquos Young Writer of the Year award as a student, shersquod been interviewed by Makinsrsquos old crony, Kingsley Amis. Nepotism was career currency on Fleet Street and mentioning the Lucky Jim author proved to be Welchrsquos lucky break.But name-dropping only gets you so far. Welch was an exceptional writer whoseprize ndash a job on the paper ndash had been scuppered by an unplanned pregnancy. Now that shersquod finally arrived in the ldquowonderful, human-sized board game that was Fleet Street, she used her talent and ingenuity to squeeze through the chinks in the bastionrsquos armoury.When she wasnrsquot phoning round pubs looking for writers whorsquod missed their deadlines or fielding calls from her bossrsquos many lovers, she was clocking up the occasional feature byline, eventually talking her editor into letting her cover a football match.ldquoWomen in the press box. So itrsquos come to that, muttered one of the assembled sports hacks, as she sat nervously waiting for the Coventry City v Tottenham Hotspur match to begin. ldquoThat was very good, said another, more kindly, after the whole pack had sat listening while she phoned over her report to the Observerrsquos copy-takers.Ah, copy-takers! Fleet Street Girls is full of gorgeous details about the newsroom paraphernalia of old. The overflowing ashtrays and huge typewriters on which copy was bashed out in carbon triplicate before being stuffed into tubes and sent to the machine room via overhead wires. The vicious metal spike on which unwanted copy was ldquostabbed to death. The libraries full of reference books and helpful staff.Innuendo and groping were perennial hazards. ldquoYou could almost smell the testosterone, recalls Wendy Holden of her time at the Evening Standard. Sly suspicions drted around any woman who achieved editorial status. Welch had won awards for her sports writing but when a football version of Private Eye was launched, she was horried to discover a comic strip titled Miss Julie. ldquoThere I was, caricatured, some of my most pretentious phrases lampooned, along with the implication that I slept with footballers. It was libellous, but I didnrsquot have the guts to call them out.Not all Fleet Street men were dinosaurs. The huge circulations of magazines like Honey and Cosmopolitan led many editors to try to ldquofeminise their papers and ldquoclear out the cobwebby old men. Meanwhile, Welch was grateful to the Observerrsquos Kilmarnock-born chief sports writer Hugh McIlvanney, whorsquod remind colleagues sore at being upstaged by a woman that ldquothe Lady can write most of us under the table.Welch clearly enjoyed being introduced by a radio DJ as ldquothe prettiest football reporter and writes fondly of an era when ldquoa young woman could charm her way out of speeding tickets. Nor were women alone in being disadvantaged. The prevailing Old Boy culture would have defeated most humbly-born males, and many of Welchrsquos interviewees were privately-schooled and well-connected. ldquoAwful, says Katharine Whitehorn of an early job on Womanrsquos Own. ldquoI had to interview girls in factories.For all the pressure to be ldquotwice as good as our male peers, Welch writes gleefully of the Fleet Street Girlsrsquo determination to ldquogo anywhere the men did, report anything hellip so that we too could make decisions about what went into our papers.And despite the groping, sexism and exhausting pace of work, it was, she suggests, a golden era. ldquoLove, fame, laughter, money, excitement were all there for the taking and we knew that once we left Fleet Street nothing would ever be so naughty, thrilling, so ground-breaking again.As newsrooms empty and more and more journalists toil remotely at laptops for ever-diminishing s, itrsquos hard to disagree."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-bridges-joins-plea-save-glasgows-stand-comedy-club","story":"Labelling Glasgows The Stand as the \"best comedy club\" he called for the Scottish Government to support the recovery of the comedy venue.Earlier we reported the Stands venues in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Newcastle were on verge of collapse after running up a pound, loss during the lockdown.:Flat in popular seaside town could be yours for poundKDirector Eva Mackay revealed the clubs are in need of urgent support in an email to supporters.Kevin took to social media to support the cause and plea for funding.He revealed he got his start at The Stand over  years ago.He wrote: \"Eva, Jane, Tommy etc helped me develop all the way through my career and itrsquos still the best comedy club in the UK.

It proposed further extraction of stone from the quarry as well as landscaping and restoration on the site.This was the second hearing of this application by the planning committee. A decision had previously been deferred, pending a site visit by councillors.Consideration was given by committee members to the proposal made by the development and infrastructure department, as well as the concerns raised by objectors. Reasons for objection included:After a y discussion, councillors chose to reject the application. This decision was led by Kirkwall East councillor, David Dawson, who was seconded by West Mainland councillor, Owen Tierney. The reasoning given for this was that the application proposed an extension which extended beyond the quarry#s defined mineral safeguard area, which Councillor Dawson and his colleagues felt was not justied. It was also felt that this extension would result in cumulative adverse impacts to residents living in nearby properties.Though this rejection was unanimously agreed by the planning committee, Kirkwall East councillor, John Ross Scott, formally lodged his objection to the decision taken by members after it had been made.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HIAL’s previous engagement on the ATMS programme has been on a face-to-face basis. However, Mr Matthew is working with local authorities to determine the best way to engage with community groups given the current restrictions due to Coronavirus.Reference Economic Consultants is currently contacting community representatives as part of the consultation process and Mr Lyon encourages those contacted to engage with the process saying: “It is important that local representatives contribute to the assessment of potential economic and community impacts.“HIAL looks forward to receiving the report with the findings from Reference Economic Consultants following completion of the consultation phase.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

However, Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort would like to reassure everyone that the health and safety of our team and guests remains paramount and that as a result of our own robust testing measures we identied two positive asymptomatic Covid- cases within our team.Both workers were said to be back-of-house and had no contact with guests, are continuing to self-isolate at home in line with company policy, and will be retested prior to their .Testing has been carried out to date on almost  staff, with random testing to continue as part of a full suite of safety measures already established.The statement added: We remain in contact with local government bodies and the Public Health Agency, who have been fully briefed on all our stringent hygiene procedures and who remain confident in the measures we have in place.The Contact Tracing Service , which we fully support, advises that we should not contact customers directly, this will be carried out by trained contact tracersnecessary.Our industry-leading safety measures continue to put the health and safety of all our guests and team members first and we have recently adopted additional, enhanced measures throughout the resort for further reassurance.The Northern Ireland Open is also to be played at Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort between September -, two weeks before the Irish Open.The Dubai Duty Free Irish Open was originally planned for the Mount Juliet course in Kilkenny in May. But it was postponed due to the pandemic.Restrictions from the Irish Government would have required US visitors to self-isolate for  days.Last week it was announced the tournament would instead take place behind closed doors at Galgorm Castle near Ballymena.This allows players to head directly to a UK airport, including those who will have competed in the US Open, which ends on September .Despite the new arrangements local golfing star Rory McIlroy has already ruled himself out, saying he had no plans to travel internationally in the coming months.The -year-old added: It might be dferentthere could be fans there and stuff, but it#s behind closed doors and it#s not an Irish Open like we#re used to it being the last few years, with obviously big prize funds and everything.

An employee at Danske Bank was even disinfecting a cash machine. People had a mixed reaction to the tightened guidelines, and whether the PSNI can or will enforce them.Judith Dickson from the town said she was worried about the rise in Covid- cases in the area but said it#s all our own fault.I think the guidelines will be enforcedthey can andthe police have the manpower, but I don#t think they do, she said. It#s up to people to report it but I don#t think they will.Gavin McCandless, who lives on the outskirts of the town, felt the temporary measures were necessary to keep everyone safe.Meanwhile, Sam Cree, who said he had the virus as far back as January, was in no doubt that a second wave was on its way.After developing a dry cough and losing his sense of taste and smell, Mr Cree was convinced he contracted Covid- but said he has fully recovered.He added that Mr Swann was correct in bringing down the gathering restrictions but was not impressed with the number of people visiting pubs.I just think there will be a second wave and people will have to learn to wear their masks going into shops, he said.Charlotte Weir and her friend Beverley Connor were much more critical of Stormont#s politicians and the PSNI in how they have handled the virus. Are there even enough police to stretch themselves that far and land at people#s doors  Charlotte asked. I just don#t think the politicians have a clue what they#re doing anymore to be honest.Beverley said: I don#t think there#s a chance the police will come in and enforce everything.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

We weren#t allowed to take the pin out of the hole to putt, we weren#t allowed to use the showers after the golf. We weren#t allowed to change in the changing rooms. All of these rules applied all of the time, added the politician.No drinks were served in the clubhouse without an accompanying order of food, as required under Covid rules.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There were plenty of smiles, but despite the blistering sunshine, the atmosphere was slightly muted. In any normal year there would have been giddy excitement, pupils slapping congratulations into each others backs. But this is education in a pandemic. The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park.

German bombers swarmed the skies. Belfast bore the brunt of a -strong Luftwaffe squadron, with  dead and , injured as a result. Seventy miles up the road, Derry was hit only once. It was not the Germans’ planned target. Thirteen lives were lost when a German bomb overshot its proposed target and hit Messines Park in Shantallow, home to a colony of ex-servicemen who had served in the Great War. Messines Park was named after the  Battle of Messines, in which the thDivision and thDivision had fought side by side. The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. googletag.cmd.push Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for pound,-- - pound, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around pound per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Trailing to Joseph Olowu’s early goal, the Candystripes were in trouble again, but hit back strongly in the second half with goals from Walter Figueira and Adam Hamill before James Akintunde sealed the win late on. The game started disastrously for Derry who conceded with the first attack on their goal just three minutes in, Kevin O’Connor’s high ball into a packed penalty area spilled by Peter Cherrie, allowing Joseph Olowu to capitalise, volleying the ball into the empty net to make it - to the visitors. googletag.cmd.push City were straight onto the offensive at the start of the second half two goals in three minutes turned the game on its head. City’s persistence finally paid off on  minutes as they got their equaliser and it was another goalkeeper error which led to the goal. Mark McNulty was unable to hold onto a high cross from Ciaran Coll and Jack Malone did superbly to keep the opportunity alive, pulling it back for Walter Figueira to fire home, much to the relief and delight of the home side. That relief turned to joy within two minutes as City turned the game on its head with a second goal. Again Meite was heavily involved, showing great strength and skill to hold off two Cork defenders on his way to goal. Meite seemed certain to score, but his effort was brilliantly parried by McNulty, only for the ball to roll across goal where Hammill was on hand to roll in his first goal for the club. googletag.cmd.push It took an extraordinary save from Cherrie to keep his team ahead in the last five minutes as the City goalkeeper somehow got his hand to Connor Simpson’s cross, clawing it off the goal line to save his team. The win was sealed with the very last kick of the game as James Akintunde collected the ball off Stephen Mallon and hooked the ball into the bottom corner to give the Candystripes a very valuable win. Teams DERRY CITY: Cherrie, Coll, Toal, Cole, Horgan, McCormack, Malone, Thomson , Hammill , Figueira , Meite . CORK CITY: McNulty, Olowu , Bennett, O’Connor, Fleming, Ochieng , Coleman, Slevin , Dalling, Simpson, Fenwick .

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

The weather in Northern Ireland was oustanding in April and May, which meant some form of payback was due in terms of lots of dull summer days, writes Ben Lowry. Picture: Michael CooperAnd sure enough we suffered payback. July was the dullest in NI in more than  years, according to Armagh Observatory. It was also wetter and cooler than average.August has been poor, particularly the last week. I associate late August with the onset of autumn.While the Mediterranean gets hot weather into October and southern England is warm until late September, Northern Ireland summers end early.My late uncle rented a house on the north coast in the last week of each August. I have happy memories of those trips but not of the weather. It has been wet across Britain and Ireland over the last week, such as at the Front Strand in Youghal, Co. Cork above on Wednesday.

There were growing reports of teenage parties after this time, because there is only so long that people will accept massive restrictionsThe chief medical officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael Maguire, said he would recommend such sweeping restrictionsCovid- infections hit  people per , .Robin Swann, the health minister, also gave warning that ato lockdown could not be ruled out,cases keep rising.Dr McBride, as a health official who lacks an elected mandate, was careful to say that it was not ultimately his call. He said that any recommendations would “need to go to the executive at the appropriate time for them to make a decision”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Now, however, western world politicians often defer big decisions to committees or experts, rather than make hard choices themselves.Even the supposedly radical Tory government in London, whichwants to shake up how the UK is governed, has hidden its pandemic decision making behind scientists.The A Level-GCSE fiasco is rooted in the cowardice that led to UK schools being shut earlier than the government wanted, and staying closed for longer.Even now teaching unions and other voices are trying to stop a fullto school next month, when in fact there should have been a push to get pupils back in the weeks after Easter– or at least exam years.There are four broad reasons why ato anything like the general lockdown we experienced after March  is not plausible.• The first is that the nation can’t afford to sustain the furlough schemeIt has already pushed debt to perilous levels. If furlough was extended into next year, there would need to be massive tax increases and spending cuts, including public sector pay cuts .NI politicians have no stomach for such toughness. Even in a financial crisis, Stormont seems only ever inclined to grant pay rises, including a huge recent teacher rise. Councils abused furlough by topping up Treasury funding of % of salaries with ratepayer cash to ensure no staff had any pay reduction.• The second reason lockdown is not feasible is the public mood. The UK government has been fairly criticised for the many things it did wrong over Covid, but few people cite thingsit got right. Its behavioural experts saidlockdown came in too early people would get fed up after a while, and begin to break it. That began to happen after two months. In June there were growing reports of young people socialising in groups .As well as fatigue with restrictions, people began to develop an instinctive sense of the risk of Covid, similar to how we assess car travel .• The third reason lockdown is not feasible is that infection levels do not justy such a massive response.Even the level cited by Dr McBride –  per , cases – is low according to some experts. Prof Carl Heneghan of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said epidemic level is five times higher .He said people were failing to understand, and balance, risks.Mr Swann and Dr McBride have accepted such balance over schooling .But such balancing equations should be applied more widely .Few politicians are candid that the Covid risk cannot be cut to zero.Sweden’s former state epidemiologist Prof Johan Giesecke said from the outset that it was not possible to halt Covid’s spread. Recent upsurges in case even in nations that were seen as models of control, such as Germany and South Korea, have vindicated that prediction. • The fourth reason another lockdown is not feasible is specic to NI: Bobby Storey’s funeral shattered Stormont’s authority. There was a cross-party determination to protect Sinn Fein . This meant the first and deputy first ministers cannot preside over press briefings that might reveal suspension of liberty.Instead, the political parties erted attention from the calculating nature of SF leaders’ social distancing breach on June  in westBelfast by backing probes into important but secondary matters such as PSNI and Belfast council handling of the funeral. But in the absence of sanction against hypocritical leaders who set the rules, the damage is irreparable. A population that for months largely obeyed lockdown, including missing funerals of loved ones, watched as republicans were allowed to do as they pleased.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Autumn in Northern Ireland always seems to arrive in late August——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

For those who believe they are immune they need to know better. This virus can and has taken lives”Minister Swann said recently his department recently has been dealing “with a signicant outbreak in a meat processing plant”.He said  cases were detected in staff and further cases of contact. He said all staff were being tested and many were self-isolating.Dr McBride added that “theof schools could see pressure on the R number”.“If your child has symptoms then keep them at home,” he added. “Get them tested. The capacity is up to  tests a day. Schools are not unsafe places.”The news came in the latest Department of Health dashboard - which also revealed that now , people have tested positive in Northern Ireland.In the last seven days  people have tested positive in Northern Ireland.There are no further deaths leaving the toll at .Most of the  confirmed coronavirus cases recorded in the past  hours by the Department of Health have been aged between -.Twenty-five of the  cases recorded were in that age range.The fewest cases recorded in the department’s latest update were between the ages  - and -.The latest dashboard reveals that the majority of the  cases of coronavirus confirmed within the last  hours were recorded in the Mid and East Antrim and Belfast council areas - both with .The remainder of cases confirmed in the Department of Health’s were located in:Antrim and Newtownabbey - Lisburn and Castlereagh- Newry Mourne and Down - Armagh Banbridge and Craigavon- Causeway Coast and Glens - Derry and Strabane - Mid-Ulster - The biggest increase in cases over a seven-day-period has occurred in Mid and East Antrim with  new cases.The dashboard also reveals there are active Covid- outbreaks in eight Northern Ireland care homes.That is an increase of seven from yesterday.An active outbreak is declared in a care home when a resident or staff member has a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of Covid-.The news comes as it emerges a meat processing plant near Ballymena is to close temporarily due to a Covid cluster.Cranswick in Cullybackey, which processes pigs, will shut at the weekend, the BBC have reported.A cluster is defined as  or more cases.

All children in Wales have had the opportunity to lsquocheck in, catch up and preparersquo before the summer holidays, and we hope this will stand them in good stead for the changes they are due to encounter in the upcoming months. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
