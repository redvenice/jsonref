For one whole year I was presented as a hermit hiding in Mexico but obviously I made a mistake and it all went wrong.I spoke to them both and I apologised.

I can’t think of a better replacement then Mr Charles. He looked very handsome. I was jealous, I wish it was me but thank God he was there.\u0027He said he still had not met Prince Charles or spoken to him on the phone but that he looked forward to \u0027thanking him\u0027 when he eventually met the royal face to face.Mr Markle\u0027s absence from the wedding shocked Meghan and was so last minute that his name was still in the Order of Service on the day.He said: \u0027She was beautiful.

Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said: “Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you”.’He added: ‘I was very proud. I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me (walking her down the aisle) but the whole world was watching my daughter.

I don’t have to, that’s my daughter.\u0027He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s upbringing, and how he and his ex-wife Doria were determined to not let their break-up affect their child.He said: \u0027We didn\u0027t express anger towards each other so she never felt that. Doria and I have always had a good relationship and she felt loved, there wasn’t a problem with that ever.\u0027Doria and I get along and we talk. I still bring her flowers every mother\u0027s day.

The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan! The Duchess of Sussex teamed her £4K Oscar...\u0027Promise me you\u0027ll never raise your hand to my daughter\u0027:...\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027:...Share this articleOf course, there will be some who think he should have kept his mouth shut, just as I did in the run-up to the wedding.But that was then, and this is now.After all the feverish speculation, rumour and gossip surrounding the chaotic furore of that week, it was good to hear the truth from the horse’s mouth – told in a soft, thoughtful manner that most of our viewers seemed to find endearing and sincere.The Palace, which had no prior knowledge of our interview, will have gone into spasms of horror that Thomas revealed Harry’s views on Donald Trump and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.After all, the royals are trained to never give their political opinions about anything.But Harry’s views – according to Thomas, he’s ‘open to the Brexit experiment’ and thinks President Trump should be ‘given a chance’ - seem more diplomatic than especially controversial.If I were the Palace, and Meghan and Harry for that matter, I would bite my tongue and try to see Thomas Markle’s interview in the way he intended it to be: a candid, honest account of what it’s been like to live through the blazing firestorm of life as a first time father-of-a-royal-bride.    Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/14/4D5C0CF100000578-0-image-a-10_1529329982999.jpg","title":"Prince Charles joins Queen annual Garter Day service Windsor Castle","story":"Share this articleLook charming in prints like Sophie in a dress by Emilia WicksteadShop the current collection at MATCHESFASHION.COMIt\u0026#39s been a busy few months for the Royal Family.

Pictured is China\u0027s President Xi Jinping\u0027China apparently has no intention of changing its unfair practices related to the acquisition of American intellectual property and technology,\u0027 Trump said in a statement Monday announcing the new action. \u0027Rather than altering those practices, it is now threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers who have done nothing wrong.\u0027 Trump added: \u0027These tariffs will go into effect if China refuses to change its practices, and also if it insists on going forward with the new tariffs that it has recently announced.\u0027The president said if China responds to this fresh round of tariffs, then he will move to counter \u0027by pursuing additional tariffs on another $200billion of goods\u0027.\u0027Do not fall for it, Mr President\u0027: Outrage as Ann Coulter...Brothers in arms: Trump keeps his promise to Kim Jong Un and...\u0027We have an orchestra here\u0027: What callous border is caught...\u0027If an American committed a crime that person would go to...Share this articleIn response to Trump\u0027s latest move, the Chinese Commerce Ministry accused the US of \u0027extreme pressure and extortionist behavior\u0027 and warned it would \u0027strike back hard.\u0027It wasn\u0027t immediately clear when the new tariffs could be put in place, as the trade office has yet to identify the Chinese goods to be penalized or conduct a legal review. The first round of penalties announced by both nations is set to take effect July 6.The intellectual property sanctions were the latest in a spate of protectionist measures unveiled by Trump in recent months that included tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the US and a tough rhetoric on trade negotiations from North America to Asia.The escalation in the dispute with China may also serve as a warning to other trading partners with whom Trump has been feuding, including Canada and the European Union.The move quickly drew praise from former Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon, who told The Associated Press: \u0027President Trump told China and the world tonight that America will not back down when it comes to economic aggression.\u0027  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was at the Detroit Economic Club when he said China\u0027s recent claims of \u0027openness and globalization\u0027 are \u0027a joke\u0027. He added that China is a \u0027predatory economic government\u0027 that is \u0027long overdue in being tackled\u0027But Wall Street has viewed the escalating trade tensions with wariness, fearful they could strangle the economic growth achieved during Trump\u0027s watch. Gary Cohn, Trump\u0027s former top economic adviser, said last week that a \u0027tariff battle\u0027 could result in price inflation and consumer debt - \u0027historic ingredients for an economic slowdown\u0027.Trump\u0027s comments came hours after the top US diplomat accused China of engaging in \u0027predatory economics 101\u0027 and an \u0027unprecedented level of larceny\u0027 of intellectual property.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the remarks at the Detroit Economic Club as global markets reacted to trade tensions between the US and China.He said China\u0027s recent claims of \u0027openness and globalization\u0027 are \u0027a joke\u0027.

She has been working at the Department for Education for eight months.In April 2016, Miss McDermott posted a picture of herself inside No 10 on Instagram, captioned: ‘My office for the day. My job is better than yours.’The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-level.Arriving on the ITV2 show in Majorca, she told her fellow contestants she ‘works in the government’.          The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’. All civil servants must uphold the civil service code – which says workers must show integrity and professionalism while away from government – while on a career break. If these terms were broken, human resources would be notified and would launch an investigation.However, workers who keep to the terms may return to work as normal. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/21/4D633CF600000578-0-image-a-14_1529355138016.jpg","title":"Now thats royal tea party Meghan Markels dress Queens hat Eugenies frock","story":"    Say cheese, Ma\u0027am: The Queen wears a hat to match a Wedgwood cheddar dish at the polo on Sunday¿I¿ve changed my mind about Meghan¿s dad ¿ he¿s just a shy,...Share this article    Don\u0027t put it in the dishwasher: Meghan in her plate pattern dress at a wedding on Saturday          Spot the inspiration: Kate channels the Polka Dot china collection by Royal Vale          Someone\u0027s blossoming: Pregnant Pippa plumped for the delicate look of a flowery teacup at the Royal Wedding          Saucer sorcery: Camilla\u0027s jacket at yesterday\u0027s Order of the Garter Service nods to the Royal Albert Black Diamond pattern          I\u0027m a little teapot: Princess Eugenie\u0027s poppy outfit is as chintzy as this pot          Roses are red...

Following his summit with Trump, Kim (both pictured) was expected to meet with Chinese leaders to discuss progress in halting his country\u0027s missile and nuclear weapons programs in exchange for economic incentivesJapan\u0027s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday there would be no changes to joint drill plans between the United States and Japan, both of which also engage in regular deterrence exercises against North Korea.\u0027The United States is in a position to keep its commitment to its allied nations\u0027 defence and our understanding is there is no change to the U.S. commitment to the Japan-U.S. alliance and the structure of American troops stationed in Japan,\u0027 Suga said in a regular briefing. The Pentagon has yet to publicly release the cost of previous and future joint military exercises with South Korea, a week after Trump cited their \u0027tremendously expensive\u0027 cost as a reason for halting them.Spending data for previous military exercises in Korea and elsewhere, however, suggest that the cost of a single exercise would be in the low or perhaps tens of millions of dollars in a U.S. military budget this year of nearly $700 billion.In response to repeated requests for cost data, Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, said: \u0027We are currently evaluating the costs of the exercises.\u0027Calculating the cost of military exercises is a complicated process, often requiring data from different branches of the military and spread over several budgets over different years.Troops who would have been involved in the exercises would still require training and certification, which would still cost money, said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia under President Barack Obama.\u0027To me, the idea of this as a cost saving measure doesn\u0027t really make much sense,\u0027 Denmark said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/07/4D65724B00000578-5859681-image-a-34_1529390785386.jpg","title":"Britains brightest students celebrate end exams Cambridges Ball","story":"    Two students  celebrate the end of the academic year a little bit too much as they get amorous in the middle of the road following a booze-fuelled May Ball          Students stripped off, hopped into inflatable boats and even leapt into the river (pictured) after an all-night party at the Trinity Great Hall, as they wandered through the cobbled streets, champagne bottles in hand          Some of the country\u0027s brightest thinkers and the leaders of tomorrow let down their hair for one night as they celebrated the end of their exams at Cambridge University\u0027s infamous May Ball          Three young men ditch their clothes and take a dip in the River Cam as they saw off the exam season in style on Monday night          Watch your step!A young lady and a friend hold onto each other for physical - and moral - support as they head home after a night of fun          The occasion is notorious for giving the young revellers a chance to frolic in the streets as they celebrate the end of their examsForeign criminal thrown out of UK for shoplifting four years...Brave Billy Caldwell walks out of hospital after taking...\u0027The world wants me to fail\u0027: Strict headteacher, 37, of six...Share this article    Still clad in dinner jackets, top hats and glamorous floor-length dresses, hordes of students teetered home arm-in-arm following the lavish event and prepared to carry on the celebrations with punt rides on the River Cam (shown)          Some of the students still swigged from bottles of champagne as they celebrated all their hard work on Monday evening          Three friends enjoy an after-party punt on the River Cam following a boozy five-course meal at the Trinity Great Hall          The lavish black tie ball is the biggest event of the Cambridge student social calendar and marks the end of their exams.

The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan!

Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/17/4D5DA37300000578-0-image-a-3_1529338336857.jpg","title":"Sourton church closes doors two weeks eight blue tit chicks nesting lectern|js slshare link","story":"    Daily life at St Thomas à Becket church in the village of Sourton, on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon, after blue tits were spotted flying around this decorative stand          When he shone his torch inside the carved holes he was amazed to discover a family of eight newly-hatched chicks insideCrumbling churches, graves and eerily empty streets that...EXCLUSIVE: Who\u0027s the daddy...? \u0027Peru Two\u0027 drugs mule...Share this articleSome services went ahead but were cut short and the organ was also put out of use.Members of the church community blessed the blue tits after each service and waited anxiously for news.To everyone\u0027s relief they were all freed and flew away about two weeks after they were first discovered.Local wildlife photographer Colin Sargent, who took pictures of the birds inside when they were almost fully fledged, said: \u0027Services were conducted by the Rev Adrian Brooks without the organ being played as it was too close to the lectern and they didn\u0027t want to disturb the birds.\u0027The blue tits were blessed after each service.\u0027The chicks are now fledged and, with a little human intervention and doors and windows left open, they have safely left the church to everyone\u0027s relief.\u0027The birds have now all left safely and it is a story with a happy ending as it was a big worry about how they would be able to get out the church.\u0027          Some services at the church (pictured) went ahead but were cut short and the organ was also put out of use. To everyone\u0027s relief the blue tits were all freed and flew away about two weeks after they were first discovered"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/12/4D5DF97600000578-0-image-a-17_1529322093218.jpg","title":"Meet building society boss gets 595 perks day thats 855k salary","story":"    Nationwide chief executive Joe Garner, pictured, enjoyed benefits such as a car allowance and private medical cover worth £217,000 - or £595 a day - in the year to April 4In the previous 12 months, the 48-year-old’s benefits package was worth £181,000.

Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          To be wrong-footed once as they were when the duchess\u0027s father announced he would not be giving Meghan away may be unfortunate. Pictured, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on their wedding    In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers.

Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.    Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/23/4D641D2F00000578-5858449-image-m-9_1529361093226.jpg","title":"Is bird Hilarious moment cockatoo barks dog New York City park","story":"A little dog became confused after a cockatoo started barking at him in a New York Park          The dog-like sound produced by Violet, the white feathered bird, made everyone laughWhat exactly is this?

A section of hydraulic cement tile – the once-ubiquitous flooring material used in homes around the city for a century or so from the mid-1800s – had been discarded during a home renovation.Cánovas picked up the tile, and a passion was born. Spotting tiles in dumpsters throughout Barcelona, Cánovas soon began to document his discoveries on Instagram as The Tile Hunter (@i_rescue_tiles).Hydraulic tiles first appeared in homes in Catalonia midway through the 19th century, and for decades they were a popular flooring material for middle-class families – cheaper than marble, but no less beautiful. To Cánovas, the tiles are a unique form of local art, each with a different geometric or floral design pressed atop layers of cement and sand.Today, homeowners are swapping out their tiles for modern flooring. Cánovas is on a crusade to save the tiles, which are no longer widely manufactured the old-fashioned way: by hand, using a mould, a hydraulic press and pigmented cement.When Cánovas started gathering tiles in 2014, he was a casual collector, picking up stray pieces that he would use to make end tables or picture frames. But after a feature in a local newspaper, his phone started ringing off the hook with tips from locals spotting hydraulic left in skips, or homeowners with entire apartments’ worth of tile that they wanted taking off their hands.“Now, it’s a responsibility,” he says. His collection today includes more than 30,000 tiles with 1,800 unique designs. After running out of space in his apartment, Cánovas moved his tiles into a small workshop in Gràcia but that space is now overflowing (“You can’t even walk in there”), so he recently expanded to a warehouse space outside of the city. Although Cánovas occasionally sells his tiles to cover the cost of renting storage space – he once shipped 1,800 tiles to an interior designer in Australia – he’s more interested in preserving part of Barcelona’s history than embarking on a retail enterprise.\u001fOnce a month, Cánovas hides tiles around the city and shares clues with his Instagram followers. The game, dubbed Tile Crossing, is like Pokémon Go for tiles, and the winners keep their findings. Cánovas plans to release a Tile Crossing app to facilitate the game and make it easier for his followers to drop a pin when they find tiles for him to salvage.“I think it will be the first app that serves solely to recuperate a part of our street heritage,” Canovas says. “These tiles aren’t thought of as part of our heritage, but they should be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39c2b77680c9105a923b0bb6c853b8eccc60d5b/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90fc91ba0a30e400dd39b21f27bc05a9 700w","title":"jeremy corbyn leftwing remainers brexit momentum labour live","story":"A Momentum petition launched at the weekend will force the party’s internal arguments into the public. It’s about timeLabour Live was conceived in the spirit of solidarity, optimism, and a playful hubris. The idea behind it presumably went: if you could get all of Glastonbury festival chanting Jeremy Corbyn’s name, who’s to say you couldn’t bring such a crowd to see him headline? Well, there were lots to say it. People at Glastonbury are largely in an incredibly good mood – it would be prim to speculate as to why – and in such conditions, someone you love a bit becomes someone you love a lot. But that doesn’t mean you can be relied upon to chant again.Primed for the fall after such an act of pride, Corbyn critics turned up ready for a soggy English summer’s day with sparse crowds huddled round a single Unite ice-cream van. A friend who went said she saw so many journalists it was like going to Hay. Yet many of the hacks will have been disappointed. Corbyn’s popularity – not by Survation poll or focus group, but by the sheer human warmth he generates – is unmatched by any other British politician. The doggedness and the petulance with which commentators wave away the fact that he could fill a stadium with people who’d actually paid, while Theresa May couldn’t half-fill a factory floor in Leicester where people were at work anyway, is becoming absurd.The faultline among Labour members is not whether this Tory Brexit is a shambles – thinly veiled racism vying with colonialist fantasy to see which can insist more trenchantly that the complicated is simple, a deficit is a idend, black is white. Most would treat that as a matter of established fact. The argument, rather, is whether Corbyn is best served on his route to Downing Street by everyone swallowing their objections and taking his lead, or whether, conversely, the argument on Europe is absolutely central to a socialist government, and that all of its values – from workers’ rights to the environment, from solidarity with the European left to the defence and enhancement of public services – would be kiboshed by even the softest of Brexits.The loyalists point to the MPs who use the remain or soft Brexit agenda as a means of returning the party to centrist hands. Those MPs are pretty transparent about it: Chris Leslie on Sunday launched his vision for centrist politics, which was mainly platitudes and occasionally a straight lift from Corbyn’s existing position – the message being, “Let’s not sweat the practicalities: politics is better when there are normal people like me in charge.” So yes, it’s a hiccup that the loudest anti-Brexit voice within the party also has no respect for its leader.Also, Labour’s soft Brexit proposition – single market membership with a side order of anti-immigration rhetoric to sate their imaginary northerner – is terrible. It serves the interests of capital while casually letting go of the European Union institutions that protected the inidual – the only thing the EU has going for it.However, plenty of leftwing remainers don’t want to be backed into silence by someone else’s agenda. Plenty of us do not swallow this great taboo around respecting a referendum result, when the campaign was built on naked lies (before you even consider Russian troll bots and what other rules were broken). Plenty of us would be savagely critical of the EU, but with the aim of reforming it, not abandoning it. Plenty of us want to see a Corbyn government able to enact its vision without the catastrophic recession that will follow Brexit, the social ision that’s already evident, and oh, tiny thing, the fact we need the closest possible left-European alliance to defeat the fascism that is plainly on the rise.There seems to have been a tacit agreement among pro-Corbyn activists, from constituency parties to Momentum, that respectable people avoid making problems for their leadership, and concentrate on local issues. That argument is starting to unravel, not so much evidenced by that splash of confrontation at Labour Live, but the Momentum petition that launched at the weekend: it called, in much more supportive language, for a conference vote on stopping Tory Brexit.If they get the signatures, the “democracy” aspect of party policy must be observed, and members must vote. It puts a logic bomb under the sense of apathy and inevitability: this is, in the end, a party committed to democratic renewal. It has to be ready for its debates to mean something. Labour in its “New” era was suffused with what psychoanalysts would call hysterical negativity, members having a mutually reinforcing bitch-fest with no prospect of effecting change. What a tragedy it would be if the Corbyn movement, in quashing debate for strategic advantage, became just Blairism with a beard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b4dba9602b955ae1147a82deeb1c3638026e549/0_99_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88192f5dc8adb39d6e7bcf4e40df58e3","title":"xxxtentacion hyperfast life of trauma inflicted endured","story":"The Florida rapper was famous for his brutality and celebrated violence in song gaining a fandom that didn’t seem to care about his crimesXXXTentacion lived a life of hyperfast, nihilistic violence where nothing could ever be put on pause. In the past year alone, he had a number one Billboard album, was banned from Spotify, dropped by his record label and charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant victim and witness tampering.His ex-girlfriend detailed the most horrendous abuse in court documents and press interviews. He will be remembered mostly for the unusually cruel violence he exerted on vulnerable people, particularly his ex-girlfriend, crimes for which he never expressed remorse.His music, a combination of hip-hop and emo that was depressive, and at times devastating, reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people’s and his own. On Monday afternoon, he was shot and killed in Miami, during an armed robbery. He was 20 years old.His life had many of the trappings of gangster rappers who were shot at a young age in the 1990s: drugs, violence and persistent trouble with the law. But XXXTentacion, real name Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, was not exactly a hard man. He was insecure and drug-addled, still living through his own traumatic childhood while he viciously abused others. His victims were not from rival gangs: they were women and strangers. His music rarely tried to demonstrate bravado or material gains, it mostly traced round mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny and a prevailing feeling of numbness.Onfroy, was born in Florida in 1998. His mother was financially unable, and at times just disinterested, in raising him, and he spent much of his childhood moving from home to home. The bond he had with her, he has repeatedly claimed, was incredibly strong. When she was in the picture he said she would shower him with gifts and affection. When she was away, a darkness and depression ate away at him, one that would define his short life.Onfroy was constantly in trouble for violent behaviour, and was at one point expelled from school for beating up another student. By the time he was 17, he had already been charged with possession of a firearm, armed robbery, resisting arrest and Xanax possession. He had done two spells in juvenile detention and during the second one, violently beat a cell mate who he believed to be gay. According to an interview he gave in the Miami New Times, when his mother asked him what had happened he said: “This nigga did some gay shit, so I had to crack his head open.”After he left juvenile prison, he began making music, mostly underground mixtapes with minor mainstream appeal. But in 2016 Onfroy’s profile started to rise thanks to the online success of his song Look At Me!, a track with violent lyrics that set the tone for that part of his career.Onfroy was part of a new wave of artists, sometimes referred to as “soundcloud rap”, whose music embodied a disconnect with societal norms, and embraced internet culture and heavy Xanax use. The role of Xanax, an addictive and potent pharmaceutical used to treat anxiety, was important – it helped to soothe internal pain, and created a floating disconnect from reality. The other shining light of Soundcloud Rap, Lil Peep, who Onfroy mostly loathed, died in November of a Xanax overdose. At the same time as his career was beginning to flourish, Onfroy entered into a relationship with a woman who he violently abused. According to court documents he variously stomped on her head, held her head strangled, kicked and punched her. He would also make repeated threats of suicide, often coming close to killing himself in front of her. Later, the woman became pregnant and Onfroy continued to brutally beat her and briefly kidnapped her. Onfroy was arrested for these crimes, as well as other charges and placed initially under house arrest and then in prison.While in prison Onfroy, became troublingly famous. A$AP Rocky tweeted that he couldn’t wait for his release and some accused Drake of copying one of his verses. When Onfroy returned to house arrest while awaiting trial, he began recording. He worked with Diplo, among other big names and eventually released two albums, the second of which “?” went to number one. It is a powerful record, performed in large parts on acoustic guitar, by a man desperately grasping to get something out of a life which he rightly senses might already coming to an end. He was lauded by giants of the genre including Kendrick Lamar. After his death Kayne West tweeted: “Never told you how much you inspired me when you were here thank you for existing.”Some lump Onfroy in with the #MeToo movement, and his music is discussed in thinkpieces about whether you can ever separate the art from the artist. But the truth is that Onfroy’s crimes are so unspeakably violent, his hate for women so unchecked, that they form their own category. Unlike other artists, whose violence against women became known once they were already stars, it was Onfroy’s incarceration for domestic violence that helped create his celebrity.In his final months, Onfroy was charged with witness tampering, and wasaccused of pressuring his ex-girlfriend to drop the charges against him. He made some attempts to rehabilitate his image, at one point claiming to donate $100,000 to a domestic violence charity – although it’s disputed whether he actually did. But the seriousness of his crimes he was accused of never seemed to register with him, and he would often return to violent language in the same breath as trying to clear his name. Onfroy idolised Kurt Cobain, saying he was “the only person who inspires me”. Cobain is often said to be part of the “27 club” a group of people who lived hard and fast, only for their demons to catch up with them at a young age. For Onfroy 27 would have been old age, his life contained so much trauma, inflicted and endured, that he barely made it out his teens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0c74236f07ca3441b0dae09222efd3698ceccd8/0_123_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13acdc5502088e2a95b97925dd95b6ae","title":"see the positives revisit old interests how to cope with an empty nest","story":"The children have gone to university. For some parents, the void that remains is harrowing others see it as an opportunity Louise Rodgers’s two children, 25 and 24, flew the nest several years ago – but they’ve come back at various times too. “Going to university is the first part of their journey to independence, and that can go on for quite a while these days,” she says. “It’s been several years of coming and going in a really lovely, delightful way, most of the time.”Rodgers takes a dim view of empty nest syndrome. “I feel it’s a little bit of a hark back to when women defined themselves by their status as mothers and wives. And I feel that we all have more complex identities than that now – mother is just one of them.” Not everyone feels the same way. Celia Dodd, author of The Empty Nest, says that for many parents it can be a wrench when children leave for university. Even when younger siblings remain, parents can feel a sense of loss. “I’ve got three and when each one went it was very painful,” she says. “It’s a person you’re missing, not a concept. It doesn’t matter if you’ve got 14 children or one child, that’s the essence.” The process of coming to terms with an empty nest can take time, says Dodd. “The first couple of weeks are hard, and it’s good to do things to cheer yourself up. Try not to constantly ring your child but to think about things you really like doing, because you gradually find out the nice things – that you don’t have to be in two places at once, and you can go for a drink after work, and you can meet your friends.” She suggests keeping a list of enjoyable activities, such as reading a good book, or going for a swim, that you can do when you’re feeling low. You may be tempted to become involved in your child’s new life by monitoring them on social media, but Dodd’s advice is to steer clear. “I don’t think it’s helpful – you need to wean yourself off. You’ve got to get on without them and you’ve got to let them get on without you as well. They will need your support for a long time but, to some extent, you should try not to badger them.”Some parents can become “very depressed”, says Sandy Wolfson, director of programmes, postgraduate psychology, at Northumbria University, and feel as though they no longer have a sense of purpose. “It’s very important for people in that situation to see the positives – that finally you can revisit some of the interests you had years ago but put aside when you were raising your children,” she says. Rodgers agrees. A friend saw the empty nest as an opportunity to throw herself into work, leading to a “magnificent promotion”. She herself chose another route, selling the PR company she ran and retraining as a business and personal coach. “It’s not so much about filling the gap as giving space to other things that you haven’t had time to do or to think about or to experience,” she says.Wolfson suggests it’s a good time to think about returning to study yourself. That could be anything from a short local adult education class to a full degree – what better time to take a course in a subject you’ve always loved than when you finally have time to yourself?For couples, this can be an opportunity to re-evaluate a relationship. Parents are often so used to relating to each other through their children that it’s very common for marriages to break down at this stage. On the other hand, Dodd says, research shows many couple relationships improve when the children leave “because you have more quality time and you can think about each other and focus on each other”.So it’s not all doom and gloom. Ultimately, says Dodd, you form a different, more adult relationship with your grown-up children. As Rodgers says of her own experience: “What greater pleasure than to see young people mature and do what they were always supposed to do, which is flee the nest? It’s what we should be preparing for.”Last October, the youngest of Bernadette Moore’s three children, Angus, left home to study history at the University of Nottingham. When the older two, now 27 and 23, had left home, it felt hard, because they took gap years in south-east Asia, which meant long periods without contact. University was easier. “It wasn’t too bad, because I could always hop on a train and see them, and I was able to call them much more regularly.”With Angus gone, Moore finally had an empty nest and some time to herself. “I’ve worked freelance since my children were little and I have devoted my life to bringing them up,” she says. “Everyone was saying: ‘What are you going to do when Angus leaves? You are going to be bereft.’” But although she dreaded it initially, when the time arrived, she found herself ready: “It was a big wrench but I really did enjoy the freedom. I wasn’t sitting around crying.” To make sure it didn’t hit her too hard, Moore made sure she was always out of the house doing something at 4.30, the time Angus normally came home from school, and they’ve stayed in touch with weekly phone calls. She has also kept herself busy – with a part-time psychotherapy course, which she had already started by the time Angus left, and organising an art exhibition, which involved travelling from her home in London to Manchester. The empty nest finally gave her the opportunity to travel as well. “I went to visit family all over the UK, and I went to see family in France. I honestly did enjoy my new freedom, because I’d had a child in the school system for 25 years.” On reflection, she says, the anticipation “is far worse than the reality. It’s not that bad at all.” Her advice to parents contemplating an empty nest is to “have things lined up, so you can get on and do them when they’ve actually gone, rather than sitting round thinking: ‘What am I going to do now?’” Having spent anxious hours worrying that her children haven’t returned her calls, she also cautions: “Don’t worry if they don’t ring you back. No news is good news.”Moore is very grateful for the years she spent looking after her children. But she is also very positive about what comes afterwards: “I have enjoyed this new stage of my life, and once you get used to it, it’s quite liberating.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b3163165ba4cfb681d7758bd54d08acf6e928a0/0_220_2244_3143/master/2244.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b2ad12e379b45dca8a5bbc9d879f595b 1440w","title":"best films of 2018 so far best movies of year","story":"The very best of 2018, from Black Panther rewriting the rules for superheroes, Gary Oldman going to war as Churchill, and Maxine Peake blazing her way through 70s sexism by Tamsin Bracher and  Andrew PulverRaucous thriller about the real-life 1973 kidnapping of J Paul Getty’s grandson, and the billionaire’s subsequent refusal to pay the ransom – a film that became notorious in its own right after reshooting scenes featuring disgraced actor Kevin Spacey.What we said: With the help of Plummer’s tremendous villain-autocrat performance, Ridley Scott gives us a very entertaining parable about money and what it can’t buy.Read the full review.Third in the powerhouse Marvel series, bringing together a whole gallery of comic-book characters including Doctor Stranger, Iron Man and Black Panther for an epic showdown with supervillain Thanos.What we said: Colossal, cataclysmic, delirious, preposterous – and always surreally entertaining in the now well-established Marvel movie tradition.

Its simple premise – three sets of parents frantically attempt to stop their children having sex on prom night – is undeniably compelling. Here is a “cock-block” like never seen before. What we said: It’s an entirely daft comedy, but its goofy rollercoaster energy and genial good humour keep it barrelling along, with many a bad-taste fiasco as our middle-aged, sex-obstructing adventurers experience quasi-teen nightmares of their own and come to terms with their imminent empty-nest sadness.Read the full review.Ben Stiller takes the lead in this light comedy, playing a down-trodden middle-aged man facing an existential crisis.

Welcome to the World Cup, Radamel Falcao.Aged 32, Falcao is a late entrant to football’s biggest party but better late than never in the eyes of Colombia fans. Rodríguez may have been the star of the show in Brazil, and he was certainly Colombia’s most influential player during their uninspiring World Cup qualification campaign for Russia, yet it is Falcao, the devoted Christian who has the power to win votes as well as score goals, who remains the country’s footballing icon.Falcao’s influence stretches far and wide in Colombia, so much so that when he was coming round from knee surgery in January 2014, after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing for Monaco, the surgeon who carried out the operation received a phone call from Juan Manuel Santos, Colombia’s president. “He told me that if I can get Falcao fit for the World Cup, then I could win him the elections,” José Carlos Noronha said.Santos stayed in power but Falcao, despite being named in José Pekerman’s initial 30-man squad for Brazil and spending 10 one-hour sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to do everything possible to accelerate his recovery, lost his race to be fit for the World Cup finals. Colombia were robbed of their talisman and Falcao was cruelly denied the opportunity to feature for his country in what was their first World Cup appearance for 16 years.As Falcao sat on the outside looking in, watching his teammates light up Brazil with the slick, incisive counterattacking football that delivered four straight victories and 11 goals before they ran into Brazil in Fortaleza, a couple of thoughts came to mind.The first was that if Colombia were this good without Falcao, what would they have been capable of if he were fit? The second was to dare to wonder whether Colombia, whose formation was reconfigured in the absence of Falcao, were possibly a better all-round team without him. Would Rodríguez, for example, have been liberated in quite the same way with Falcao in the side?Either way, there is no getting away from the fact Falcao endured a miserable couple of seasons when he finally did get back on to the pitch. Across 41 largely forgettable appearances for Manchester United and Chelsea between September 2014 and April 2016, after he was loaned by Monaco, Falcao scored only four times. Ivan Mejia, one of Colombia’s leading pundits, went as far as to say Falcao should be described as an “ex-footballer” towards the end of his time in England. Was Falcao finished?Two seasons back in Ligue 1, scoring 51 goals for Monaco, have provided the best possible response to that criticism and saw Falcao re-establish himself as the Colombia No 9 – a role Teófilo Gutiérrez filled in Brazil – before the end of the World Cup qualifiers and making him a mandatory selection for their opening game against Japan in Saransk on Tuesday.Shirts with his name on the back are everywhere. After Russia, Colombia are the third best supported nation at the World Cup based on ticket sales in their own country (65,234) and it promises to be quite an atmosphere inside the Mordovia Arena, where Japan will come up against the team who thumped them 4-1 in the group stage in Brazil, on a night when Pekerman rested the majority of his first-choice players because they were already through to the last 16.Rodríguez came off the bench to set up two goals and score another and it was interesting to listen to Akira Nishino, the Japan coach, talking at length about the Bayern Munich midfielder before this latest meeting. Nishino described Rodríguez as “almost like a symbol of the Colombia team – the mood-maker” and admitted he had given serious consideration to trying to man-mark him. Falcao, Colombia’s all-time leading goalscorer, never got a mention.There are some doubts about just how good Falcao and Rodríguez are together for Colombia and whether it is one of those partnerships and relationships that looks much better on paper than it does on the pitch. Pekerman seems to think otherwise and, reflecting on the make-up of Colombia’s squad compared with the group he had at his disposal in Brazil, spoke about a team “now much richer and much stronger thanks to the skills of our players” and of their “hopes to be at least as good or better than four years ago” when it comes to ambitions for the tournament.Rodríguez, who has been struggling with a calf problem, is a slight doubt for the Japan game, although the expectation is that he will be fit and get the chance to add his name to the select group of players who have scored in six successive World Cup matches. Falcao, in contrast, is just about to get started."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3227073a2bdb6fe7ece3b99f124f15348a9f1d8/0_137_4123_2473/master/4123.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1cded7810279a7d96d55e86cd3c3f8d","title":"harry kane talismanic captain two goals tunisia","story":"Oh, Harry. At the end of a fraught, at times puzzling World Cup Group\u0026nbspG opener there was an unfamiliar noise around the Volgograd Arena, an odd feeling of lightness in the air, a feeling of double-take. It took a while to register. Applause. Relief. A skirling of possibilities. England tournament moments: also available in happy.It is fair to say Harry Kane did not just save his England team by heading the winning goal in the last desperate knockings of this 2-1 defeat of Tunisia. In the process he rescued us all from the heavy weather, the unbearable introspection of another slow first‑week World Cup death.Some will call this a lucky win, papering over the same old flaws, those moments when England just shrink, the players lashed to the oars of some invisible Roman slave galley, dawdling the ball tortuously back and forth. But then, good players take those moments. And here Kane did\u0026nbspthe decisive, destiny-shaping thing twice, finding a moment of space and stillness in the most fraught of penalty area scrums.In the process he scored from three yards out at both ends of the game, one with his right foot, the other with his head in injury time.

Instead they managed to miss not one, not two but three just‑kill‑me‑now open goals, although the first was flagged offside and would not have counted.That miss was the worst. With three minutes gone a lovely little knot of passes left Raheem Sterling in front of goal, all on his own, ball at his feet. Sterling did not just miss it, he double-missed it. He seemed to be trying to tap dance on top of the ball, to ride it like bicycle, striking it with both feet while haring in at top speed in such a way the ball was left trickling with a sickly, taunting little roll wide of a post.Next was Jesse Lingard who side‑footed an ugly, creepy, ungodly looking thing wide of another open goal. Finally it was the turn of John Stones who wafted at thin air from five yards out.Thank heavens, or indeed Mauricio, for Harry. In the middle of this Kane was a blur of intent, dropping deep, playing as both a No\u0026nbsp10 and a No\u0026nbsp9. Shortly after Sterling’s miss he had a shot deflected for a corner. The kick was headed at goal by Stones, then palmed up into the night air. There was a weird moment of stillness as the ball fell in front of Kane, very slowly, looking unusually white and pristine. And then with snap the day was rushing on again, Kane king the ball home to a great gurgling roar of joy.The Volgograd Arena is a striking thing, rising up suddenly out of the low skyline like a giant, lighted wicker basket at the foot of\u0026nbspMamayev Kurgan, the plateau above the city. Around the bleachers\u0026nbspbefore kick-off there was\u0026nbspthe usual pageantry of these summer mobilisations, a journey around the isles in hand-painted flags, from Rochdale to Southend to Stoke, up the Tyne, Forth and\u0026nbspCromarty.Leading up to this game there had also been a gathering intensity around Kane, who was so poor, and so tired, at Euro 2016 but who is 24 now and who really does need to score if the gears and parts of this England team are to function.Kane will have felt it too, from the\u0026nbspexaggerated reporting of his every statement in the buildup to the sudden nostril-close tunnel shots from the TV camera before kick-off on a hot, heavy night by the Volga, bringing those likeable, agreeably droopy Kane chops into Soviet‑scale close-up for the watching global\u0026nbspaudience.He will have felt it, too, as the game began to slip away, even before Tunisia’s equaliser from the spot. As the second half kicked off a kind of congealment seemed to have settled over England, like a bowl of\u0026nbsplukewarm rice porridge left to glaze in the open air. Suddenly the band were back in the stands, battering away with a horrible deadening throb. England had possession but it was slower now. Kane ran still but he always seemed\u0026nbspto be chasing or being shunted away from goal.He was hugely unlucky not to be awarded a penalty after being grappled to the floor. But it is to be hoped England’s analysis does not focus on the referee or perceived injustice. There is no right to blame anyone but oneself after spurning the chance to score four goals – and not just gilt‑edged invitations to score but scented and vellum‑inscribed, hand-delivered by a unicorn-train of footmen.Then there was England’s shape, that honed five-man defence which\u0026nbspat times in the second half looked absurd with just Wahbi Kazhri puffing around in between them, like sending a swat team to surround a stray dog while at the other end of town there is a robbery going on.Towards the end there was the slow descent into anxious lateral movement and finally that moment of pure, high‑grade Harry that will leave England unexpectedly\u0026nbspbuoyant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90ac717d2dd461ed67bccc48ce0fc3b037293f9/0_50_2633_1581/master/2633.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9a5a05c2e4828ac81d0108a5685672e","title":"russia world cup 2018 knockout stage egypt ussr 1986","story":"Victory over Egypt will put Russia on the brink of their first World Cup knockout game since the Soviet era, but the squad have not forgotten the widespread pre-tournament pessimismIt has been a long time since Russia’s national team have given their country something to cheer. But now a side billed as the worst in a generation stand on the verge of a minor piece of history.Russia are one win away from something they have not done since the Soviet Union days: reaching the knockout stage in a World Cup.There are some caveats. Yes, their first win came against a hapless Saudi Arabia. Yes, Russia’s group is probably the weakest, with Uruguay dark horses at best to win the tournament. And yes, Egypt have Mohamed Salah.But before the crucial match against Egypt on Tuesday a few fans are daring to dream of making progress for the first time since 1986. “I remember being a boy when they made it out of the group and I swear I’m feeling like a child again,” said Pavel Krasovsky, a Russia fan entering the Luzhniki Stadium to watch Mexico’s 1-0 defeat of Germany. He was with his son Misha, 10, who wore a Russia jersey and had decorated his cheeks with the Russian tricolor.It was a talented side in 1986 dominated by players from Dynamo Kyiv (now in Ukraine) that went out in extra time to Belgium in the last 16. In vivid detail Krasovsky could describe from memory the Vasily Rats wonder goal from 30 yards that saw the USSR draw 1-1 with France in the group stage of the tournament, held in Mexico.He said he felt the same electricity – well, perhaps at a slightly lower wattage – when Aleksandr Golovin sent a free-kick curving round the Saudi goalkeeper Abdullah al-Mayouf to make the final score 5-0, an exclamation point to a day that exceeded even the most jaded Russia fan’s expectations.There are few moments that Russian fans can point to as triumphs, the last coming a decade ago when a young Andrey Arshavin led the side to a surprise 3-1 victory against the Netherlands in the Euro 2008 quarter-finals. Fans thronged out of the bars on to the Moscow and St Petersburg streets, where the party continued until dawn.Tuesday may also turn out to be a pivotal moment. “The game against Egypt is extremely important for the national identification of Russian football … you can’t imagine how important it is,” said Igor Rabiner, a popular columnist for the Russian paper Sport Express.It is a team that have had a tortured relationship with the sporting press and their own fans, who seem peculiarly talented at denigrating their own side. “Before the tournament the Russian team was very underestimated by the Russian fans and the media,” Rabiner said. “Actually I’m a little bit surprised that the national team continued to speak to the media at all because it was a really bad attitude from the press and from the fans.”Yet talk they did on Monday, crossly at times, as western and Russian journalists questioned the manager, Stanislav Cherchesov, and goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev in St Petersburg.“Of course our mood is good,” Akinfeev said in one of his more genuine moments. “When there’s a good result, people are positive, there are pleasant jokes, a feeling of freedom. It’s a bit easier now and I hope it will continue. Everything depends on us. We will try to keep our good mood for our players and our fans. We need to unite.”But the two looked irked, as though they had not forgotten the attacks from the press that led the Russia striker Artem Dzyuba to ask them publicly to tone down the criticism. Irritation showed in particular when a journalist asked, perhaps for the fifth time, whether Russia have a special plan to deal with Salah. “First of all I’m going to tell you about my team because I believe that we should pay more attention to the Russian team where I play,” Akinfeev said. When another journalist tried to lure him out on Salah, he said it would “not be correct” to talk about Salah apart from Egypt as a team.“We understand that we’re not going to be playing against mannequins,” Akinfeev added.Cherchesov was more curt when asked how he would stop Salah. “I believe in my team and my players,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/408ee0061c1c71055232c195078947ce008cb1bd/0_111_2782_1670/master/2782.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e74e86bc7d6c6382edf8e122728ab1db","title":"tunisia england world cup match report","story":"The clock had ticked past 90 minutes. Harry Kane was there and, in that position, Gareth Southgate could not have wished for any other player to be primed inside the penalty area. An old English routine: the corner, the flick-on, the back-post header and, suddenly, England’s opening game of the World Cup had its happy ending.It was deserved, too, bearing in mind the pattern of the game and the long spells when it had been threatening to finish with a churning sense of déjà vu. England, after all, had managed only five wins in their opening fixtures of every World Cup and European Championship since 1950.They had outplayed Tunisia without outscoring them and, at 1-1, a draw would have pained Southgate, to say the least, given the number of chances his team had passed up to make it a more straightforward evening.But when has it ever been straightforward with England? Kane had already scored from one corner and the team had played so thrillingly it was bordering on absurd that\u0026nbspthe game had reached the end of normal time without them being in a winning position.Tunisia’s equaliser had come from a penalty that could be described, at best, as generous – or from England’s perspective, utterly needless – and for a long time it seemed as though Southgate’s players did not have the wit or creativity to turn their superiority into the hard currency of goals.Enter Kane. His late, twisting header means England can qualify for the knockout stages by defeating Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday and the final game of Group\u0026nbspG against Belgium may not be so relevant. England can therefore leave Volgograd reflecting on a hugely satisfying evening, full of drama and incident, and nobody can possibly argue the result was unjust. England were the better team by some distance, even if they did play with everyone’s\u0026nbspnerves.Mouez Hassen Denied Lingard and was unlucky after his save from Stones rebounded to Kane, before injury forced him off early. 6Dylan Bronn Good marauding runs down the right flank by the wing back but sloppy defending. 6Yassine Meriah Couple of decent tackles in first half overshadowed by a hopeless backpass and manhandling of Kane. 5Syam Ben Youssef Excellent tackle to deny Kane in the second half but could not keep hold of the striker in the end. 6Ali Maâloul Coped well with England’s wide men, not much opportunity to show his set‑piece ability. 6Fakhreddine Ben Youssef Made the most of being hit by Walker’s flailing arm for the penalty but his manager will not have minded the theatrics. 6Ellyes Skhiri The French-born defensive midfielder a recent recruit to starting XI, struggled to assert himself. 5Ferjani Sassi Good penalty to even things up but lucky to get away with a rugby tackle on Kane in the box. 6Naïm Sliti Tunisia’s most naturally talented attacker did well with ball at his feet, frustrating England with inventive play. 7Anice Badri Quick feet, did not get much service and caught in possession several times. 6Wahbi Khazri Squandered the chances he had, hitting one so high it may have flown over the Motherland Calls statue. 5Ratings by Martha Kelner.Southgate certainly kept to his word that his players would deliver fluid, energetic performances with an emphasis on attack. They were quick to the ball, slick with their passing and attacked with so much adventure, particularly in the first half, that there were countless occasions when they outnumbered their opponents at the back.The pressure on Tunisia was almost unremitting and, even ignoring for a moment Kane’s goals, it must have been hugely encouraging for Southgate to see the vibrancy of his team, the number of chances they concocted and the desire of the midfieldersto break into the opposition penalty area.Unfortunately for Southgate, there was also a reminder here of England’s recurring ability to make life more difficult for themselves than necessary. On that front nothing has changed. It was difficult to keep a count of the number of chances – not just half-chances but wonderful openings – England totted up throughout the night.How much less stressful everything might have been, for instance, if England had been more ruthless inside the opening few minutes.Jordan Pickford Only real test for the 24‑year‑old was penalty on 35 minutes to which he got fingertips. 6Kyle Walker At fault for the penalty, with foul on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. A soft decision but naive defending. Booked. 5\u0026nbspJohn Stones Should have scored with a header in first half and lost concentration at key\u0026nbspmoments. 6Harry Maguire Assured passing but lost ball in dangerous areas and would have been punished by a better side. 6Kieran Trippier Lovely balls whipped in from the right and caused Tunisia problems with pinpoint delivery from set pieces. 8Jordan Henderson Preferred to Eric Dier and gave a good account of himself in so‑called midfield pivot\u0026nbsprole. 7\u0026nbspAshley Young A few incisive deliveries into the box and oldest player in England squad set up the first goal. 7Jesse Lingard A litany of missed chances as he failed to make Tunisia pay for England’s early dominance. 6Dele Alli Tottenham forward looked lethargic at times, whether through injury or lack of fitness. 6Raheem Sterling Sparky in the first half but the question mark over his finishing ability remains. 6\u0026nbspHarry Kane Kept cool to head in England’s winner – his second goal – and composed despite being repeatedly fouled in the area. 8\u0026nbspRatings by Martha Kelner.An offside flag spared Sterling’s embarrassment with an open-goal miss after four minutes. It was a fairly staggering moment, all the same. Yet in fairness to Sterling he was not the only England player to be guilty of poor finishing during a wild, breathless opening half.One by one, the chances came and went. Jesse Lingard had a golden opportunity, at 1-0, to double England’s lead and, later on, prodded a shot against a post.John Stones wasted a gilt-edged chance shortly after Tunisia’s penalty, with Dele Alli’s looping back-header being turned against the crossbar moments earlier, and there was some splendid goalkeeping from Mouez Hassen before he was forced off with a shoulder injury.Hassen had stopped Lingard from giving England the lead after only two\u0026nbspminutes and Tunisia’s goalkeeper was unlucky for Kane’s first goal, 11 minutes in, when Ashley Young delivered the corner and Stones showed great desire to get to the ball first. Hassen clawed away Stones’ header but the ball fell kindly for Kane and he turned in the rebound from close range.All of this seemed a far cry from the last time England were seen in a major competition, namely the ordeal against Iceland in Euro 2016. Southgate’s men\u0026nbspset off like a team in a hurry. They have had to be patient, with six of the other World Cup groups already under way,\u0026nbspand it quickly became apparent they were determined to make a favourable impression.Once they had the lead, however, they were far too slack in letting Tunisia back into the match through a combination of penalty-box misses, some bad luck and the penalty that Kyle Walker gave away for blocking off Fakhredinne Ben Youssef in the 34th minute.England are entitled to be aggrieved by the decision of the Colombian referee, Wilmar Roldán, and the exaggerated agony of the Tunisia player to create the deception. Equally it should be a lesson for Walker that in the modern international game it is taking a risk to jut out a trailing arm when an opponent is in close proximity.Walker has a habit of disrupting players this way and on this occasion it backfired. Ferjani Sassi took the penalty, beating Jordan Pickford to the goalkeeper’s right. And England were back level again in a game they had been controlling.They should have won a penalty of their own when Kane was pulled to the floor in the same incident that led to Stones firing wide and, after the interval, England continued to press\u0026nbspforward.Sterling, with only two goals now in 38 England appearances, was taken off in that period and his replacement, Marcus Rashford, quickly started to threaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who came on after Alli complained about soreness in a thigh, also had a positive impact and, importantly, England kept going.Even when the ball was not running for them, they persevered. And then, finally, came the decisive corner in the first minute of stoppage time. Kieran Trippier put the ball into the penalty area. Harry Maguire won the first header. And Kane was there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bbd40640766388ce342af7a4ae5880d9c17546/0_260_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d180055e2dd495afd57f54e510ce93ad","title":"arsenal bayer leverkusen bernd leno","story":"Arsenal have agreed a deal to sign Bernd Leno for an initial €22m (£19.2m) from Bayer Leverkusen.The 26-year-old, who was part of the Germany squad which won the Confederations Cup last year but was not selected for the World Cup, is expected to sign a five-year deal at the Emirates after he was identified as the long-term successor to Petr Cech.

After crashing to a 5-0 opening defeat against Russia, they meet Uruguay on Wednesday:Once the dust, and midges, had finally settled in Volgograd, there was another result to be had between a few of the usual, and more unusual suspects. On Twitter, there was Gary Lineker v Piers Morgan, part XXXIII, and Alan Shearer v ... Simon Schama. Lineker and Morgan exchanged the usual barbs, but the former probably came out on top in that Group I opener, labelling Morgan a “hacker”. Not in Russia, but soon to be at Arsenal. The 26-year-old goalkeeper was left out of Germany’s 23-man squad for the tournament:It’s coming home, isn’t it? England beat Tunisia in the best manner possible, especially if you were one of the many thousands bobbing up and down, limbs haywire in front of a big screen at the pub, a projector or at a mini fan-zone. From Leeds to Bristol and beyond, Harry Kane’s winner was priceless, for three points, for the rest of this week and perhaps the rest of the tournament in Russia.  If it had been 1‑1 there would have been a level of disappointment, and the result back home would be viewed differently, but the performance was very good. Maybe you run out of time, but we kept doing the right things and making good decisions. We had leaders on the field who kept delivering the right messages. We spoke this morning and covered being behind and in front in games, how we’d react being 1-1 with 15 minutes to go, and we had to keep probing and look for the win while not exposing ourselves on the counter … and good teams score late.It’s time for me to handover to my colleague Ben Fisher and ride off in to the antipodean sunset. Thanks for your company and apologies to those whose emailstweets etc I couldn’t include. Enjoy day six - to think we’ll soon be 1764 games down and Russia 2018 will be very much well on its way it’s happening too fast!And speaking of physicality, some interesting comments out of the Australian camp ahead of their do-or-die second group match against Denmark, here’s Reuters:The Socceroos believe Denmark is a mirror-image of themselves in terms of game style: physical, pragmatic, team-orientated.“They are quite similar to ourselves in the way they set up and the way they go about things,” Australia defender Trent Sainsbury said.“So it will be interesting to come up against a mirror.” The contrast presumably being that the artisans of France were more cultured than their pragmatic first-round opponents. No pressure on teammate Tom Rogic but, he’s just been liked to Christian Eriksen.An interesting side note that came out of yesterday’s Sweden v South Korea result was the confession from manager Shin Tae-yong that his side were “psychologically” intimidated by the larger Swedish team.It’s a phenomenon Australian sides have certainly looked to exploit in AFC qualifications against East Asian nations, with Australia’s historic first-ever World Cup win coming against a Japanese side in 2006 that was subjected to a barrage of high balls as the then-Oceania representatives chased a late winner.With Japan in action against Colombia today you wouldn’t imagine such an issue will arise, but perhaps for their second round match against Senegal, physicality could become a factor (especially if both sides are left winless after the opening round).Anyone who watched Mexico v Germany however would assert that giving away a significant height disadvantage means nothing if the heart is willing so has South Korea rolled out the white flag already on this front?Incidentally, no pressure on Poland - but thus far at Russia 2018 every single team from Europe remains undefeated, except for, oh, the defending champions Germany. It’s a remarkable start for Uefa in the battle of the confederations - can the Poles make it 1314 today?Conversely, Senegal will be battling for pan-African pride, with all four African nations losing their opening matches, which doesn’t bode well for them, if you’re particularly superstitious.Iran flies the flag for Asia, having won their opening match. A relief for the world’s most populous region after it’s four representatives at Brazil 2014 won 012 of their group stage matches. Japan will look to match that result you’d imagine for East-Asian pride.And but for Mexico’s upset result it would have been no wins from Concacaf, while Uruguay provide Conmebol’s solitary opening round win, an achievement Colombia will look to match today as well.And to continue our tactical previews of Group H’s second match, and the final ‘first look’ at sides at the World Cup.Meanwhile, to humour our good friends waking up across England this morning, we promise we won’t over-hype the opening Three Lions’ result only to establish the perfect terrain for the inevitable come down. But for even the most cynically hearted you can’t deny this is a nice sight:Let’s turn our attention to the first of today’s three matches, Colombia v Japan, where if your knowledge of these two is a bit rusty, rest assured we have terrific squad previews courtesy the  experts’ network.Returning to VAR and it’s first week assessment:Our below the line commenter ‘USfan’ has the following contribution.I’m pleased we are talking about VAR. The alternative was talking about all the games ruined by the lack of VAR, which is what we usually do.France-Australia was put right by VAR. VAR was key to protecting the integrity of Peru-Denmark (even if Peru didn’t convert their penalty, it would have been massively unfair to Peru had it not been given, and their fans would understandably have felt robbed). It’s even good they reviewed incidents like Costa’s goal against Portugal.Seems a pretty reasonable take. Although if it was anyone else in world football apart from Pepe perhaps Costa’s contact might have warranted a different outcome.Snap poll, then - would you rather argue about a subjective interpretation from the seemingly objective VAR or the injustice of a simple error from a human referee?I for one would never wish to have not experienced the sheer splendid drama of Graham Poll v Jo Simunic at Germany 2006, which no doubt the humourless VARs would have nipped in the bud.By the end of the day we will also have got our first look at all the candidates for the Golden Boot race.611 of our  writers tipped Neymar or Gabriel Jesus to win pre-tournament, but are you ready to write off either Brazilian after their showings against Switzerland?Cristiano Ronaldo may not have featured too prominently in many people’s reckoning given Portugal’s relative standing vis-a-vis the big favourites, but has the five-time Ballon D’Or winner already laid down a significant marker with the 51st hattrick of his career against what is on paper Portugal’s toughest Group B opponent?His former national team coach, and club coach with Manchester United, Carlos Quieroz may be hoping not, as he looks to build from his side Iran’s opening win against Morocco.Another significant talking point that was always going to rear its head, given its World Cup debut in Russia, is the introduction of video assistant referees or VAR.Designed to correct the more egregious examples of human error, is the system in its current format not just equally as subjective, given it’s hazy brief of correcting “clear and obvious errors”?So almost a full round of matches in - what are your thoughts on video technology? Presumably this aligns a lot with how your team has fared thus far, as I don’t imagine South Korean or Australian fans will be knocking down my door with fervent praise for our new robot overlords.Sean Ingles draws an interesting parallel to the introduction of new rulings surrounding the backpass in the Premier League ahead of the 1992-93 season. Do you agree with him?As we approach the conclusion of the opening round of group stage matches today it is perhaps the headline talking point - the somewhat underwhelming first showings of the so-called ‘favourites’.Plenty of champion sides have built slowly into major tournaments - but is there any grounds to press the panic button for fans of Germany, or even Brazil, Argentina or Spain?The German press were certainly less than enthused with what they saw against Mexico:With Barney Ronay’s in-stadium assessment damning of Germany’s most un-German of characteristics, appearing disorganised.Indeed, with three of the last four tournament champions suffering the indignity of losing their opening game it prompts the question of whether basic psychology has cracked that most resolute of barriers, die Mannschaft.Was Thomas Müller, Mesut Őzil, Mats Hummels and friends, dare it be said overconfident or even arrogant going into this one? Joachim Löw’s fashion certainly was.One thing’s for sure, it makes for a fascinating resolution of matches in Group F, where on too many occasions in recent years we’ve seen favourites coast through near dead rubbers in game three.Now much has already been discussed regarding England’s win this morning, with a bunch of solid talking points emerging from the match, as Dominic Fifield has expertly surmised:But as Peruvian fans (or dare we also suggest Australian fans?) will attest its a game of the finest margins, football, so can you ever really put your finger on which particular “one per center” gets a side across the line?Germany’s travelling cohort certainly had grounds to be aggrieved, with effort’s like Julian Brandt’s late rocket or Toni Kroos’ freekick so agonising close to drawing parity.But consider the following:and now this:Tell me that’s not a crucial “one per center”.And while Real Madrid has been busy trying to scupper its nation’s World Cup chances crosstown rivals Atlético have been going about their business with less ructions: announcing the signing and re-signing of three of France’s stars.Star striker Antoine Griezmann and defender Lucas Hernández have signed the dotted line for extended stays, but it’s the signing of promising Monaco winger Thomas Lemar that has tongue’s wagging. €60m (£52.7m) is the mentioned price. I wonder how many cut-price Nikola Kalinić’s you can get for that.So let’s wrap up some news the big talking point from late yesterday was of course Croatia’s Nikola Kalinić getting sent home for apparently refusing to play in their World Cup match against Nigeria. You wonder how that goes down with professional footballers around the world. I’m sure a plane ride shared with somebody like Ryan Giggs might remind him how special an opportunity representing your country on the biggest stage of all is.And speaking of plane rides, a positive outcome for a team beset by a very unwelcome distraction, with Saudi Arabia’s players all safe and sound after their plane caught fire, en route to Rostov-on-Don.And you thought their opening fixture against Russia was harrowing.Finally, some positive news for those that recall the shocking scenes from Marseilles during Euro 2016, with English fans in Volgograd reporting “fantastic” hospitality and a trouble-free experience.In fairness it was a deserved result for Three Lions, as Harry Kane said so himself, who have already done better than defending champions Germany, and favourites Brazil, Spain and Argentina in navigating their opening Group G encounter.But to today’s three games! On day six we’ll see the conclusion of the first round of group stage clashes, and as always we’ll have live blogs, match reports and special features in abundance to keep you across all the action.He was the subject of will-he, won’t-he speculation following his champions league final injury that saw him fail to appear in their opening match, but Mohammed Salah has confirmed he’s ready for Egypt’s crunch game against the host nation.Before then though we’ll get our first look at Group H. How will Colombia’s forgotten man, Radamel Falcao, fare after the agony of missing Brazil 2014, against Japan’s Samurai Blue? Another man seeking redemption is Poland’s goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, after harrowing showings at Euro 2012 and 2016 he takes on a Senegalese side whose coach Aliou Cissé hopes can recreate the memorable team of 2002, of which he was a integral part.Three terrific features there from Stuart James, David Hytner and Ed Aarons to sink your teeth into to start the day. Meanwhile, here’s the match schedule:I’m here for the next few hours alongside the early birds of UK and Western Europe and the night owls of North \u0026amp South America to help you get up to speed.

Most show a variety of meals prepared for the week ahead – quinoa salads, chicken rice bowls, carrot sticks, broccoli florets, hulled strawberries – all displayed in a selection of artfully photographed Tupperware-style containers.Behind the glamour of such posts, meal prep is a simple concept: set aside a day of the week to prepare the bare bones of your meals for the following week, then store it in containers in your freezer or refrigerator until its allotted day. The theory is that it saves time in the busy midweek when the idea of cooking from scratch feels draining. It also saves money by encouraging home cooking and reduces food and packaging waste. It is favoured by those who wish to control portion size and calorie consumption and those following, say, a high-protein diet. In short, it is beloved by fitness fanatics, the financially thrifty, the environmentally minded, the nutritionally conscious and, of course, wellness bloggers.King came across meal prep six years ago, before he worked in fitness, while taking part in a shoot for Men’s Health magazine. “I was working with a trainer and meal prep has been a long-running thing with people who train,” he says. “He told me about prepping chicken, protein shakes, boiled eggs. It was so boring and bland, but it was the first time I did it and it was like: ‘Wow, it really is important to know these things if you want to be goal-specific.’ Diet is absolutely key when it comes to the whole shebang of keeping fit and meal prep makes it one more thing not to worry about.”These days, King goes “in and out” of meal prep. He has a base level of fitness and a breadth of nutritional knowledge that allows him to be a little more relaxed. But when he has a particular need to be at his physical peak he returns to a meal-prepping regime. “I’ve got a photoshoot in about three weeks’ time for my online coaching service, so in about a week, when I get back from Ibiza, I’ll be getting my containers out,” he says. “I’ll have two weeks of being very disciplined. I hate the word diet, but I batten down the hatches and focus on fueling my body the best way I can.”For King, and most meal preppers, work begins at the weekend. “I always recommend to clients that Sunday is a great day to get organised for the week ahead,” he says. “It stimulates the brain. You can spend an afternoon on the sofa refreshing your phone or going down the pub, but what about going to the market, the fishmonger, the butcher, planning your week, working within a budget, thinking about packaging?”He has a few tricks: “How you can make 30 mini omelettes in a mini-muffin tray, how you can cook eggs in bulk in an oven, how roughly two skewers would be enough protein for a meal, how blanching broccoli means it won’t go soggy after a couple of days,” he says. “You can be efficient and productive about it, but you can also make an afternoon out of it – work with your partner, put some music on.” The containers are essential. “There are many different sizes, with different compartments, which helps portion control,” King explains. “So you can weigh out X grams of meat or veg or salad.”Showing off our food is nothing new – think of the Victoria sponges, raspberry jams and prize onions of a village fete, of buffet spreads and the relentless peacocking of dinner parties. “We always have a Martha Stewart impulse in a society – we want to make something and we want to show everyone we made it and it looks great,” Elias says. “People will do that for ever and always have. But Instagram adds another level.”This is the strange puzzle of meal prep. On the one hand, it appears another symptom of an ostentatious, aesthetically preoccupied age, in which one cannot simply eat healthily, but must do so in a way that is meticulously curated and visually pleasing and then posted about on the internet. On the other, there is something so curiously old-fashioned here – a return to the culture of the weekly shop, the rhythm of meal planning and home cooking – that it is hard not to view it as a reaction to the age of instant gratification, a rejection of the world in which every kind of cuisine is available to us at any hour of the day.It is striking how many men have embraced the trend. “It’s part of a larger shift in masculinity and part of the de-industrialisation of society,” says Elias. “Manliness is uncoupled from manual labour. And, since the 80s, cooking has been a thing that both men and women can be impressed by. So, men are now cooking. But, of course, they take it over and it becomes competitive.” For those who can find neither time nor inclination to spend their Sundays slaving over a hot mini-muffin tray, there is the promise of a meal-prep delivery service, where all the chopping, dicing, measuring and boxing has been done for you.The biggest of these is HelloFresh, which launched in the UK six and a half years ago and now has 1.9 million customers worldwide. Co-founder Patrick Drake says the company ascertained that it was “all the stuff before cooking” that put off people who felt they could not cook or did not like cooking. “It was the meal planning, the trudging to the supermarket, the buying ingredients in bulk that never get used up,” says Drake. What meal-prep delivery gave them, he argues, “was a feeling of achievement” untouched by ready meals or takeaway. “The slightly intangible thing is that little moment of victory when they stand back and say: ‘I made that!’ It’s a satisfying thing to take raw ingredients and turn them into a beautiful meal.”For all its peculiarities and showiness, #mealprep might serve as “a bridge for people who didn’t grow up cooking”, says Elias. King agrees: “If you’ve fallen out of touch with how food is made, meal prep can help you find it again.”Even those who have made a career exploring the sensuous pleasures of food are not necessarily horrified by the trend. “It’s sort of Lego cooking, isn’t it?” says the food writer and Great British Menu judge Matthew Fort. “But anything that encourages people to cook meals from scratch must be a good thing. It’s also a useful way, if that’s your bent of mind, to control how much you eat and your calorie intake – though I personally find that rather depressing.”King encourages prospective meal preppers to ignore the pressures of social media hashtags. “Don’t be one of these Instagram-happy people with their overnight oats,” he laughs. “Not everyone has the time, money and energy to do it like that. I think food is something that should be enjoyed it’s important not to get bogged down by it.”Some degree of meal prep can, however, play a role in regaining a heathy relationship with eating. “It’s common for those with eating disorders as part of their recovery to have input from a dietician or a trained professional and to have meal plans as part of quite a structured approach,” Quinn says. “For people with eating disorders, there can be some anxiety around spontaneous approaches to eating – for example, going to a restaurant where you don’t know the menu. So, some structured plan over a week, where you know this is what you are going to be eating and these are the ingredients, can be helpful. But this is only done with support and guidance with a trained professional. We would never recommend just going on to Instagram and seeing what someone else’s meal plan is.”I traipse through the internet in search of meal prep ideas: pretty mason jars filled with layers of fruit and granola, black rice sushi rolls, sweet potato chunks held in airtight plastic containers in shades of sapphire and frosted crystal. It is a world that seems potentially bright and crisp and exciting.At some point, I follow a link to a story about a woman in Australia who preps a month’s worth of family breakfasts and lunches in just four hours for approximately $60 (£34), but when I look at the pictures I feel crestfallen by their beigeness: puff pastry pinwheels, cheese sandwiches, containers of macaroni cheese. This, I suspect, is the more prosaic reality of meal prep.I think of something Fort said when we discussed the trend’s potential drawbacks. “The only major criticism is that it removes the instinctive and creative part of cooking,” he says. “What seems a brilliant idea when you plan on a Sunday night might seem rather less desirable when you get to a damp, cold, wet Thursday. For me, part of the pleasure of cooking is the instinctive response to ingredients, of looking at something and thinking: ‘Ah! What shall I do with that?’ And so, for me, it might be a little sterile. Because the idea of eating for pleasure, for joy, for happiness, a sense of community, seems a pity to lose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c7d9cf42ea9d687bf9037355f0250612dbd661e/46_0_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d830a98e953292b8d58efb7bbd9cc778","title":"multiple orgasm clitoris science research","story":"On-screen depictions of sex show women coming again and again, yet in reality many women never climax during sex. Here’s what we know so far about the clitoris and G-spotI’ll set the scene. There will be a man and a woman and they are having sex. Up against a wall, in a bed, in a car, anywhere. Vertically, horizontally. Clothed or unclothed. None of that matters, because the outcome will be the same. Within a minute, usually, the man and woman will have an orgasm at the same time. It will be visible, spectacular, satisfying. Then perhaps, she will have another and another and another.This scene will be familiar because it has been enacted ever since sex was allowed onscreen. But it is fiction. Not because women can’t have multiple orgasms. But if they do, it is unlikely to be because of thrusting. That’s if they get an orgasm in the first place.The orgasm. “A feeling of intense sexual pleasure that happens during sexual activity,” according to the NHS. That much is known. But e any deeper into the science of women’s genitalia, and how they work, and there will be surprises. We’re still in a black hole of not knowing very much about the sexual health and mechanisms of half the population. A few things that scientists and academics are still fiercely debating: how a female orgasm is triggered, what it does and what it’s for. Things are better than they were in the 19th century, when male gynaecologists examined women while standing behind a cloak. But in the late 1970s, medical men were still having earnest discussions in the pages of medical journals about whether menstruating women emitted a poisonous substance called menotoxin, that made flowers wilt. The US National Institutes of Health only set up a programme to research vaginal health in 1992 – the male orgasm was first researched a century earlier.After climax, or resolution, the man enters a “refractory period,” where he has to recover. This varies from a few minutes in young men to 20 hours in older ones, but however long it is, there will be no response to sexual stimulation. A\u0026nbspwoman has no such barrier. If she has had an orgasm, and not faked it, she may “plateau”, but within seconds or minutes, or when she feels like it, given the right stimulation – probably (but not only) clitoral – she can feasibly orgasm again. The\u0026nbspcircumstances required include her environment, her partner (if she needs one), and her knowledge of her own body. It’s surprising, says Professor Linda Cardozo, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, “how many women don’t even know what their genitalia are called”. We say vagina (the internal passage leading to the cervix) when it’s the vulva (external genitalia). We see images of women with improbably shaven genitalia, and supposedly female dolls with no external labia. The authors of one study that attempted to understand how women’s genitalia varied in appearance marvelled that “even some recent textbooks of anatomy do not include the clitoris on diagrams of the female pelvis”. When women come to her thinking they are dysfunctional in some way, says Sarah Martin, executive director of the World Association of Sex Coaches, one of the most powerful things she can do is send them away to look at their vulva in a mirror. Using the right words is important too. Vulva, not vagina. Otherwise, says Vincenzo Puppo, a sexologist at the University of Florence, women think of their vagina as “just a hole”.Martin also tries to get women to relax. Before orgasm, alpha waves in our brains slow down. A\u0026nbsprecent documentary on the “super-orgasm” – actually multiple orgasms – found\u0026nbspthat women who had multiple\u0026nbsporgasms had slower alpha waves than the average woman. Their brains were quieter, making more room for pleasure. “The thing about sex of all sorts,” says Martin, “is that sex takes place in the body. It’s very hard to think about pleasure if you are worrying instead of focusing on your body.”You may think differently about the vagina if you believe in the G-spot. Puppo has little patience with it, and labels anatomical illustrations with: “the invented zone for the G-spot”. It is named after Ernest Gräfenberg, who wrote a paper in 1950 about an erogenous zone on the vaginal anterior wall. This was launched into popular perception by an eponymous 1981 book written by two psychologists and a nurse, and by countless articles since. The nurse was Beverley Whipple, who told the Science Vs podcast that her team had investigated by inserting fingers into women’s vaginas and feeling around the clock. “Between 11o’clock and 1 o’clock,” Whipple says, “we got a lot of smiles.”What a great thought. Except Gräfenberg never wrote about a G-spot. He did write about women he called “frigid,” and reported that some women were stimulated by inserting hat pins. There is still no good scientific data to prove its existence, although plenty of women believe they have one. “The G-spot,” wrote the neuroscientist Terence Hines in 2001, “will remain a sort of gynaecologic UFO, much searched for and discussed, but unverified by objective means.” The debate matters, says Puppo, because “women who fail to ‘find’ their G-spot, because they fail to respond to stimulation as the G-spot myth suggests that they should, may end up feeling inadequate or abnormal”.Cardozo, is circumspect. “There is some doubt as to whether a particular spot in the anterior vaginal wall is relevant in terms of orgasm. When women have had that part of the anterior wall excised, they have still been able to orgasm.”The G-spot debate hasn’t prevented cosmeto-gynaecologists from offering procedures such a G-spot amplification, a concept first offered by the Californian gynaecologist David Matlock, who decided injecting collagen into the vaginal wall would enhance sensation for four months and the chance of single or multiple vaginal orgasms. The American College of Obstetricians disagreed,\u0026nbspdeciding that the procedure had no scientific\u0026nbspbasis, and anyway, Cardozo says, “the herd of cows that provided the collagen died out”. Now the money-maker is the O-shot (O for orgasm), an injection into the vaginal wall\u0026nbspof platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derived from the woman’s blood.“There is no scientific data on this,” says Cardozo, with some finality, although PRP\u0026nbsphas worked in dental patients,\u0026nbspallegedly enhancing the\u0026nbsphealing process. You probably want tips for how to get a multiple orgasm here. Or\u0026nbspeven a single one. I prescribe better research, of course. But also, better talking. Communication is as powerful as lube, whether it’s with a partner or a doctor. For women who think they need to surgically alter their vulva because they are abnormal, the American College of\u0026nbspObstetricians prescribes “a frank discussion” about the wide range of\u0026nbspnormal genitalia.The clitoris should be placed on\u0026nbspequal standing with the penis. All these prescriptions can combine for as pleasing an outcome as an orgasm, single or multiple. Because\u0026nbspit matters. The female orgasm may have a reproductive role or not: I’ll leave that up to scientists to debate, and celebrate the fact that they are debating it. Perhaps it’s enough to know that an orgasm feels good, and in these dark times you deserve it, or many."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8710f812317610298b704e58da8ca80f4b32c396/0_0_3000_1995/master/3000.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afa2f56fb488146f432760ee9ff7b0f3 720w","title":"new lords defeat for government on brexit meaningful vote amendment","story":"Landslide vote by peers, including 22 Tory rebels, sets up another Commons showdownThe government has been defeated in a landslide Lords vote which will set up another Commons showdown over an amendment to give MPs a “meaningful vote” even if the government fails to reach a Brexit deal.The House of Lords voted in favour of a new amendment, devised by Tory MP and pro-EU rebel Dominic Grieve and tabled by Viscount Hailsham, by a significantly bigger margin than the last time the issue was debated. The amendment was passed by 354 votes to 235 – a majority of 119.Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten and Sayeeda Warsi were among the 22 Tory peers who rebelled and backed the amendment.Hailsham, the former Conservative cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, tabled the last-minute amendment on Monday morning, based on the deal Grieve believed he had struck with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, in order to avert a government defeat in the Commons by pro-EU Tories.Grieve said later he was double-crossed and the government went back on the agreement they had reached. Ministers tabled an amendment that would mean a vote only on a neutral motion, which would give MPs no power to halt a cliff-edge Brexit – a change that Grieve said meant the compromise was unacceptable.Hailsham tabled an amendment which he said was based on the original deal, dubbed “Grieve 2”, which he said would give MPs the chance to vote in parliament, even in the event of “no deal”. Speaking in the House of Lords, Hailsham said: “I am asking your lordships to make a decision to enable a House of Commons to vote on what Mr Grieve believes was agreed with the government.”Hailsham said Grieve was a man “of the utmost personal and professional integrity” and said he accepted his version of events “without reservation”. He said the government’s offer “not only fails to deliver a promised ‘meaningful vote’... but is far worse. It is seeking to make it impossible. It deliberately removes the possibility.”Under the new amendment, ministers must update parliament by 21 January 2019 if there is no prospect of a deal with the EU and then have two weeks to return to the House of Commons with a statement on how the government plans to proceed. MPs would then be given a vote on whether to approve the action in statement.The Commons will vote on the revised amendment on Wednesday, though government sources have said they are confident Tory rebels do not have the numbers for it to pass.The House of Lords leader, Natalie Evans, had urged peers to reject the amendment. “It is not right that your lordships’ house could have a veto on the deal simply by refusing to consider a motion,” she said, saying the alternative amendment by Hailsham contained “major flaws”.Several former Tory cabinet ministers also spoke out against the amendment. Former party leader Michael Howard said the amendment “would be to confer upon parliament a negotiation power which has always resided in the hands of the executive in our country”. Former chancellor Norman Lamont said the amendment was unnecessary because parliament would always have the power to act in the event of no deal. “Obviously it would come to parliament, obviously it would be a major event,” he said. “Do we really have to write it down with all these complicated provisions?”The meaningful vote is now the only unresolved issue after peers agreed not to pursue further challenges on other key issues such as membership of a customs union. At the report stage of the bill, peers inflicted 15 defeats on the government.Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, defended the scrutiny that the EU withdrawal bill had come under, calling the original legislation “deeply flawed and isive”.“We’ve seen a fair bit of sabre rattling from some of the most enthusiastic of Brexiteers and supporters,” she said, saying the drama did “nothing to improve the quality of debate or journalistic integrity”.Smith said she did not believe the Lords should engage in extensive “ping pong” between the Lords and the Commons lightly, but said matters are “clearly and obviously unresolved in the House of Commons”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cab9cff4ee7b7b4400779a5d44c24142bc1b23e/0_0_1931_1159/master/1931.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=313d25f778279a4f8952b7ad6c124faa","title":"primary school children affected by hygiene poverty charity finds","story":"One in four families surveyed have gone without toiletries because of financial difficultiesPrimary school children are arriving for their lessons unwashed and in dirty clothes because their parents cannot afford to buy washing powder, soap or shampoo, according to a survey by a UK charity.Schools are intervening to support struggling families who are having to choose between food or personal hygiene. More than half of primary teachers who took part in a parallel survey said they provide pupils with washing powder, soap and shampoo on a weekly basis because of family hygiene poverty issues.Child psychologist Dr Richard Woolfson said: “Children’s self-esteem is greatly affected by the reaction of those around them – and if they are stigmatised, ridiculed or rejected by their peers because of poor basic hygiene, their sense of self-worth will quickly nose-e. “No child wants to be taunted because they are dirty, or because their clothes are filthy. They’ll start to lose interest in their education, their friendships will suffer, and they’ll be reluctant to attend school.”Nicola Finney, the head teacher at St Paul’s Church of England primary school in Stoke-on-Trent, said she was having to dip into the school budget to supply toiletries, washing powder, toothpaste and deodorant as an increasing number of families could not afford to buy their own.“We have seen significantly more children coming into school with washing and hygiene issues over the last few years,” she said. “It used to be just a couple of children across the school, but now there are two or three in every classroom dealing with these issues.”Finney said she had spent hundreds of pounds of her own money helping pupils to buy these items because she couldn’t bear to see them go without. “On one occasion I bought a washing machine for a family who had just had a newborn baby and had nowhere to wash their clothes.“We have been considering installing a washing machine in school and we stockpile spare, washed uniforms so pupils can get changed and sent home clean – and nobody is any the wiser that we have stepped in to help.”The survey which involved 2,000 parents of primary school children and 100 teachers across the UK was commissioned by the charity In Kind Direct, which receives donated goods from companies and distributes them to UK charities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb9d182afa9a861fb49a335ca23d27f87baa97fb/0_184_596_358/master/596.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b54ef285e9063d5277c9a8171e5b82d","title":"thousands of public buildings and spaces england sold off councils private developers","story":"Councils selling majority to private developers not community groups, says reportMore than 4,000 public buildings and spaces in England are being sold off every year, with more than 7,000 others at risk over the next five years, a charity has said.Locality says the majority of the sites being offloaded by local authorities are sold to private developers for the highest price, forever lost to communities around them. The charity wants the government to create a £200m-a-year community ownership fund for the next five years to help preserve the buildings and spaces for the use of local people. Tony Armstrong, its chief executive, said: “This is a sell-off on a massive scale. We know that many of the buildings being lost have valuable community uses. “Everyone of us can think of a local public building or outside space we love and use, from libraries to lidos and town halls to youth centres. They are owned by the public and they’re being sold off for short-term gain to fill holes in council budgets. “Many hundreds of local community groups are stepping up and fighting for community ownership. But they urgently need support and help with startup costs if they are to compete with the commercial developers.” Faced with the need to make savings of £90m over the next three years, Liverpool city council has decided to sell the Grade II*-listed Municipal Buildings, having deemed the 150-year-old structure “surplus to requirements”. One bidder wants to turn it into a five-star hotel.The council has approved a deal with developer Mastcraft to turn the Grade II-listed building into a 140-bed boutique hotel. The deal is for a 245-year lease but the council will retain the east wing for civic use.A plan for the Far East Consortium to redevelop the 1935 Grade II*-listed building, reputed to be the venue where in 1971 Queen played their first\u0026nbsp​concert, was approved in October. Despite a petition signed by nearly 7,000 people, the £27m sale is due to be confirmed next month.The Victorian baths, dating from 1904, have been sold to private-equity firm Castleforge Partners, which says the building will house an art gallery, offices, affordable workspaces, pop-ups, shops, cafés, a health centre and food stalls.The historic Grade II-listed former theatre, where Laurel\u0026nbsp​and Hardy, Nina Simone and George Formby performed, was sold at auction for £325,000 last year after an attempt by the Friends of Hulme Hippodrome to get it listed as an asset of community value was rejected by the council.Built in 1891, the Victorian building fell into disrepair and was empty. A group of residents came together to save the institute in 2014 when Kirklees council was selling off publicly owned buildings. It now includes a library, a fully accessible post office, an office for Meltham town council, offices for local firms and start-ups and a school of dance, as well as three large spaces used by community groups.The oldest Grade II-listed baths still open for public swimming in the UK were set to close in July 2017 but the Edwardian building has remained open as a communit-run venue.The 650-foot Victorian pier used to ferry passengers to the opposite bay was left unused and in disrepair for many years. Thanks to local people buying shares for £25 each, £62,000 was raised and the pier was saved in February this year.Horton Chapel, a Grade II-listed Edwardian chapel built as part of the then new Horton Asylum and designed to accommodate hundreds of patients and staff, stood vacant for many years. In 2016, the Horton Chapel Arts and Heritage Society came together to save it as a not-for-profit art centre.The 1930s Grade II-listed swimming pool complex was closed by the council in 2009 but it has since agreed to give community ownership to a group of local residents, the Byrne Avenue Trust.The Great British Sell Off report is published on Tuesday and is based on freedom of information requests sent to all 353 local authorities in England. Locality received 55 responses on the number of buildings and spaces sold between the financial years 2012-13 and 2016-17, as well as 127 replies about sites identified as surplus over the next five years, extrapolating the results to obtain national totals. Only two fifths of councils (based on 233 responses) said they had a strategy to support community ownership, known as a community asset transfer policy. Locality wants all councils to have one of these policies, giving community groups first right of refusal to buy public buildings and for them to have a year, rather than six months, to draw up a proposal.In Hastings residents were left furious on Saturday after it was confirmed the town’s pier had been sold to a businessman for a fraction of what it cost to rebuild. Sheikh Abid Gulzar reportedly paid £50,000, while the Friends of Hastings Pier group had raised £477,000 of its £500,000 target to buy it.In West Yorkshire, residents are trying to save the former Dewsbury Museum, closed by the council in 2016 after 120 years owing to financial pressures. Jax Lovelock, who chairs the Dewsbury Park Mansion community hub, said the aim was for the building to be used for health and wellbeing services, as well as space for startups and community events. “Over the last 10 to 15 years, our town as well as towns all over the country have had their civic hearts stripped out of them,” she said. “Communities will get off their backsides and do things for themselves but they need that guidance and support to be able to do that.”Locality said austerity was to blame for the sell-off, a view shared by the Local Government Association. Richard Watts, who chairs the LGA’s resources board, said: “Local councillors, elected by local people, understand the deep connection communities have with their public spaces and buildings. If we are to be able to maintain them and fund frontline services, the government must address our funding shortfall of over £5bn a year by 2020 as soon as possible.”A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said councils had £90.7bn to spend on local services over the next two years, which they were responsible for spending wisely. He added: “All local authorities must properly consider the risks and opportunities before making commercial decisions.“We are working with local government to develop a funding system for the future based on the needs of different areas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c2def368deb53ba1d41e967f0c8b1888face3a/0_109_3314_1988/master/3314.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77a5d9386ed8774a25c08e7fc3b1614c","title":"andy murray comeback nick kyrgios queens","story":"• Former World No 1 confident he will not re-injure hip• ‘I didn’t want to get back on court until I could compete’Nick Kyrgios says he regards Andy Murray as “one of my better mates on tour” and the feeling is undoubtedly mutual but the Australian arrives here in the sort of form that could destroy the former world No 1 when he makes his comeback on Tuesday.Kyrgios, who frightened the life out of Roger Federer in a thrilling three-set semi-final in Stuttgart on Saturday, said of Murray’s absence since Wimbledon last year: “It’s been pretty shitty without him. I’m looking forward to going out there and playing. But to see him healthy is obviously the main thing. He’s awesome for the sport.”They have both struggled with injuries over the past year, Murray risking surgery on his hip in January to save his career, Kyrgios dealing with a recurring elbow problem that seems to have finally left him in peace – as he has done with Murray.“We kept in touch a little bit but he’s a busy man,” Kyrgios said. “The last thing he wants is to see me blowing up his phone. Probably can’t take me seriously. My elbow is fine. I have zero pain now and I played three quality matches in Stuttgart. Obviously I was pretty disappointed I didn’t win against Roger but it was a good match. I was in complete control in the third-set tie-break at one stage. I’m feeling good. My level is still there.“I know he’s going to make a lot of balls. He loves playing on grass. I know how he plays. I watched a little of him today in practice. He looked fine.”Murray, who has won this title five times, returns after 11 months away hoping just to be competitive. “There’s never a time when you feel perfect,” he told the BBC. “It’s not a gamble in terms that I’m going to re-injure my hip. But if I missed the grasscourt season and tried to play in five weeks’ time the same doubts would be there.“You re-evaluate. You find that out by being out there. It’s very different from the controlled environment of the practice court. I didn’t want to get back on the match court until I felt I could compete. Hopefully the body responds well. I expect to be a bit stiff and sore after it.He said the medical feedback after his operation in January has been, “really positive” but no surgeon could assess his match fitness.Earlier Stan Wawrinka, one of a slew of leading players trying to keep their bodies in one piece for Wimbledon in a fortnight, looked as strong as ever when he thrashed Britain’s Cameron Norrie on the Queen’s grass in less than an hour, 6-2, 6-3.Norrie, who has risen to 80 in the world in his first full season on Tour, struggled to cope with Wawrinka’s power from hand and off the ground in the first set, and never properly got into the contest in the first round of the Fever-Tree Championships.Wawrinka, a three-times grand slam winner, quickly reminded Norrie of his pedigree when he broke for 3-1 and held as the second set slipped quickly from the Briton’s grasp.Norrie served through deuce in the seventh game to stay alive, calmly putting away a forehand volley, but there was not a lot he could do about the Swiss’s serve, as Wawrinka held to love with his 13th ace of the match. It was a chastening experience for the British No 2.“He managed his serve very well,” Norrie said. “It was tough for me to get into the rallies. I didn’t serve that great. I didn’t really feel comfortable on my feet. I felt like out on the corners I was going to slip and I didn’t really want to tear up my hip or anything.”That could be a warning for Murray on the lush grass that has often upended players early in the tournament. Wawrinka, who had two knee operations last year, said courtside: “In general it has been improving week after week. I feel strong physically but you need to be patient, ready to accept the frustration of not playing your best tennis. It’s never easy on the grass. But today was great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c850075176ac2baaec1ec9359b56ff6f0a44652f/0_112_3345_2007/master/3345.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47e7e435d56be3c347ae0215df59bd97","title":"lady aurelia fancied battaash kings stand stakes royal ascot","story":"• Quick, dry ground expected to favour Wesley Ward’s US raider• Lady Aurelia backed down to below 2-1 Battaash out to 11-4Lady Aurelia, twice a winner at Royal Ascot, edged in front of Battaash in the betting on Monday for a 60-second duel between two of the fastest horses in the world, in the King’s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot on Tuesday.Even the English weather is expected to behave itself as the Royal meeting begins with a dry forecast and quick summer ground for a major Flat meeting for what feels like the first time in years. That may have played a part in punters’ calculations on Monday, as Lady Aurelia’s odds dipped below 2-1 with most bookmakers while Battaash, the easy winner of the Prix de l’Abbaye last season, can be backed at 11-4. The two market leaders were locked together at 9-4 on Monday morning.There is no mystery about the plan of attack when it comes to Lady Aurelia. This is her third consecutive trip to Royal Ascot from Wesley Ward’s stable in the US and she has won the Queen Mary Stakes and then the King’s Stand last year in identical style, bursting from the stalls and daring a rival to attempt to match strides with her. As yet no rival has and Lady Aurelia has recorded victories by seven lengths and then three, which are remarkable margins for top-class sprint events.John Velazquez, who has flown in from the US to take the ride on the filly, will take the same approach on Tuesday and quick ground will help to ensure that her blinding speed lasts all the way to the line.The case against her, meanwhile, revolves around Battaash. Is he a better rival than she has faced at Ascot to date? And is there a chance that the big two will battle each other to a standstill by the final furlong and allow an unexpected winner to chase them down at the post?“She’s bucking and kicking, which is just what you want to see, as she’ll need to be every bit as good as she ever was to get the job done again,” Ward said on Monday. “She loves it here and she thrives here. She’s doing great. It should be a great race and that’s what racing is all about.”Battaash raced against Lady Aurelia in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York last August, when he boiled over in the preliminaries and failed to run up to form. He seemed more relaxed before his first race of the season at Haydock last month but horses can be highly sensitive to a big‑race atmosphere and cautious punters may wait until he is safely at the start before stepping in to back him.Somewhat unusually the head-to-head in the King’s Stand Stakes does not involve runners for either Aidan O’Brien or the Godolphin operation but the fiercest rivals in Flat racing are well represented both on the opening day and throughout the week ahead.Tips by Chris Cook.A much-needed first success in the Derby for the royal blue Godolphin colours will mean that Sheikh Mohammed’s operation, the biggest in the global Flat racing business, will arrive in Berkshire in confident mood. John Gosden, meanwhile, who has become something of a third force in the battle for major honours on the Flat, is also in the running to finish the week as the leading trainer.All three of the big players have a runner with a chance in the St\u0026nbspJames’s Palace Stakes, which is, in theory at least, the feature race of the day. But romantics will undoubtedly side with Tip Two Win, the runner-up in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, who arrives from the much smaller stable run by Roger Teal, just down the road from Ascot at Great Shefford.That form would probably see Tip Two Win heading the market – were he trained by Gosden or O’Brien. “I suppose it’s down to fashion,” Teal said. “The big stables are more fashionable than small yards like ours, who don’t often win Group Ones.”Victory for Tip Two Win on Tuesday would be one fashion faux pas of which most of those at Ascot would thoroughly approve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/654eb4dea358ac14222c0ee9d391ed8c226f3130/0_206_5606_3364/master/5606.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf4ff6cc3f70a7dc8b62d28ea8f3d451","title":"i was 25 years soon you get opportunities now","story":"It is 31 years since Gay Kelleway won at Royal Ascot, the first and only woman jockey to do so. The name of the race, the Queen Alexandra Stakes, hangs proudly above her stables in Exning, the original plaque from the days before electronic scoreboards. Now a trainer, she is keen to see another woman triumph.“No pressure Josephine, get your arse in gear,” laughs Kelleway over a cup of tea at home with one of Britain’s finest young jockeys, Josephine Gordon. “I do not want to be dead or wheeled in when it happens. When they take pictures of me to say, ‘Oh she was the first,’ I\u0026nbspdon’t want to be shrivelled up.”Gordon makes her second ever appearance at Royal Ascot this week – the 25-year-old rides regularly for Sir Michael Stoute and Hugo Palmer, for whom she won on Encrypted at York on Saturday. Overcoming cultural barriers, she was the first woman to ride and win for Godolphin and matched Hayley Turner’s milestone of riding 100 winners in a year (and she did it in fewer days).Kelleway appreciates the kudos but sets the record straight. “Jo’s looked at as a jockey not a girl. I’ve spoken to all the trainers and really and truly that’s how they see her. Josephine’s better than the lads. In my opinion she’s one of the best riders, nothing about being a woman. It’s Josephine the jockey not Josephine the girl.”Dotted around the house are photographs of celebrities Kelleway has met – Frank Lampard (“I’m a huge Chelsea fan”), Dame Judi Dench (“she loves racing”) and a handwritten letter from Fred Astaire to her father, the trainer Paul Kelleway. As they chat, Kelleway’s Yorkshire terrier hops on Gordon’s lap and licks her face. The two women are comfortable in each others’ company. But their relationship did not get off to the best\u0026nbspof starts.“She probably thought: ‘God, what a bitch,’” says Kelleway, remembering back to her treatment of Stan Moore’s young apprentice three years ago. “Stan rang me and said: ‘Gay, I’ve got a real good rider.’ I said: ‘Here we go again, Stan, another one of your riders, blah blah blah.’” Kelleway rolls her eyes.Gordon smiles. “Yeah, I picked up a spare ride, What A Party at Chelmsford, it was a three-runner race – and it finished third. I’d never\u0026nbspeven spoken to Gay before but after the race I got an earful. I\u0026nbspthought: ‘Well, I’m never riding for\u0026nbspher again.’”“I thought, ‘Well, she ain’t used her\u0026nbspbrains well there,’” says Kelleway,\u0026nbspcontinuing the story. “I\u0026nbspwas a bit grumpy towards her. The\u0026nbspowner gives me so much shit, so I\u0026nbspgive her a bit of a hard time. But after that I\u0026nbspwatched her and I thought, ‘You know, this girl does ride really well. I’ve got it a bit wrong.’ And you’ve improved so much since then, haven’t you?”“Well,” says Gordon, quietly folding her hands in her lap, “I still feel like I gave the horse a good ride!” The two of them laugh.“To be fair, she did,” Kelleway concedes, “because that’s as good as the horse was.” It is interesting hearing the two compare life as a jockey, now and then. “I’d give anything to be a jockey now,” Kelleway says. “My dad used to say to me, ‘You were 10 years too soon.’ More like 25. You get the opportunities now. You’re accepted.”You also get to ride at a heavier weight. Kelleway’s memories are dark wasting to a point of despair. She used to take a diet pill with black\u0026nbspcoffee in the morning, a piece of cheese the size of her thumbnail for lunch and a little fish and vegetables for dinner. She took water retention tablets and destroyed her kidneys.“If I was tested now, I wouldn’t pass. I was taking tenuate do. I wasted so hard I was a miserable sod. I never flipped because I can’t bear being sick, but I was obsessed with weight. I thought, ‘I can’t keep doing this. It’s going to kill me.’ I’ve got pictures where my face is sunken in, I’ve got black under my eyes. It was awful in my day. It was\u0026nbspprehistoric.”Last year Kelleway gave an interview claiming she had experienced sexual harassment and abuse throughout her career, including from high-profile jockeys and trainers. What made her speak out? “A girl went to the press but she wouldn’t give her name. So they\u0026nbsprang me and asked me. I said I\u0026nbspdon’t know what goes on now but I\u0026nbspgot harassed.”How did racing respond to Kelleway breaking her silence? “Some of the trainers, they said you didn’t have to put that in there. I said you want to shut up, the way you used to knock on my door in hotels. They’re a bit wary of me. I don’t hold back my words. Well, I’ve got this far, haven’t I? I don’t need anything. Don’t need anybody.”A quiet settles over the table, Gordon listening carefully to her predecessor. What did she make of the revelations? “Gay messaged me the night before it came out. I thought it was a joke at first … I can see how it’s happened. It probably wouldn’t go on as much now.”Kelleway talks of routine bullying and intimidation that went with it. “They do do that,” says Gordon, nodding to the stories of mind games in a race. “They wouldn’t do it to me now but when you first start riding, if you’ve got a good position in a race, they’ll say, ‘Just give me an inch’ or ‘Stay in there’ and try take your position. You have to learn to stand your ground.”She sympathises, too, for the life of a jockey. “I used to think that jockeys were really grumpy and rude and stuck up. But now I realise you’re literally just tired.” Gordon yawns. It is her one day off and she’s given up her lie-in for this interview.Back in 1987, on Sprowston Boy, Kelleway beat an all-star field in Lester Piggott, Willie Carson and Pat\u0026nbspEddery. “I kicked at Swinley Bottom and I heard Willie Carson saying, ‘Don’t go yet!’ I said ‘Piss off!’” she giggles, “It was heavy ground and there was only one way to ride that horse – kick early.” Nowadays, she muses, winning such a big race would change one’s life – like Michelle Payne’s historic win in\u0026nbspthe Melbourne Cup, currently being turned into a movie. Back then it did not.Gordon makes no secret of her aim to become champion jockey one day – she was only the third female jockey to win champion apprentice – and her dream is to win the Derby. What makes her so talented? “No disrespect but she looks like a fella riding,” deadpans Kelleway. The pair laugh.“I mean, you wouldn’t pick her out in a race. Her physique, the way she rides, she positions horses well. We can all steer a horse. But using your brain to get an extra gear out of them, it’s all about tactical riding, knowing the racetracks. And she’s as brave as a lion. Aren’t you? Some of those apprentice boys they look like Josephine and they ride weak. There’s a well‑known lightweight jockey, she’d outride him anyday. Same horses. She’s stronger in a finish.”She is also blessed with a body that doesn’t need to waste. “If I did I\u0026nbspwouldn’t be a jockey,” says Gordon. “I’m lucky that I can eat anything I want – McDonald’s.”Does she feel that British racing should adopt the new French system, which last year introduced a weight allowance of 2kg (4.5lb) for women jockeys? “I was there last weekend,” says Gordon. “I’d never really seen a girl ride there much. But there were 11 of us that day. So\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspmade a difference. If they brought something like that out here, it is sexist but it’s only going to\u0026nbsphelp me.”Do women jockeys need help? Gordon shakes her head. “It’s all about technique. I actually think some horses prefer having a girl on. If you’ve got a horse that needs to be\u0026nbspasked nicely rather than forced, then it’s beneficial. Horses like to think they’re just tanking with you. If you tell a lad, ‘Don’t beat it up,’ he’ll do just that.”If Gordon triumphs this week there will be a stables in Exning that joins in the celebration – marking the\u0026nbspend of one era and the beginning of the next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f392dcd1d56a1680281daae2d0617ddc44c0ae76/0_66_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a685ec4500f96d30d6e98e5bc1f17fab","title":"quality street review jm barrie romcom chocolates pitlochry festival theatre","story":"Pitlochry Festival theatreLiz Carruthers directs a sprightly, good-looking revival of Barrie’s romantic 1902 hitValentine Brown is trying to persuade Phoebe Throssel that age is no barrier to their romance. She might regret the decade that has passed since he abruptly left to fight in the Napoleonic wars, leaving their love unrequited, but he’s having none of it. “Instead of growing older you shall grow younger,” he says, promising to heal the wounds of time.No prizes for guessing the playwright is JM Barrie. Two years after the 1902 premiere of Quality Street (a big enough hit to inspire a line of chocolates which were advertised using its characters), he wrote Peter Pan, the heartbreaking tale of a boy who wouldn’t grow old while his poor playmate aged. The loss of youth remained a preoccupation as late as 1920 when, in Mary Rose, he conjured up a woman who has vanished for 21 years without ageing a day.In the case of Quality Street, given a sprightly, good-looking production by Liz Carruthers, the missing years have turned Fiona Wood’s Phoebe from a carefree debutante, all ringlets and good humour, to a serious-minded teacher, hair pinned back, ambitions curtailed. One minute, she’s provoking jealous barbs from her companions, the next, she’s settling down for a lifetime of buttoned-up spinsterhood. Only by going in disguise as her youthful niece in a vaguely Shakespearean ballroom scene can she reclaim her lost youth.Barrie duly delivers a pleasant wish-fulfilment confection, its contours gentle and its spirit cheerful.

Meet the pigeon-fancier sending his LED-wearing birds heavenwards for a hypnotic night danceYou can see them in the sky long before you get close, circling high above, wheeling and ing between each other, their wings flashing in the sunshine and making a faintly mechanical whirr each time they pass overhead. This vast flock of pigeons, flying over a disused golf course next to a sewage works on the eastern edge of London, has been assembled by Duke Riley, an American artist who has now spent months training these birds to re-enact a show that caused a storm when it hit the night skies over Brooklyn in 2016. Though genetically similar to feral pigeons, these birds are specialist varieties that were selectively bred over thousands of years for their endurance and acrobatic abilities. “Most are tipplers and rollers,” says Riley. He’s a compact man with blue eyes, a square jaw and hands that look as though they are used to making things. “These are the birds people fly in New York, but they’re all English breeds originally.” There’s something knowingly old-fashioned about Riley. He wears overalls with the word “Duke” embroidered on the pocket and speaks in a hard Boston lilt. In Europe, most fanciers, as pigeon-keepers are called, are interested in racing: they take their birds away from their lofts and time how long it takes them to fly back. But in the rest of the world, it’s more of a spectator sport. Fanciers will breed a flock (or “kit”) of birds, then train them using flags and whistles to fly tightly together over their loft. In competition, points are awarded for style and time in the air, or for attracting your opponents’ birds into your flock. Riley grew up in Boston and now lives in Brooklyn, places that were once hotbeds of this kind of flying, which is now in decline in the west. He has been obsessed with pigeons ever since, as a boy, he found a lost homing pigeon and looked after it in his garage. “My mother told me to let it go,” he says, “so I did. But it kept coming back. I didn’t know anything about pigeons back then. I thought I was St Anthony.” Anthony is the patron saint of lost things, famous for his ability to speak to animals. While at art school in Providence, Rhode Island, Riley lived in an old pigeon coop at the top of an apartment building, sharing it with feral city birds. Then he met a fancier who showed him what a well trained kit could do, and he quickly became hooked. “I lived there for four years,” he says, “and I became obsessed.” He has kept pigeons ever since, wherever he’s lived. “Sometimes I was just flying a couple of birds out the bathroom window or the fire escape, but I always maintained that interest.” There are 1,500 pigeons in this loft at Thamesmead, and they require a lot of looking after. Riley and his team give them food and water twice a day, and clean out a wheelie bin’s worth of droppings every week. “It’s great fertiliser,” he says. Their health is carefully monitored, too. In the medical bay, eight birds are being treated for various ailments and injuries. They are cared for by the vet who looked after the owls on the set of the Harry Potter movies. Slivers of lemon are added to their drinking water. “Sometimes we give them garlic, too,” Riley says. “It’s good for their digestion.” For three nights this week, Riley will stage performances of his celebrated work Fly By Night – an interspecies collaboration between the artist and his birds. Tiny LED lights will be attached to the feet of the pigeons, and they will then fly around the loft in front of an audience as the sun sets. When the piece was first performed, at a naval yard in Brooklyn, it was greeted with wild acclaim. In video footage of the event, the pigeons become specks of moving light, scoring abstract shapes on to the dusky sky in a hypnotic, gyrating, extraordinary dance. Duke has brought the project to London as part of 14-18 NOW, an arts programme commemorating the centenary of the end of the first world war. Pigeons played an important role in the war: they were used on the front to deliver messages, many winning medals for their bravery. And the setting for the performance, in an area by the Thames once dominated by munitions factories, reflects that historic connection.Riley’s work has often tackled “the space between the land and the water”. He describes the land as “a hyper-governed space, where there’s all these different systems and laws and societal structures that can be oppressive”. The water, meanwhile, is “the most ungoverned space, a piece of wilderness that still has its own rules that you can’t really control”. His birds fly between these two worlds. Riley’s creations often invoke a playful folk aesthetic. He embroiders, makes scrimshaw (engravings on the tusks of sea mammals), and has a successful sideline as a tattoo artist. There is a heft to the things he makes, and a light-hearted subversiveness to the things he does. Once he created a popup bar on the Brooklyn waterfront using flotsam and jetsam collected from the Hudson River. A few years ago, he built a revolutionary-war replica submarine and sailed it towards the cruise ship Queen Mary II, before being arrested by river police as a potential terrorist. The adventures are as important as the pieces he makes out of them. For his first pigeon work, Trading With the Enemy, he trained homing pigeons to fly to a loft in Key West, Florida, before taking them to Cuba, attaching cigars to their backs in tiny rucksacks, and releasing them. Eleven made it back wearing their contraband.  After he’s finished with them, the birds will be rehomed with local fanciers. Fly By Night is partly a way of drawing attention to a lost or at least dying art. Pigeon-flying has a long history as a working class, counterintuitively urban pursuit, but fanciers are being driven out of cities by rising rents and increasing hostility to birds. “Gentrification is the culprit,” Riley says. “People are freaked out because they think pigeons are diseased, or because they misunderstand pigeon-flying and think it’s abusive. In my opinion, it’s the complete opposite.” Does he think of his work as nostalgic? “I wouldn’t use the word nostalgia necessarily,” he says, “because I think it’s dangerous. But a lot of my projects are about empowering marginal communities. We’re living in a time when technology and nature are at war with each other on many levels, not least for our attention. I want to get people to stop and pay attention to the environment around them.”He sees a correlation between the birds flying and a human drawing. “The movement that the bird makes, or when you have a whole kit of pigeons flying in a murmuration – no machine can replicate that.” In Syria, pigeon-flying is a popular pastime and Riley plans to next stage Fly By Night in a refugee camp there. A few weeks after we meet, I return to Thamesmead to watch an evening rehearsal. It had been raining all day, and Riley was worried about the wind, which was blowing gustily. As dusk fell, he climbed to the roof of his loft. A bell rang and the pigeons took off in a huge clattering cloud. Some flew low over my head. Others climbed higher and higher into the sky until they were almost out of sight. At the centre of it all stood Riley, waving his flag and directing his flock like a manic conductor, his pigeons flying around him in the darkening sky.• Fly By Night is at East Thamesmead, London, 21-23 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f192be5db55971d9b9bf627012f05c3cd15df7ed/0_633_11430_6858/master/11430.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43612a612907f920728d46b5c87cdfaa","title":"artificial intelligence ibm debate project debater","story":"IBM shows off Project Debater, artificial intelligence project designed to make coherent arguments as it processes vast data setsIt was man 1, machine 1 in the first live, public debate between an artificial intelligence system developed by IBM and two human debaters.The AI, called Project Debater, appeared on stage in a packed conference room at IBM’s San Francisco office embodied in a 6ft tall black panel with a blue, animated “mouth”. It was a looming presence alongside the human debaters Noa Ovadia and Dan Zafrir, who stood behind a podium nearby.Although the machine stumbled at many points, the unprecedented event offered a glimpse into how computers are learning to grapple with the messy, unstructured world of human decision-making.For each of the two short debates, participants had to prepare a four-minute opening statement, followed by a four-minute rebuttal and a two-minute summary. The opening debate topic was “we should subsidize space exploration”, followed by “we should increase the use of telemedicine”.In both debates, the audience voted Project Debater to be worse at delivery but better in terms of the amount of information it conveyed. And in spite of several robotic slip-ups, the audience voted the AI to be more persuasive (in terms of changing the audience’s position) than its human opponent, Zafrir, in the second debate.It’s worth noting, however, that there were many members of IBM staff in the room and they may have been rooting for their creation. IBM hopes the research will eventually enable a more sophisticated virtual assistant that can absorb massive and erse sets of information to help build persuasive arguments and make well-informed decisions – as opposed to merely responding to simple questions and commands. Project Debater was a showcase of IBM’s ability to process very large data sets, including millions of news articles across dozens of subjects, and then turn snippets of arguments into full flowing prose – a challenging task for a computer. The machine spoke with a confident female voice with a natural cadence, segues and organisational structure to its speech, but it lacked linguistic precision and argumentative clarity. During the space debate, for example, it repeated the point that space exploration is beneficial to the economy several times using slightly different words. There were also times when the second clause of a sentence didn’t smoothly follow the first clause. At other times, the AI system injected random anecdotes and quotes in a way that didn’t feel entirely natural.At one point, mid-sentence, the AI mentioned the astronaut Scott Kelley and then said “voiceover”, indicating that portion of the argument had been taken from a video transcript. Without hand gestures (well, without hands altogether) or facial expressions, it was also much harder for audience members to stay engaged when listening to the robo-debater.The company has spent six years developing Project Debater’s capabilities, including data-driven speech writing and delivery, listening comprehension for identifying key claims made within a speech, and the ability to formulate principled arguments. It expands upon the capabilities of IBM’s supercomputer Watson, which is being used by companies to mine huge internal data sets – including helping doctors diagnose different types of cancer.The landmark event follows similar battles between man and machine, including IBM’s Deep Blue program beating Gary Kasparov at chess, Google’s AI program AlphaGo beating the world’s best players at the strategy board game Go and a program called Libratus beating four of the world’s top poker players at no-limit Texas Hold ’Em. Using language and reasoning to debate is a far more complicated game. “The rules of chess are very few. The board is very small and the number of pieces is tiny. Even for Go, where the board is substantially larger, we’re still talking about an extremely bounded and well defined space,” said Chris Reed, a professor at the Centre for Argument Technology at the University of Dundee, who attended the debate. “With language, it’s not nearly so clear,” he said. “There’s a lot more flexibility in what constitutes a turn and the rules of the game.”Once an AI is capable of persuasive arguments, it can be applied as a tool to aid human decision-making. “We believe there’s massive potential for good in artificial intelligence that can understand us humans,” said Arvind Krishna, director of IBM Research.One example of this might be corporate boardroom decisions, where there are lots of conflicting points of view. The AI system could, without emotion, listen to the conversation, take all of the evidence and arguments into account and challenge the reasoning of humans where necessary. “This can increase the level of evidence-based decision-making,” said Reed, adding that the same system could be used for intelligence analysis in counter-terrorism, for example identifying if a particular inidual represents a threat.In both cases, the machine wouldn’t make the decision but would contribute to the discussion and act as another voice at the table. While the debate may seem like a stunt, Reed believes it to be an important demonstration of the limits of artificial intelligence. “It helps the public understand where the state of the art is, which means panics about the imminent robot apocalypse might be tempered a little bit,” he said.

Eight decades years later, “dude, where’s my flying car?” is shorthand for any stuff “they” promised us that we haven’t got.We have always wanted to fly, so, as soon as cars came on to the scene, we wanted those to fly too. Early blueprints for the US interstate highway grid even had adjacent runways ready for flying cars. But those never came. Now that concept of the flying “car” seems quaint or naive, a 20th-century dream fuelled by decades of sci-fi and the Jetsons, as obsolete as the model T. Yet as we’ll see, something just as good may take its place. History teaches us that multi-use vehicles are naff. What is a perfect design for an aircraft is not perfect for a car and visa versa. To try to combine the two is what UK design consultant Peter Stevens calls “an inherent, debilitating compromise” – a lesson learned the hard way.Witness the foolhardy Convair Model 118, (1947) – simply a car with plane wings stuck on top. It was forced kicking and screaming into the air on two occasions, with perilous results. This tortured Frankenstein of a contraption is a super-example of why your local bus isn’t amphibious, and why submarines don’t fly. Yet, few people wouldn’t want a personal, car-like flying vehicle that’s comfortable, convenient and liberating. Helicopters don’t really cut it, nor planes you are allowed to drive on a road, an idea making the rounds ever since the admirable but painfully labour-intensive 1950s AeroCar.It’s generally agreed runways are a no-no in most urban environments, so our “car” needs to be capable of quiet, stable, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). A feat that has proven extremely tricky, as SkyCar veteran Paul Moller has found, “nothing comes down faster than a VTOL vehicle upside down”.At present, that means propellers of some sort, but Dekkard’s ride in Blade Runner didn’t look like a giant drone. Similarly, anything with jets stuck on the wings feels like a plane, and besides, no one wants the noise of a Harrier taking off next door. To top it off, VTOL devours fuel as in the absence of a new method of levitation, we are still relying on pushing a lot of air downwards. Technical dilemmas aside, in any future where there are flying cars, everyone will want one: motorway pile-ups are bad enough without the horrors of a 3D version. Autonomy might only be granted to police or other emergency vehicles – as in Blade Runner. So you won’t be a pilot, you’ll be a passenger, in a vehicle hooked to a complex GPS system, a frighteningly clever self-driving AI, and a whole new concept of air traffic control. All of which is difficult, but not impossible.The traffic they could soon be controlling might include some of the following, some of which are like a car, some ... less so.Terrefugia’s Transition: Henry Ford’s “combination aeroplane and motor car” encapsulated. The Massachusetts firm says it’s “the world’s first practical flying car ... making that Jetsons dream a reality”. Downsides: the Transition looks like a plane, takes off on a runway and you still need to be a pilot and at an airport to fly it. That’s a plane – albeit one allowed on the road by dint of folding up its wings like a metal bat. For the same price – about £230,000 – you could get a plane and a nice car. Available in 2019.The Pal V-One drives like a souped-up Sinclair C5 on the road, but then laboriously unfurls cumbersome helicopter rotors and yet still needs a runway to take off. Nope.From Slovakia, AeroMobil’s impressive flying car looks the part, with its super-lightweight, carbon-fibre tuck-in-able wings. But it, too, needs a runway, so it can either be used as a car, or as a plane. Great if you live in the outback otherwise, might as well get a car, and a plane. Toyota is working on a fully electric, VTOL, computer-controlled flying car. At present it looks like some hairdryers nailed to a pallet, but don’t bet against Toyota having something spectacular to show off at the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo.Israel’s Urban Aeronautics’ uses, a more elegant enclosed rotor system on its wingless, computer-controlled Fancraft: “the classic vision of a flying car” (more a flying hovercraft, perhaps). The Israeli military has already snagged the technology for a rather sinister flying tank it calls the AirMule (for use in “search and rescue” where helicopters would be unsuitable). Easy to imagine the police aerially harassing us with one of these within a decade.Two examples share first prize: Terrefugia’s TF-X – an all-electric, AI-controlled, VTOL vehicle that looks much more like that car in your head, but is sadly 10 years away and the temptingly sleek Lilium Jet – the world’s first VTOL electric jet, according the the German tech firm. Faster than a helicopter, quieter than a Harrier jump jet ... even a bit like a car. Finally, no mention of flying cars must pass without an honourable award for gallantry to Paul Moller and his stylish “volantor” – a VTOL plane-like car that started life in 1965 as a drivable flying saucer. Fifty years later, it is still awaiting investment.It’s probably a matter of when, not if, road-based travel becomes obsolete – the likes of Uber already show the will is finally there and the tech is tantalisingly close.Regulatory hurdles aside, we may see VTOLs flying over our cities very soon ... but whether they will allow you to drive one is another thing.

Our crew have an adventurous spirit, sunshine and beer. What could possibly go wrong?‘Don’t hold the sides of the boat, make sure the barrels are firmly tied, and don’t get too drunk.”This was the advice given by my Czech wife just before I set out for my Bohemian canoe trip – advice I remember only as I stand waist-deep in the water, tipsily grappling with an upturned canoe, and watching our belongings disappear down the river.It is my maiden foray into Czech waters, and my first time in a canoe. My companion, Lukaš, is Czech and more athletic than me but also, I realise, hasn’t got the foggiest clue. We are canoeing up the Vltava, a colossal waterway that snakes its way from the forests of southern Bohemia and through Prague before merging with the Elbe in the north. The river bursts into life in the summer, its waters awash with blue-and-white striped sailors in canoes, kayaks and rafts. Our particular stretch is the favoured southern Bohemian part. Between Prague and the Austrian and German borders, it is laden with vast tracts of unspoilt woodland, innumerable fish ponds (where Czech Christmas carp has always been caught) and peppered with Renaissance chateaux. And then there’s the final destination – Český Krumlov, 35km from our starting point at Vyšší Brod. This once-German stronghold is the jewel in southern Bohemia’s crown and the canoeing mecca of the Czech Republic. Every year, paddlers flock there in their thousands to have fun on the river, then a night out in the city.At the riverside, we hire a Canadian-style canoe and two plastic barrels to store our gear in (ingetour.cz, £20 for two days). The rental guy warns us about the more dangerous weirs. “Place your more experienced paddler at the stern,” he says. “If you don’t, you’ll spend your entire trip in a yellow submarine!” (The dominant canoe colour is yellow.)We float through the corridor of lush trees, Lukaš at the front and me at the back, making sure we don’t crash into ducklings. When we reach the first weir, we glide through it so smoothly, we even crack open a can of pilsner to celebrate.The second one, however, poses a problem. Instead of a gentle, PG-rated dip, it is a long, X-rated water slide. Feeling gung-ho, we career down it, tins of lager casually wedged between our knees. Bad move. At the bottom, the boat sways, we both grab the sides, and the canoe capsizes theatrically. Our beers, our shoes, and, more distressingly, our barrels are gone.We start calculating the value of the lost contents. But, mercifully, two kindly men have plucked the barrels out upstream. We buy them an ice-cream to show our gratitude, and they tell us how to tie the barrels to the canoe. Most canoeists, they also explain, get out and inspect each weir before deciding to tackle it. We decide on a different plan – get out and carry our canoe round all of them.During the afternoon, the river is a marvel, a vibrant stream of craft laughing their way downstream, with passersby all greeting one another with an affectionate cry of “Ahoj”. On the water are friends, families, love-struck couples and old men with dogs. For most people, it’s a respite from city life – a sociable summer ritual.“Canoeing is an amazing subculture,” says Ondřej Vach, who is doing the route with his wife and some mates. “Everyone is friendly and willing to help. And all canoeists drink!” He isn’t joking. On most canoes, including his, bottles of tuzemak (rum made from sugar beet) dangle in the water to keep cool, and larger groups link their boats together, with the outside canoeists steering while the rest imbibe in the sun. Having lost our entire alcohol supply to the weir, we stop at a boat bar, a tiny raft anchored in the river, and refresh ourselves with two generous beakers of Cuba Libre.At 6pm, we moor at the route’s halfway point, a campsite called Kemp Branná (tent and two people £6), which has modern showers, a playground and – for the authentic experience – a giant 15-man tipi. Around us, campfires blaze, špekáčky (chunky sausages) are barbecued and guitars strum Czech folk and Beatles songs. The on-site bar is equally lively. While the chef operatically warbles the meal numbers, campers down shots of zelená – a Czech take on crème de menthe – and Becherovka – a Jagermeister-style digestif. After polishing off a hearty plate of halušky – gnocchi with bacon and sheep’s cheese – we sample one of each, then sensibly turn in: we’ve over 15km of Vlatva to do tomorrow. We reach our destination the next morning, and it’s breathtaking. The river skirts Český Krumlov’s old castle walls, where locals line the banks, drinking espresso and watching the boats come in.After tackling one last weir, we return our canoe to Ingetour’s rental shack and check into our rental apartment – a quaint wood-panelled place above the Muzeum Vltavinu (from £50 a night), then meander around Krumlov. One of the country’s most beautiful towns, it glistens in the sunshine.Tiny streets burrow through the terracotta-and-white centre, with cute cafes providing shade from the midday heat. The castle – a gorgeous Unesco-listed site constructed between the 14th and 19th centuries – is a higgledy-piggledy complex perched on a crag. The gothic-turned-Renaissance fortress at the top is a marvel, and tucked within the castle’s baroque gardens is a revolving theatre. In the evening, we head to Le Jardin, Krumlov’s top-rated restaurant and over a delicious lamb rack (£27) and bottle of pinot gris, enthuse about how enjoyable – and easy – our first canoe trip actually was. One altercation with a shoe-stealing weir aside, it had been, well, plain sailing. • Vyšší Brod and Český Krumlov are linked by train from Prague via České Budějovice (3 to 4 hours, from €13).

Given that the job is arguably the most high-profile hosting gig in British political TV, the hunt to find Dimbleby’s replacement is already the subject of rampant speculation, with the great and good of news broadcasting being tipped for the role.What is certain is that whoever takes on the job will follow formidable footsteps: Dimbleby is widely considered to have revived the fortunes of Question Time, which was considered a lame duck when he was appointed in 1994, and the broadcaster has attained a cross-generational cult status in his 25 years at the helm. Here are the runners and riders to replace him.Ahmed has already issued a forthright come-and-get-me plea to the Question Time higher-ups via Twitter, one that does a robust job of pointing out her credentials. “I have 2 awards for journalism, 28 years in the broadcast news biz, including 11 at C4 News, currently presenting @newswatchbbc \u0026amp @BBCFrontRow \u0026amp an honorary fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. I’m v well qualified to present @bbcquestiontime \u0026amp I’d like to be seriously considered,” she wrote. Ahmed has since tweeted that she has been assured she is under consideration, although you suspect that a lack of a blue-chip presenting gig at the BBC might count against her.Arguably the least recognisable figure among the frontrunners, Barnett makes up for her lack of name recognition with a growing reputation as a tough moderator. A former women’s editor at the Daily , she has spent recent years gaining a broadcast education in the bruising world of talk radio, first on LBC and most recently on the mid-morning show on BBC Radio 5 Live. She received rave reviews for her tough interviewing of guests on both sides of the political ide while covering as host of The Andrew Marr Show earlier this year. The former 5 Live host’s transition from radio to television in 2015 was not the easiest. Her daytime show, described by the BBC News chief, James Harding, as the “centrepiece of domestic daytime TV news” before it aired, drew in a paltry 73,000 viewers in its first 10 shows. But since then she has established herself as a daytime alternative to the Jeremy Kyle ratings grabbers. From her background in lifestyle journalism, Derbyshire shifted gears with fearless interviewing (like her set-to with Ken Clarke), which could mean the Question Time bosses see her as authoritative and dogged enough for the BBC’s flagship political debate programme.Could the Channel 4 anchor make the switch back to the beeb? It might not be that much of a leap. Guru-Murthy started his professional life as a host of a debate show on the BBC, but he has a bit of previous when it comes to upsetting Auntie. He was criticised for his grilling of the then BBC One controller Charlotte Moore at the Edinburgh festival in 2014 and his reputation as an aggressive and sometimes ruthless interviewer may not be quite what the Question Time bosses want as they look to transition from an ever-dependable like Dimbleby.Now firmly established as a lead presenter on the Today programme, Husain was promoted to Dimbleby’s main presenting team for the 2017 general election coverage and handed the plum role of conducting the first joint interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle late last year. She would undoubtedly be a progressive choice for a hosting gig that has been exclusively white and male she is currently the 101 joint-third-favourite for the job with Ladbrokes. She has proved adept at keeping politicians in check, too: witness her still impressive shushing of Boris Johnson (“Please stop talking!”) in 2017. Maitlis hit the headlines last summer after interviewing the prime minister in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster and suggesting that she had misread the public anger over the incident. Maitlis had previously spent time at the site sorting donations from members of the public before being told, at short notice, that the prime minister was heading to the BBC for an interview. She has since said her anger was because it “was no longer an intellectual exercise”. A Newsnight host since 2005, Maitlis spent weeks on the road in the US covering the last presidential election and the subsequent fallout after Donald Trump won. At one point, she managed to convince short-lived White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci to appear on the programme by grabbing him as he walked up to the building. A frontrunner for the Question Time job, she has broad name recognition and is not afraid to take controls of a fierce debate.The famously aggressive interviewer quit Newsnight in 2014, but he remains one of the most recognisable current affairs presenters in the UK. Since then, he has dabbled with political programmes on Channel 4 to mixed reviews and continued to present University Challenge on the BBC. However, he also become increasingly critical of the corporation, saying such organisations “are vulnerable to consultants and other snake-oil vendors when the top management hasn’t much clue what day of the week it is”. Paxman lost out to Dimbleby in 1993, the last time the job was up for grabs, and he has made no secret of his desire to do the job. If the corporation decides to go for an established male presenter, it is possible they would consider Andrew Neil, who currently hosts the surreal politics show This Week, which airs after Question Time on Thursday nights.The Newsnight veteran is the clear frontrunner with the bookies to replace Dimbleby. Authoritative, combative when necessary and comfortable interviewing Quentin Tarantino or a world leader, Wark has been one of the BBC’s premier interviewers for more than two decades. A prominent voice in the wage equality debate, she recently spoke about the marginalisation of older women in the media. “Why shouldn’t there be representation of women well into their 70s and beyond?” she asked in 2015. “David Dimbleby is a fine broadcaster, but he’s heading in that direction. So why can’t we have women on television who are also heading in that direction?” There have been loud calls for Dimbleby’s replacement to be a woman and it is hard to see past Wark as the ideal candidate. Who would your choice be?

The man sitting next to me was spouting off whatever he believes, which I don’t agree with, and I was trying to stand up for my views, and the right for women to march.”She suggested men who believed they had a right to give her instructions on her politics should reconsider. “I had men telling me it was my fault he was saying this,” she said. “And I was just like, I’ve had enough of men telling me how I should be a feminist. I’ve had enough of it.”In the interview, Reid also talked about how she considered the presenters on BBC Breakfast – which she quit for the ITV show – more lovable than Morgan. She said: “For me it’s not all about ‘we’ve got to beat them’. I’m quite nervous of conflict, I don’t like it.“I don’t think everybody necessarily wants a double espresso shot straight into their veins in the morning. Some people want a nice cup of tea. And there is absolutely a role for both.”Reid said she had a “constant battle for airtime” with Morgan, because “sometimes I open my mouth to ask a question and hear Piers’s voice come out”.Reid has previously said her outspoken co-host “reduces me to tears”.She told the magazine that when he joined the show “I was like … Arghhh! … sitting next to a hedgehog,” and she struggled with their relationship until early last year.She said she “felt kind of responsible for what he thought” but now realised “he can say anything he likes. I don’t have to pick up the pieces.”Reid said she did not know how much Morgan was paid. He is said to have a bigger salary. “I have no reason to be complaining about my pay. I’m well paid,” Reid said.

Music can provide handy shortcuts in sound to these locations, too. A wobble of surf guitar – wham – you’re in a Pacific picture postcard. A swagger of slow, southern rap – you’re cruising down Ocean Drive. Alongside the tons of sun-spun US classics, there are lesser-known scorchers too, so let’s wind down the windows for all of them, and let the speakers run hot.Let’s begin with the “king of the surf guitar” himself, Dick Dale, who was born in the entirely inappropriate northern outpost of Boston, Massachusetts. Misirlou began life as a slow, Arabic song from the Mediterranean, first released in the US by Turkish singer Theodotos “Tetos” Demetriades in 1927. Dale sped up the track like a Cadillac bombing down an ocean highway. Next up are the Beach Boys – of course – introducing us to the Californian dreams that they made in pop’s early days. Instead of Surfin’ USA and Surfer Girl, enjoy this gorgeous 1963 album track, which summons up the magical aura of American beach life: “Smell the warm and salty air  See a wave reflect a beam ... Make it real your summer dream.”Then let’s have Marlena Shaw, and the west coast’s own surfside creation myth. “And if you listen carefully  The winds that ride  On the high tide  Whistle a melody,” Shaw explains. “So the people started to sing  And that’s how the surf gave birth untold  To California soul.” A dubious theory, Marlena, but when you’re wearing sunglasses, it’s totally convincing. After that euphoric rush, let’s go for full American heat with Jan Hammer’s Miami Vice Theme, guitars forcing balmy winds through your lustrous 80s hair, and hot, shiny synths rolling up your jacket sleeves.Catch your breath with the Thrills – whose Deckchairs and Cigarettes is an ode to the slowed-down loveliness of San Diego and the soft glow of youth – and the beauty of Through My Sails from Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s Zuma. Named after LA’s long, sandy beach, the album ends on this beautiful, seaside song: “I’m standing on the shoreline  It’s so fine out there,” they sing. We hear more of these feelings in Miley Cyrus’s Malibu, from her latest album Younger Now, where peace comes from the ocean, literally and metaphorically: “Next to you  The sky is so blue  In Malibu.”Now it’s time to wind down as the sun slowly sets. Before we do, let’s remember that the biggest summer hit of recent years was made in Miami. The earwormy Spanish guitars and sweet nothings of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito took it to No 1 for a record-breaking 16 weeks in the US. Then we fade out with two more beachside classics, all about the memories and promises the golden shores of America give us: Don Henley’s the Boys of Summer and the Mamas and Papas’ California Dreamin’. Even when the sun goes down, we’ll be safe and warm with these songs. Our love for them will still be strong.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man. So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f916f67ec9607f1256b1f05d945375ed481d1230/0_79_5026_3015/master/5026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91bf68d58a5add873a101d458741d4ac","title":"us immigration border families separated children kirstjen nielsen","story":"Homeland security secretary claims administration is simply enforcing the law as photos and audio of children fuel angerThe Trump administration struggled on Monday to defend its policy of separating parents from their sons and daughters at the southern US border amid growing national outrage and the release of a shocking recording of sobbing children.As the White House scrambled to respond to the deepening political crisis, the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, flew from New Orleans to Washington to face a barrage of questions from reporters, even as Democrats demanded her resignation and the outcry reached a critical mass.Nielsen claimed that America was a country of “compassion” and “heart” but was unable to square the circle regarding whether the separations were a vindication of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy towards illegal immigration or an unintended consequence of a law made by the US Congress.During the West Wing briefing, she did not hear – or ignored – a reporter at the back of the room who played secretly recorded audio, first obtained by ProPublica, in which several Central American children, separated from their parents last week, can be heard crying for their “Mami!” and “Papa!”On the recording, one child says: “I don’t want them to stop my father, I don’t want them to deport him.” A border agent can be heard joking through the wails: “Well, we have an orchestra here, right? ... What we’re missing is a conductor.”Nielsen – who Trump has reportedly criticised in private for failing to tackle border security – told reporters she had not heard the recording.Trump has found himself at the centre of many moral storms since becoming president nearly 18 months ago but they have more often related to words than to actions. The border separations, however, appear to have crossed a new line as the audio recording emerges, as well as harrowing photos of children in tears or in fenced cages, provoking some to draw comparisons with concentration camps.The process has triggered condemnation from four former first ladies: Rosalynn Carter, Laura Bush (who called it “cruel” and “immoral”), Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump. Even the current first lady, Melania Trump, has released a statement saying she “hates to see” children separated from their families.The separations followed the April announcement of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, under which everyone caught crossing the border illegally is to be prosecuted. Consequently, more adults are being jailed, pending trial, and their children are removed from them. Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their families in the past six weeks.She denied that any children had been mistreated and argued: “This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border ... Parents who entered illegally are by definition criminals ... By entering our country illegally often in dangerous circumstances, illegal immigrants have put their children at risk.”The homeland security department, she continued, was merely enforcing the law in a way that past administrations had failed to do. “Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring the law. We are enforcing the laws as they exist on the books.”Nielsen called on Congress to close loopholes in the law so families could stay together. “Congress and the courts created this problem and Congress alone can fix it. Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and security of the United States.”John Kelly, the White House chief of staff and Nielsen’s predecessor at homeland security, told National Public Radio in May that deterrence was “a big part” of the policy. Asked if the situation was therefore playing out as intended, Nielsen replied: “I find that offensive.”Nielsen was followed at the podium by the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, who said the White House would reject a narrow fix by Congress to address the issue and that Trump’s priorities, such as funding a border wall and tightening immigration laws, must also be met. She said: “We want to fix the whole thing, we don’t want to tinker with just part of it.”As the issue overwhelmed TV news networks and threatened to cause lasting damage to America’s reputation abroad, Trump himself weighed in at an event ostensibly promoting his National Space Council. He repeated his past attempt to deflect blame to the Democrats, whom he branded “obstructionists”, and urged them to find a legislative solution.“The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” the president said. “It won’t be. If you look at what’s happening in Europe, if you look at what’s happening in other places, we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.”But Democrats rejected that assertion. Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, responded to Nielsen’s remarks by saying: “This utter lack of compassion and respect for basic human dignity is grotesque. And the blind contempt his staff has shown toward anyone pointing out the truth is a vile disgrace. This is not who we are. The American people are watching.”The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and senators Kamala Harris of California and Tina Smith of Minnesota called on Nielsen to resign. Smith said: “She’s denied that this is happening at all, and then said that she ‘wouldn’t apologize’ for what’s happening to families. Kirstjen Nielsen has lost the credibility and the moral authority to lead this agency.” Immigration is usually a rallying point for the Trump base but even some of his supporters have raised objections to the current action. The Rev Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump ally, said: “It’s disgraceful, and it’s terrible to see families ripped apart, and I don’t support that one bit.” Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s former communications director, told CNN: “I hope he changes it today, frankly. This is very, very bad for the Republican party, and this is bad for the president. I want to see him win re-election.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89413aedd74bf20880740fd9b526995263486712/0_69_4833_2900/master/4833.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd99469170d3f636cca7d5c28f02622a","title":"call me mr president emmanuel macron scolds teenager","story":"Macron told off a teenager during visit to Mont Valerian fort where French resistance members were executed.Like most politicians, French President Emmanuel Macron seems to enjoy pressing the flesh and posing for selfies when on public outings.Just don’t call him by a nickname.A cheeky teen who dared greet him with a breezy “How’s it going, Manu” during an official outing near Paris on Monday was left red-faced after receiving a sharp dressing-down from the 40-year-old centrist.“No, you can’t do that, no, no, no, no,” Macron told the youngster who was waiting with a group of schoolfriends to meet him during his visit to the Mont Valerien fort near Paris, where hundreds of French Resistance members were executed during the second world war.“Sorry, Mr President,” the teenager said, looking abashed.Macron told the teen, who had begun by singing a few lines from the Socialist anthem The Internationale – a dig at the president’s pro-business reforms – to “do things in the right order”.“The day you want to start a revolution you study first in order to obtain a degree and feed yourself, ok? And then you can lecture others,” he said.The exchange, which was captured on camera, was widely shared on social media.It comes as Macron – who adopted a regal, top-down style on taking office – himself faces criticism for his at-times blunt language.In an official video shared by his office last week he complained that the French were spending a “crazy amount of dough” on social security.Macron’s critics held the video up as evidence that the man they call the “president of the rich” lacked empathy with the poor.Last year, Macron also raised the hackles of the left by calling protesting opponents of his labour reforms “slackers”.

The airlines are not the only international carriers who have made the change recently, with Australia’s Qantas earlier this month defending its decision to list Taiwan as part of China.The Chinese civil aviation administration sent a notice to 36 foreign airlines in April, asking them to comply with Beijing’s standard of referring to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as Chinese territories.Japan’s ties with China are improving after years of acrimony over historical and territorial issues. Japan has close business ties with Taiwan but has acknowledged the “One China” policy, which describes Taiwan as an integral part of China.Asked about the change, Yoshihide Suga, a top Japanese government spokesman, said Tokyo was “not in favour of government authorities demanding certain measures from private companies based on a specific political stance.”“The government has expressed Japan’s interest in this issue on the Chinese side,” he added.

Brussels, meanwhile, is seeking to keep Britain under the jurisdiction of the European court of human rights by stipulating that any deal for police and security co-operation between the UK and EU will depend on it.‘Not on my watch’ – Donald Trump has said the US will not become a “migrant camp” like Europe as his administration faces heavy criticism for separating nearly 2,000 children from their parents in just the past six weeks. Hillary Clinton accused Trump of using “frightened children as a negotiating tool”. Trump is pressuring Democrats to negotiate with Republicans on funding for his border wall and tighter immigration restrictions, in exchange for protections for young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers.Rapper gunned down – The rap artist XXXTentacion, real name Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, has been shot and killed in Florida.

The rapper was briefly taken off Spotify when the alleged assault came to light.Faff diets – “How to cook eggs in bulk in an oven.” Just one tip from the world of “meal prep” where you get all your clean-eating-paleolithic-Atkins-intermittent-fasting food for the week ready in one go, pack it into plastic containers that are preferably colour-coded … then put it on Instagram. “It is favoured by those who wish to control portion size and calorie consumption and those following, say, a high-protein diet,” explains Laura Barton.“Wellness bloggers”, fitness preeners and other opportunists of the internet have not taken long to invade the turf. But total cynicism might be unjustified. “It’s sort of Lego cooking, isn’t it?” says the food writer Matthew Fort. “But anything that encourages people to cook meals from scratch must be a good thing.”‘Terrible human consequences’ – A record 16.2 million people were forced to flee their homes in 2017, according to the UN refugee agency. Syria topped the list followed by Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia. Around the world there are 68.5 million displaced people – more than the total population of the UK.

Photograph: iStockThe Health Service Executive (HSE) has spent an estimated €207,000 on male breast reduction operations over the past four years.Gynaecomastia – colloquially known as “man boobs” – is swelling of the breast tissue in men or boys, caused by an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone.Figures provided by the HSE in response to a written Dáil question by Fianna Fáil’s Robert Troy TD on the issue show that between 2014 and the end of August last, the HSE had carried out 46 gynaecomastia operations.The figures show that between January and August last year, the HSE performed nine elective procedures 12 elective and one emergency procedure in 2016 10 elective procedures in 2015 and 14 elective procedures in 2014.In its written reply to Mr Troy, the HSE said those who underwent surgery were usually treated by a general breast surgeon or plastic surgeon.According to Dr Peter Prendergast, medical director at the privately owned Venus Medical in Dublin, he performs 20-30 cases of male breast reduction annually and the number is growing.“I meet several men every week who are extremely concerned about the appearance of their breasts. They wear loose, baggy clothes to conceal the contour of their chest. They avoid beaches,” he said.“They are embarrassed when they are with their partners or even children, who often, innocently, pass remarks. Surgery on these patients, whether excisional surgery or liposuction, is often indicated and can be life-changing for them.”Dr Prendergast said men continued to be “extremely” embarrassed by their gynaecomastia.“The number is growing in my practice as more men become aware of the possibility of improving the appearance of their chests without the need for surgery that requires general anaesthesia. Men also realise that it is a very common concern, and nothing to be ashamed about.”Dr Prendergast said: “Up to 30 per cent of men have enlarged breasts and many of them are extremely bothered by their appearance. For some, it is true gynaecomastia, where the actual breast gland is enlarged. Others have so-called pseudogynaecomastia where there is simply excessive fatty tissue in the chest. It is often very resistant to diet and exercise, and the only remedy for aesthetically acceptable results is surgery.”Dr Prendergast said the cost of each procedure, which takes an hour, was about €4,500. “Apart from wearing a special compression garment and taking mild pain relief, the recovery is quick and most men return to work within two or three days.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Children with overbearing parents less able to deal with challenging demands of growing upCharlie Flanagan also seeking approval for referendum on issue of blasphemyIf an internal Garda candidate is chosen, appointment likely to go ahead in AugustSiofra Coffey\u0026rsquos husband died of a brain tumour less than three years agoSeparating children from parents as part of border controls \u0026lsquoimmoral and shocking\u0026rsquoCriminal Law Act 1993 that criminalised gay men was \u0026lsquocontrary to human dignity\u0026rsquoSpiritans, founders of Blackrock College and Rockwell, to shut Marian House in DublinScout body prepares for redundancies and creditors calling in loans as fund crisis loomsThink-tank urges Coalition to avoid overheating economy but plays down fears of house-price bubble\u0026lsquoI want to genuinely reach out to our minority communities and show them the hand of friendship\u0026rsquo says DUP leaderThe number of physical attacks reported on trains increased from nine to 43 last yearDublin man apologises for his actions and has since repaid the money to the storeReaching climate targets is at the top of the policy agenda for Government, says MinisterThe commitments, how we rate on efforts to curb this rolling disaster and the carbon taxDocument outlines Karen Bradley\u0026rsquos responses to media questionsNew facility will cater for larger container ships than are currently accommodated at Tivoli when it opens in 2020Researchers call for marital status to be included as risk factor in its own rightRobin Walker said he hoped a new security partnership with the EU would ensure the Garda and the PSNI continue to co-operate"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3535174.1529348439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scouting ireland faces having to put staff on notice","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tScouting Ireland estimates it has two months before funding runs out, after Minister for Children Katherine Zappone suspended  finance in April, following the organisation’s handling of a rape allegation.Scouting Ireland has warned it will be forced to place all its 34 staff on protective notice in the coming days, as the organisation faces a funding crisis.It estimates it only has two months before funding runs out, after Minister for Children Katherine Zappone suspended State finance in April, following the organisation’s handling of a rape allegation made in 2016.In an email to its membership, Martin Burbridge, a former chief scout who is overseeing the organisation’s response, warned it will run out of money by late July or early August if State funding was not restored.The consequences of having to let go all 34 professional staff, who are entitled to eight weeks’ notice, would mean all national events, including an international camp due to take place in Stradbally, Co Laois, next month, would have to be cancelled.The organisation has also has set aside emergency funds in the eventuality any creditors call in their loans.Scouting Ireland has an annual income of about €3.5 million, including State funding worth nearly €1 million a year, with the rest coming from members’ subscription fees. State funding for the second half of the year worth €438,169 is being withheld.The correspondence, seen by The , said Scouting Ireland has had to set aside more than €1 million to prepare for redundancies.If the organisation is forced to lay off all staff, “it is possible that the insurers would refuse to continue to provide cover” to its 40,000 juvenile members and 13,000 adult volunteers, Mr Burbridge said.An international “Jamborí” camp set to host 5,000 scouts in Stradbally this July, that has been organised over several years, “could not proceed” without national staff, he said.The organisation also has significant loans it is repaying, including for a recent €1m refurbishment of its headquarters in Larch Hill, south Co Dublin.The organisation needs to ring-fence money to cover potential redundancies and fully repay creditors, Mr Burbridge said.Failure to do so could leave board members open to “the possibility of criminal charges” and reckless trading penalties levelled against the company, Mr Burbridge said in his email.The picture painted of the organisation’s future was not “scaremongering”, Mr Burbridge told members, adding “it is because of issues like those I describe below that businesses fail”.The controversy began after a confidential report by safeguarding expert Ian Elliott found Scouting Ireland’s handling of a rape allegation made in 2016 was “deeply flawed”.It is understood Ms Zappone’s move to suspend funding related largely to how the board responded to Mr Elliott’s report.Four senior volunteers criticised in Mr Elliott’s review have temporarily stepped aside pending the findings of an internal inquiry being carried out by barrister Lorna Lynch. The volunteers have defended their actions.To address Ms Zappone’s concerns about how the organisation is run, an extraordinary general meeting to vote on an overhaul of Scouting Ireland’s governance structures will be held on June 30th.Proposals to be voted on would change how the board is made up and introduce independent directors. Approving the reforms “would go a long way to satisfying the Minister”, Mr Burbridge said.The correspondence comes amid heated internal isions over the reforms, with senior Dublin members backing a statement calling for the meeting to be postponed until Ms Lynch’s inquiry is completed.Ms Zappone appointed former Independent senator Jillian Van Turnhout to review the governance of Scouting Ireland. Her report and the egm vote will inform the decision on whether to restore State funding, expected shortly."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3535850.1529392675!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two in three leave voters prefer hard border to staying in customs union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn anti-Brexit demonstrator looks pensive during a protest outside the Houses of Parliament on June 11th in London. Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesTwo out of three British voters who backed Brexit would prefer to see a hard border in Ireland than for Britain to remain in the EU customs union, according to a new poll. Only one in three British voters said they could not accept a different status for Northern Ireland after Brexit and six out of 10 Leave voters said that leaving the EU was more important than keeping the United Kingdom together.The poll by Conservative peer Michael Ashcroft found that, given a straight choice between a hard border and remaining in the customs union, 41 per cent of all voters would choose a hard border compared to 32 per cent who would remain in the customs union. Leave voters would choose a hard border by 66 per cent to 10 per cent and Conservative voters would make the same choice by 67 per cent to 14 per cent.Remain voters would stay in the customs union rather than see a hard border by 55 per cent to 21 per cent and Labour voters would make the same choice by 47 per cent to 25 per cent.Writing in the Daily , Lord Ashcroft said that most British voters thought Brexit was taking too long, with Leave voters often blaming those who want to soften or delay Britain’s exit from the EU.“Given these views - impatience with the process, determination for the UK to operate an independent trade policy, and the suspicion that Brexit opponents are deliberately throwing up hurdles - it is not hard to imagine how Leave voters would react if told the UK would not be taking back as much control as they hoped because of the Irish border, an issue they believe is being blown out of proportion,” he wrote.Lord Ashcroft’s poll found that, asked to choose between keeping the UK together and leaving the EU, 63 per cent of British voters would leave the EU, compared with 27 per cent who would keep the UK together. Among Conservative voters, 73 per cent would choose leaving the EU with just 22 per cent saying they would keep the UK together. Labour voters would choose leaving the EU over keeping the UK together by 50 per cent to 34 per cent.“Those who have pondered Brexit’s consequences for UK union have usually focused on the resentment felt in places where majorities voted to remain in the EU,” Lord Ashcroft wrote.“But there is another risk: that a question like the Irish border, which most Leave voters see as a relatively minor practical issue that could be resolved, should prevent the majority getting the Brexit they think they voted for.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

A troupe of scantily clad dancers is then seen swaying sensually in front of The Coronation of Napoleon.It quickly becomes apparent that the two most prominent African Americans in pop culture are also making a deliberate statement on the marginalisation of black figures in predominantly white Western art.Close-ups single out black figures in Veronese’s Wedding at Cana, as well as Géricaults The Raft of the Medusa and Marie-Guillemine Benoist’s Portrait of a Negress painted between French revolutionaries’ abolition of slavery in 1794 and Napoleon’s restoration of it in 1802.The Louvre said it was happy to hire out the museum to the music megastars Beyonce and Jay-Z as they were genuine fans of the museumThe clip features scenes of a woman combing a man’s hair with an afro pick in front of the Mona Lisa, while Beyoncé sings “can’t believe we made it”, serenely seated in a long cream dress before the Winged Victory.As critic Jason Farago put it: “As so often, the couple here present themselves as both outsiders in an elite institution and as heirs to it as people excluded from its narratives but now possessors of it by virtue of their talent, their taste and, well, their money.”“It’s a political clip,” Gert Van Overloop, manager of the video’s choreographer, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. “All the dancers are black, most of the Louvre works are seen through this prism. It’s not a clip against, in the sense of revenge, but a clip to affirm the equality between Afro-American culture and more generally black, with white culture.”Most French critics were wowed. “Breathtaking,” wrote Le Parisien, the capital’s daily, even if it questioned whether the video verged on “megalomania”. “Grandiose,” wrote conservative Le Figaro. Totally sublime, said Europe 1 radio. Libération suggested the pair had even outdone in hutspah other famous pop couples John Lennon and Yoko Ono or June Carter and Johnny Cash.The Louvre has been the scene of many music clips and films, including The Smurfs 2Quizzed on its decision to hire out the museum for the clip, Louvre management said the singers were real art fans. “Beyonce and Jay-Z have visited the Louvre four times in the past ten years. During their last visit in May, they raised this idea of a shoot, it wrote. The timing was tight, but the project quickly won us over, because the synopsis showed a real attachment to the museum and its works, which made a mark on them.Even the normally stuffy La Tribune de L’Art saw nothing wrong with the Carters taking over the Louvre, as long, it said, as the museum wasn’t specifically shut for the occasion or the works “placed under threat” - neither the case.Beyonce and Jay-Z\u0026#39s video Apeshit homes in on black figures in the Louvre\u0026#39s art worksThe art blog pointed out that the Louvre has long been open to music and film shoots, such as the Da Vinci Code, Wonder Woman, and even The Smurfs 2. Rates are relatively low, with the top fee only €15,000 (£13,150) for a full day’s shoot in the galleries.“The only disconcerting thing here is the hopelessness of the music and the vulgarity of the singers,” it wrote. Far more “shameful”, it argued, was the Louvre\u0027s sale of “mugs and Mona Lisa Rubik\u0027s cubes” in close proximity to the world’s greatest masterpieces.Comment: The war on cannabis has failed utterly.

At the Serpentine Swimming Club, where members must now swim down a narrow channel and avoid bumping into the platform that keeps the 600-tonne structure afloat, there were plenty of both.“It casts a shadow on the water. We’re swimming in gloom,” complained one regular.“It’s an affront to nature,” said another, referring to the red, blue and mauve colour scheme that Christo said he had carefully chosen in relationship to the surroundings.Christo says his 600-tonne work is designed \u0026#39to make us think\u0026#39The Bulgarian-American artist has positioned the sculpture directly opposite the bank where the swimmers enter the water because there it can be seen from the maximum number of viewing points within the park.For every swimmer who described it as “hideous”, “intrusive” and an “ego trip” for the artist, there was another who loved it.“It makes a change from the wildlife. I’m all in support of good art,” said one, while a friend said: “There was a beautiful colour to the water this morning from the reflection.”A passing dog-walker said the structure was a hit with her cockapoo “because it keeps the ducks away and she can go in the water”.Christo, 83, has given no explanation for his work, simply saying it is designed to make people think. “To think - that is what makes us human,” he said.This is his first large-scale work on Britain. He has previously wrapped Berlin’s Reichstag and Paris’s Pont-Neuf in fabric.The temporary work is in place over the course of the summer Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who now chairs the Serpentine Gallery, said: “The London Mastaba will bring all the benefits that come with great public art. It will add new energy to the city, it will help people see the familiar in a new light and provoke conversation and debate.“I think it’s fair to say that no two people will have the same reaction to it, and that’s exactly how great art should be.”Mr Bloomberg claimed that, according to one estimate from the London School of Economics, the sculpture could generate £150 million for the economy through increased tourism.Loyd Grossman, chairman of the Royal Parks, said the sculpture will bring “an immense amount of joy and inspiration” to visitors.It is in place for three months, and people can rent a boat on the lake to take a closer look.Christo - who long ago discarded his full name, Christo Vladimirov Javacheff - self-funds his projects through the sale of his work. No public money is used and he does not accept sponsorship.While The London Mastaba is one of the biggest sculptures to appear in London, for Christo it will soon be small fry. His next mastaba will be 10 times larger, sited in Abu Dhabi and dwarfing the largest Egyptian pyramid.Comment: The war on cannabis has failed utterly.

The initiative claims graphene applications like Earthdas\u0027 will generate economic growth, new jobs and new opportunities for Europeans.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It took four days for the government’s\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce to intervene so she could return home.\u0026nbspMs Bhanote, who has three children and four grandchildren in the UK and worked as a\u0026nbsppost office assistant, told The Independent she felt “terrible”, adding: “I spoke to someone on the phone who refused to speak to my family and could not understand why they were behaving in such a disrespectful manner towards me.”Her son,\u0026nbspArun\u0026nbspBhanote, has since written to his MP to request an investigation by the Home Office into what he described as “racist maladministration and xenophobic calamity”.Satbir\u0026nbspSingh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said the case was a “disturbing but sadly all-too-common occurrence”.“Cases like this show just how incredibly complicated, rigid and inhumane our immigration system has become,” he said.\u0026nbsp“It’s a relief that the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce was able to help in this case, but it also shows the need for such remedies to be available to everybody who faces poor decision-making either at the Home Office or at the border.”It comes as the government announced that a\u0026nbspday celebrating the Windrush generation and their descendants was\u0026nbspto be held annually, after it emerged a large number of\u0026nbspBritish\u0026nbspCaribbean\u0026nbspnationals had been wrongly targeted by immigration officials in the UK.But Alessandra\u0026nbspSciarra, from Lewisham Refugee and Migrant Centre, which supports migrants and refugees in south London, said they had seen at least a dozen cases of non-Caribbean Commonwealth citizens encountering\u0026nbspsimilar issues\u0026nbspin the past six months.“They extend to people from different countries it’s much more widespread.\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspis just the tip of the iceberg,” she said.Ms Sciarra\u0026nbspsaid one of their cases involved a 65-year-old Indian man who was born in Uganda and became a British protected person after fleeing persecution to the UK in 1972.\u0026nbspDespite living here since, working and building a family, and never encountering any issues with his immigration status, he has recently been unable to find work due to issues with his documents.“In the 46 years he has been living in the UK, he has integrated successfully into his community in Lewisham. His wife and adult children were all recognised as British citizens,” she\u0026nbspsaid.“But recently Mr Khan lost his job and began looking for employment again just prior to retirement. He faced numerous issues in this process, as many employers asked him for a proof of his right to reside and work in the country.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said one of her constituents, of Ghanaian descent who has been in Britain for over 50 years, had recently contacted her after had been threatened with deportation.The Labour MP said: “The Windrush scandal goes way beyond the people that stepped off Empire Windrush or even all those from the Caribbean. Everyone from the Commonwealth who came here before 1973 could get caught up in the scandal, including deportation or detention.“These are not isolated mistakes. They are a product of the government’s ‘hostile environment’ policy, and Theresa May’s instruction to ‘deport first, appeal later’. Until these end, the scandal will not go away.”The Home Office declined to disclose the exact number of non-Caribbean cases​​ the taskforce was dealing with.Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said his office received on average three cases a week – or around 150 a year – from Indian nationals who have lived in the UK for more than a decade but are now denied their rights and in some cases threatened with deportation.“It is not just Windrush cases,” he said.\u0026nbsp“There is a systemic failure on the part of the Home Office to deal with cases promptly. Delay is being used as a substitute for decision-making.“There are a lot of people who are from India who have been in this country for 20 years, but are being held in a long queue being made to sign on and\u0026nbspcannot work, but are actually entitled to stay here.“As a result, people can stay for a very long time – as long as 20 years – and still not know precisely where they stand. Some inevitably\u0026nbspget removed without anyone intervening. They live in a subculture of society\u0026nbspand so are reluctant to come forward, but actually they do have the right to stay.”Mr Vaz raised concerns that the Home Office had “erted resources” from dealing with immigration cases from the Indian subcontinent in order to set up the Windrush\u0026nbsptaskforce.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

He finished more than 12 points ahead of former guerrilla Gustavo Petro, though the runner-up\u0027s performance at the ballot box was the best ever for the left in one of Latin America\u0027s most conservative nations.\u0026nbspWhen Mr Duque, of the Democratic Centre\u0026nbspparty, takes office in August at age 42\u0026nbsphe will be Colombia\u0027s youngest president in more than a century and in his first remarks as president-elect he vowed to work tirelessly to heal isions and govern on behalf of all Colombians.He also promised a frontal attack on corruption while addressing a surge in cocaine production that he called a threat to national security.\u0026nbspThis is the opportunity that we have been waiting for – to turn the page on the politics of polarisation, insults and venom, Mr Duque told jubilant supporters Sunday night, joined by his young family.\u0026nbspThe election was the first since outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos signed the 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the race ultimately ended up being defined by the isive accord.\u0026nbspMr Duque\u0027s promise to heal the scars from five decades of bloody conflict will demand a quick response. The FARC rebels who demobilized under the accord are struggling to reinsert themselves into civilian life in a nation where many people are hesitant to forgive. Vast swaths of remote territory remain under the control of violent drug mafias and residual rebel bands.\u0026nbspPeople stare at damages caused by mudslides following heavy rains in Mocoa, Putumayo department, southern Colombia.

Although with this result, it\u0027s proven that Colombia is still a right-wing country.\u0026nbspMr Petro took his loss in stride, refusing to call it a defeat. In a concession speech that at times sounded celebratory, he challenged Mr Duque to break with his hard-line allies, and Mr\u0026nbspUribe in particular. He also promised to mobilise his considerable following into a combative opposition that will fight for social reforms and defend the peace accord.\u0026nbspThose eight million Colombians are not going to let Colombia return to war, Mr Petro said to a thunderous applause from supporters chanting Resistance!\u0026nbspColombia\u0027s peace process to end a conflict that caused more than 250,000 deaths is considered largely irreversible. Most of the more than 7,000 rebels who have surrendered their weapons have started new lives as farmers, community leaders and journalists. Last year the rebels launched a new political party and will soon occupy 10 seats in congress.\u0026nbspBut the accord remains contentious and Mr Duque pledged throughout his campaign to make changes that would deliver peace with justice. Through constitutional reform or by decree, he could proceed with proposals such as not allowing ex-combatants behind grave human rights abuses to take political office until they have confessed their war crimes and compensated victims.\u0026nbspThe current agreement allows most rebels to avoid jail, a sore point for many.\u0026nbspMr Duque\u0027s detractors warn that his victory could throw an already delicate peace process into disarray.\u0026nbspI think it will set up a big constitutional battle, said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America programme at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.\u0026nbspFARC leaders apologise for war crimesMr Duque is the son of a former governor and energy minister who friends say has harboured presidential aspirations since he was a child. The father-of-three entered public service almost two decades ago as an adviser to the man he will succeed a president, Mr Santos, who was then Colombia\u0027s finance minister.\u0026nbspHe later moved to Washington, where he spent more than a decade at the Inter-American Development Bank, first as an adviser for three Andean countries and later as chief of the cultural ision.\u0026nbspIt was during that time that Mr Duque forged a close relationship with Mr Uribe, the torchbearer of conservatives who is both adored and detested by legions of Colombians.\u0026nbspWith Mr Uribe\u0027s backing,\u0026nbspMr Duque was elected to Colombia\u0027s Senate in 2014. He earned a reputation as a like-minded security hawk who did his homework and earned the respect of colleagues across the political spectrum.\u0026nbspThroughout his campaign, Mr Duque was dogged by accusations he would be little more than a puppet for Mr Uribe, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Though praised for weakening the FARC and drawing record foreign investment, the former president\u0026nbsphas also been blamed for the military\u0027s killing of thousands of civilians who were falsely portrayed as rebels to inflate body counts.\u0026nbspTowards the end of his victory speech, Mr Duque thanked Mr Uribe but said he would strive to bridge Colombia\u0027s isions. He stuck to his message of peace, saying\u0026nbsphe wants to see rank-and-file guerrilla members succeed in civilian life and become part of a growing Colombian economy.\u0026nbspI\u0027m not going to govern with hatred, he said. Neither in my mind nor my heart is there a desire for revenge and retaliation.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

China is North Korea\u0027s most important diplomatic and economic backer but has been angered by Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear and missile tests.Police tightened security along Beijing\u0027s main Changan Avenue, which leads to the Great Hall of the People where Chinese leaders normally meet visiting heads of state, and also outside the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where Kim stayed with his wife during his March visit to Beijing.Outside the east gate of the Great Hall, where foreign leaders are officially welcomed, authorities had erected a screen running the full length of the road, cutting off the view behind it.China has welcomed the warming of ties between Washington and Pyongyang, and offered to help.Beijing has been particularly pleased by Trump\u0027s announcement to suspend military drills, which China has long pushed for under its dual suspension proposal, whereby North Korea stops weapons tests and the United States and South Korea stop military drills, so both sides can sit down for talks.South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend all planning activities regarding the Freedom  military drill scheduled for August, according to a South Korean defence ministry statement.A Pentagon statement confirmed the suspension and added that there would be a meeting between the secretaries of defence and state as well as Trump\u0027s national security adviser on the issue this week.North and South Korea agree to joint teams for Asian GamesUS and South Korea \u0027poised to halt war games within days\u0027Asia\u0027s fine balance of military power is about to change completelyTrump salutes North Korea general in exchange aired on state televisonMike Pompeo says no sanctions relief until North Korea denuclearises Last year, 17,500 American and more than 50,000 South Korean troops participated in the Ulchi Freedom  drills, although the exercise is mostly focused on computerized simulations rather than live field exercises that use weapons, tanks or aircraft.The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month.The decision to halt military exercises in South Korea has bewildered many current and former U.S. defence officials, who only learned about it when Trump made his remarks after the Singapore meeting.Japan\u0027s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday there would be no changes to joint drill plans between the United States and Japan, both of which also engage in regular deterrence exercises against North Korea.The United States is in a position to keep its commitment to its allied nations\u0027 defence and our understanding is there is no change to the U.S. commitment to the Japan-U.S. alliance and the structure of American troops stationed in Japan, Suga said in a regular briefing.The Pentagon has yet to publicly release the cost of previous and future joint military exercises with South Korea, a week after Trump cited their tremendously expensive cost as a reason for halting them.Spending data for previous military exercises in Korea and elsewhere, however, suggest that the cost of a single exercise would be in the low or perhaps tens of millions of dollars in a U.S. military budget this year of nearly $700 billion.In response to repeated requests for cost data, Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, said: We are currently evaluating the costs of the exercises.Calculating the cost of military exercises is a complicated process, often requiring data from different branches of the military and spread over several budgets over different years.Troops who would have been involved in the exercises would still require training and certification, which would still cost money, said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia under President Barack Obama.To me, the idea of this as a cost saving measure doesn\u0027t really make much sense, Denmark said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The latest agreement comes as Washington looks to press ahead with further talks with Pyongyang about the status of their nuclear weapons programme.Both sides agreed at a round of talks on their heavily fortified border to hold a series of basketball matches in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang on 3 July\u0026nbspto 6 July.“The South and the North will continue to form unified teams for other international sporting events... while holding joint training to strengthen inter-Korea cooperation and exchanges,” a statement put out by the countries said.Meanwhile, the Korean athletes at the 2018 Asian Games will march together at the opening and closing ceremonies under a unified flag, as they did at the recent Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.\u0026nbsp“Today\u0027s meeting was to follow up on the achievement we made during the recent Olympics by boosting more regular, various sports exchanges including friendly matches, joint participation in global events and joint training,” said Lee Hae-don, a South Korean official who participated in the talks at the border\u0026nbspvillage of Panmunjom.World news in picturesResidents pass by a temple gate collapsed by an earthquake in Ibaraki, Osaka Prefecture, western Japan.

Combined, they make up one in every 110 people on the planet.Just over 16.2 million were freshly forced from their homes in 2017 alone, meaning that a new person became displaced every two seconds. And the number of asylum-seekers, trapped in limbo awaiting the outcome of their claims, rose above 3 million.But the global scale of the problem is not being matched by an international response, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi.Refugee children abused and illegally returned at France-Italy borderRohingya facing ‘crisis on top of crisis’ as world looks other wayMyanmar says it is willing to take back all Rohingya refugeesSyria’s new housing law will displace tens of thousands of refugeesPolice clear migrants from biggest illegal camp in ParisHungary considering making offering food to refugees illegalVast numbers of refugees are living in just a handful of countries closest to conflict zones, with the likes of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Uganda and Bangladesh taking people in at far higher rates than the global average.“We are at a watershed, where success in managing forced displacement globally requires a new and far more comprehensive approach so that countries and communities aren’t left dealing with this alone,” Mr Grandi said.Mr Grandi also highlighted the helplessness of those who had “no choice” but to flee their homes. Of the global displaced population, a staggering 53 per cent are children. Their number, the UN said, includes many who are unaccompanied or separated from their families.And among the specific case studies highlighted by the report were the Rohingya, 655,000 of whom fled Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh in the space of just three months from late August 2017.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspA senior UN official has previously described violence towards the Rohingya by the Myanmar army as a “textbook case of ethnic cleansing”. The government of Myanmar has for generations refused to acknowledge the Muslim minority’s right to citizenship in northern Rakhine state, insisting they are illegal immigrants from neighbouring states.“Nowhere is the link between statelessness and displacement more evident than for the Rohingya community of Myanmar, for whom denial of citizenship is a key aspect of the entrenched discrimination and exclusion that have shaped their plight for decades,” Mr Grandi said.Life in a Palestinian refugee campAhmed Nabeel, 19, was born in the camp and now works as a welderThree boys sit on a wall watching what is going on in the campPiles of rubbish are a direct result of US president Donald Trump cutting funds to UNRWAA young girl runs down one of the main streets to the marketplaceA boy pretends his cigarette cards are Jordanian dinar Mohammed Saeed, 12, helps the elderly cart their shopping back to their homesUnrest in the camp, where many are living below the poverty lineAlleyways where waste is left attract rats and cause illnessIbrahim Bassam, 11, spends his time playing with friends in mounds of rubbishMuhand Salem, 22, a university student studying mechanical engineering, one of very few scholarships available to refugeesNabeel Salem, 62, arrived in the camp at the age of 12 and still recalls his father telling him not to pack too many of his clothes and toys because they wouldn’t be there longAhmed Nabeel, 19, was born in the camp and now works as a welderThree boys sit on a wall watching what is going on in the campPiles of rubbish are a direct result of US president Donald Trump cutting funds to UNRWAA young girl runs down one of the main streets to the marketplaceA boy pretends his cigarette cards are Jordanian dinar Mohammed Saeed, 12, helps the elderly cart their shopping back to their homesUnrest in the camp, where many are living below the poverty lineAlleyways where waste is left attract rats and cause illnessIbrahim Bassam, 11, spends his time playing with friends in mounds of rubbishMuhand Salem, 22, a university student studying mechanical engineering, one of very few scholarships available to refugeesNabeel Salem, 62, arrived in the camp at the age of 12 and still recalls his father telling him not to pack too many of his clothes and toys because they wouldn’t be there longThe UN report does conclude with what Mr Grandi calls a “reason for some hope”, however, pointing towards a shared agreement currently being drafted by the UN in response to the global refugee crises. Dubbed the Global Compact on Refugees, it would see displaced people resettled more equitably and put in place basic standards for things like healthcare access from the moment refugees cross into another country.“Today, on the eve of World Refugee Day, my message to member states is please support this,” Mr Grandi said. “No one becomes a refugee by choice but the rest of us can have a choice about how we help.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres what you need to know.Marijuana, or cannabis, is the most consumed illegal drug in the UK.It is commonly ingested by smoking but for medical purposes it can also be taken in oil or pill form.Low concentrated versions of cannabis oil are widely available in British pharmacies.Makers say it can be used to help promote sleep, boost appetite and reduce stress, anxiety and depression.Higher concentrated forms of cannabis oil have also been hailed for treating the symptoms of epilepsy, HIV and cancer.But cannabis oil with more than 0.05 per cent THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) - the psychoactive element - is banned in the UK despite high-profile cases like Billy Caldwell.The 12-year-old was given a 20-day exemption to take higher strength cannabis oil to treat his severe epilepsy.Sativex is one of a very few drugs containing cannabis-derived THC and CBD (Cannabidiol) - another less potent ingredient - that can be prescribed on the NHS.It is used to relieve the pain of muscle spasms for sufferers of multiple sclerosis.Use of Sativex is currently limited to those people who respond to the first four weeks of treatment.However NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, does not recommend its prescription.In a 2014 clinical guideline update, NICE said: The guidance does not recommend the use of the cannabinoid drug Sativex or fampridine as they provide only a modest benefit at a significant cost to the NHS.Sativex costs £50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), while fampridine costs in the region of £160,000 per QALY.Both are well above NICE’s threshold of £30,000 per QALY.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is the chicken theyre selling at Coles. As it turns out, the bizarre colour change is rather common and caused by intense contractions of the breast fillet and tender, the parts responsible for flapping the wings.The tender is more vulnerable to the condition because it is surrounded by a tough inelastic muscle, according to an academic report.It said the initial damage turns the muscle red at first as the ruptured blood vessels in the tender haemorrhage.The Mississippi study added: Over the next few days, the tender gradually begins to take on a bruised or discoloured look associated with necrosis.As time passes (perhaps a week or even longer after the initial event), the tender takes on the characteristic green colour for which the condition is named.A spokeswoman for Coles told news.au they had contacted Ferguson and offered her a full refund or replacement.She said the quality of the supermarket’s products is very important and encouraged anyone who encountered an item they were not 100 per cent happy with to return it.It’s not the first time a chicken from Coles was cut open and dinner immediately ruined. In 2016, social media blew up over claims a chicken appears to have gangrene.A Coles spokesman reassured those concerned that it was DPM.Researchers have noted that cases of DPM are increasing but “the lesion does not impair the general health of birds and is generally found during cut-up and deboning”.A version of this story first appeared on news.au"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414269547.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"frankies new world order brings me out in noyles","story":"Probably not.But the answer’s there for you anyway, if you want to see, at 10pm, BBC2, Friday.It’s called Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and is officially classed, by listings, as a “comedy”, even though it’s nothing of the sort.That’s just a Get Out Of Jail card for BBC2, because New World Order is very obviously a political discussion show featuring a host and four guests who represent every possible shade of opinion, from the hard left to the extreme left.Typically, these will be Sara Pascoe, Katherine Ryan,  statistics expert Mona Chalabi, who’s as funny as her job suggests, and a token male in Miles Jupp or David Baddiel, whose purpose is to sit there, furiously agreeing with everything the women say.Starting point here will be a “light-hearted” subject that plays to the collective bias.One week, for instance, it was “Donald Trump will be the first crowd-funded assassination”.A move the panel eventually seemed to rule out, not on the grounds it’s morally wrong, but that it would: “Make him a martyr.”On the eve of Harry and Meghan’s wedding it was “We have 12 hours to abolish the monarchy”, which ended with a huge round of applause for Frankie’s suggestion of “executing them”.If you’re waiting for me here to tell you one person demurred or looked a bit ashamed, you haven’t been watching BBC comedy recently.There is no shame or opposition these days, least of all from the host, who’s made one of the more remarkable transformations of recent times.Just eight years ago, Frankie was telling jokes about disabled children, now here he is, via a column in , preaching about “the inhumanity of the Tories” and parading his apparent concerns for the children of Palestine.Remarkable, but I guess that’s what happens if the BBC decide you’re “One of us”.You get your own show and a stand-up slot at the beginning of each episode, where Frankie settles scores in his usual gear-crunching style.Targets may be Brexit, the Tories, America and Israel one week. Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky.

Summer solstice is the longest day of the year and is the official start of summer It always takes place from June 20 to June 22 in the northern half of the year.In 2018 it takes place on Thursday, June 21. Summer solstice this year will end on September 23 at which point the autumn equinox begins. In the UK, the summer solstice centres around Stonehenge, which was built between 3,000 and 1,600 BC, where pagans thousands of years ago marked the day.Crucially the rising sun only reaches the centre of the ancient stone circle on one day of each year. Crowds of devotees, often dressed for the occasion, regularly converge to watch the moment the sun rises above the Heel Stone.It’s just one of the many pagan festivals. Others include midwinter and imbolc – the day that traditionally marks the start of spring. In many cases, the rituals are linked with themes of religion or fertility.This is because the day falls halfway between the start of the planting and harvesting seasons. Wianki celebrations in Poland are similar to those held in Britain, as the day is largely considered a pagan religious event.There are different traditions across Europe, with Estonia using the day to mark a shift in planting or cattle rearing.In Russia and Ukraine, it’s tradition for revellers to jump over bonfires to test their bravery and religious faith."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000412814379.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"human rights brexit security deal","story":"Eurocrats said any treaty on tackling terror and cross-border crime would have a “guillotine clause” attached to our membership of the European Convention of Human Rights.Britain would also be automatically cut off from cooperation with the continue if it failed to implement any relevant judgement of the European Court of Human Rights.The move would effectively tie the UK to the Strasbourg-based court, which is independent of the EU, forever.It enraged Tory MPs, who accused the Commission of underhand negotiating tactics.Brexiteer Philip Davies told The Sun: “This is completely ridiculous and unconnected to security co-operation.“If the EU tell us we have to give votes to prisoners in order to co-operate on security then we should tell them to stick it.”Carl Gardner, a former lawyer for the Government, observed: “I’ve suspected for a while that Brexit might actually stop May from leaving the ECHR.”In a series of slides published yesterday EU officials also rebuffed Theresa May’s calls for a unique security arrangement.They said Britain could not have special access to the Europol police force or EU databases and would be treated like any third country.Eurocrats warned her hopes to keep current levels of cooperation would mean the UK had “the same rights but different constraints than Member States”.They concluded this presents an unacceptably an “integrity risk” to the bloc’s system of security cooperation and the Schengen passport less zone.And they slammed the Government for a lack of “clarity” on key issues including how a new dispute settlement mechanism would work.The slides said: “There is no presumption of mutual trust outside of the EU institutional framework underpinned by common principles.”However they only represent the views of the Commission and are not the agreed position of the Member States.Eurocrats delivered the ultimatum as planned momentum in the negotiations ahead of a crunch summit later this month failed to materialise.EU officials wanted this week’s round of talks to provide a breakthrough and had been hoping David Davis would attend.But instead there will be a few days of technical talks on the minutiae of our exit between civil servants.UK officials said June’s summit will act as a “stepping stone” to a crucial meeting in October when the final deal is meant to be signed.But an exasperated EU source admitted eurocrats had higher hopes for this week’s negotiations and bemoaned: “We are where we are.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Delays are all the more alarming, because more than ‘two billion euros (£1.75bn) have been spent on modernising controls since 2011.”Heavily unionised French air traffic controllers are currently striking regularly after joining a national public sector movement opposing President Emmanuel Macron’s employment reforms.Many are members of the USAC-CGT who said say they have to “resist the erosion of human rights,” said a spokesman.Air-traffic control in France handles more flights than any other country in Europe, because of the size of the country and its central geographical position.Carriers such as British Airways and Ryanair, the biggest budget airline in Europe, regularly have to make cancellations or delay flights because of the French.Under EU rules, passengers are not entitled to cash compensation if their journeys are ruined by strike action, although they may get accommodation and meals paid for."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004136276172.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chris chope never heard of upskirting","story":"It came as ministers confirmed a new law to make the practice illegal would be introduced following his intervention.Campaigners praised Government plans to ban the practice of secretly taking photos of underwear as a “great day” for all “right-thinking individuals”.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said Theresa May told Cabinet upskirting was “an invasion of privacy that leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed”.But senior Tories demanded changes to “arcane” Commons rules that allow MPs to block legislation with a single word.Officials said an upskirting Bill would mean perpetrators were “properly punished”.Victim and campaigner Gina Martin described it as “brilliant news”.She said: “I kept going because I didn’t want to brush it off again and say ‘this is just part of life.

I was presented as a hermit hiding out in Mexico but obviously that was a mistake and went wrong.I realised it was a serious mistake. Its hard to take it back.I spoke to them both and apologised. I realised it was a serious mistake but it was hard to take it back.

These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Over time, all of the branches will be rebranded Virgin Money.Another benefit is greater market shares in some product areas. Both banks offer mortgages and savings accounts but CYBG has no presence in investment products or in the credit card market, where Virgin Money does.Similarly, Virgin Money has no presence in providing banking services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) while CYBG does. The merger also creates a national business: at present CYBG has fewer than a dozen branches in England outside its Yorkshire heartland.Another benefit is that, with some \u0026#163425m worth of funding from Royal Bank of Scotland available to help increase competition in the small business banking market, the combined CYBG-Virgin Money will be in a stronger position to bid for some of that.   Cost savings will also be probably more than the \u0026#163120m stated by the bank.CYBG was at pains to play down these worries today, arguing it has already migrated two million Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank current accounts onto its new platform during the last three years, while insisting this would be a less complex integration than some other recent ones in the sector.Debbie Crosbie, CYBG\u0027s chief operating officer, pointed out that the migration would be phased over three years, rather than a \u0027big bang\u0027 as TSB attempted, which ought to minimise risks.She also noted that many of Virgin Money\u0027s 100,000 or so existing current account customers also currently have no access to digital banking in any case and highlighted recent big IT projects on which the bank had undertaken, not least its separation from National Australia Bank, its previous owner.She added: \"We are very alive to the challenge of managing execution risk.

Toddlers and babies younger than a year old are being kept in wire cages and forced to sleep on concrete floors in detention facilities while their parents are held in jail.  The family separations are the result of Donald Trump \u0027s \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 policy that arrests all adults who are caught trying to enter the US illegally, including those seeking asylum.   In harrowing audio, obtained by nonprofit ProPublica , children can be heard wailing for their parents while a Border Patrol agent taunts them.   The youngsters, described as Central American children separated from their parents last week, scream Mami and Pap\u0026aacute over and over again. The guard\u0027s voice then booms over the sound of their sobs: Well, we have an orchestra here. What’s missing is a conductor.  A total of 1,174 children have been taken away from their mothers and fathers in the US Border Patrol’s South Texas Rio Grande Valley sector. Many of the youngsters have been brought to the Central Processing Station in McAllen, Texas, since the policy was announced on May 7, Border Patrol sector chief Manuel Padilla told NBC. The immigration facility, known as Ursula, is now home to around 500 children separated from their families. Children of all ages, from toddlers to teenagers, are crammed into wire cages, up to 20 at a time, according to witnesses who visited the site.  An advocate who was allowed inside Ursula told how a teenage girl had been teaching other children how to change the nappies of the toddlers they are being held in a cage with. Michelle Brane, director of migrant rights at the Women’s Refugee Commission, said the 16-year-old had been taking care of a girl, believed to be two years old, for three days. She had to teach other kids in the cell to change her diaper, Brane told reporters.  She added that the child, who it later emerged was aged four and spoke no Spanish, only K’iche, a language indigenous to Guatemala, was eventually reunited with her aunt. Brane added: She was so traumatised that she wasn’t talking. She was just curled up in a little ball.  As anger over the scandal on Monday, the Trump administration defended its hardline immigration policy at the US-Mexico border. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, appointed by Trump, told reporters at a White House briefing that the administration was only strictly enforcing the law. This administration did not create a policy of separating families. ... What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law, she said. Trump administration officials say the zero-tolerance policy, which was not practiced by the two previous presidents, is needed to secure the border and deter illegal immigration.   President Trump said on Monday the United States would not be a migrant camp, as he blamed Democrats for not coming to the table to negotiate immigration legislation. The United States will not be a migrant camp, he said as he opened a meeting of the National Space Council at the White House. And it will not be refugee-holding facility - it won\u0027t be.  But Democrats and some Republicans have admonished the administration for dividing nearly 2,000 children from their parents between mid-April and the end of May. Medical professionals have said the practice could cause lasting trauma to children. “The increasing number of children being ripped away from their parents is sickening, said Democratic Senator Michael Bennet. Yet the president and his administration continue to perpetuate falsehoods and blame others for their own cruelty.  Democratic lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, visited detention centres on Monday. After touring facility in San Diego, Pelosi said: Our message to Mr. Trump is, stop this inhumane, barbaric policy. This is not an immigration issue this is a humanitarian issue. She added: But the president says \u0027it\u0027s not my fault I didn\u0027t do it,\u0027 no you did do it. You did it to the Dreamers and now you\u0027re doing to the children. You can rescind this action in a moment, said Pelosi.  Pelosi also called on Nielsen to resign from her post over the dispute. Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee told reporters: Today I saw a little nine-month-old and a one-year-old, obviously babies who had been separated. So the question is as I yield, what are we here to do to be solution and problem solvers? We could right now, or we would right now or we would right now or we are saying to the president right now to stop this zero tolerance and the child abuse of this children.  Trump has sought to use the widespread outrage over the family separations to push through other immigration priorities that have stalled in Congress, such as funding for his long-promised wall along the Mexican border. He has blamed Democrats for the impasse, even though his fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress. Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who ran unsuccessfully against Trump in 2016 for their party\u0027s presidential nomination, said he would introduce legislation this week to halt family separations. All Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers. This must stop. Now. We can end this crisis by passing the legislation I am introducing, the Texas lawmaker said.  He said his bill would build temporary shelters where immigrant families could stay together in cases where there was no threat to the children\u0027s safety, double the number of federal immigration judges and speed handling of asylum applications. The House was set to vote on Thursday on two Republican immigration bills, both drafted without input from Democrats.

And he claimed the so-called Brexit dividend - which the Institute for Fiscal Studies this declared to be a myth - will be worth \u0026pound135 billion a year by 2025. Taking questions after a speech on Brexit at the Speaker\u0027s House in the Palace of Westminster he said the Government had given Dominic Grieve everything he asked for. He continued: But it has not given Lord Hailsham everything he asked for. Lord Hailsham wants a motion that will stop Brexit, Dominic Grieve has said quite clearly that he does not want to stop Brexit but he wants parliamentary accountability. An unamendable motion is parliamentary accountability. An amendable motion could be used to stop Brexit. So I think Dominic has already won, it is only Lord Hailsham who hasn\u0027t won, and I think Lord Hailsham mustn\u0027t be allowed to win.  Britain could receive a post-Brexit dividend of \u0026pound135 billion five years after Brexit, Mr Rees-Mogg added. He reiterated the claim while discussing sanctions on US products Britain was obliged to support while a member of the EU. He cited Professor Patrick Minford, the head of the Economists for Free Trade (EFT) group, which came up with the figure in a report last November. The MP said on Monday that being free of EU trade rules would mean our opportunities are going to be much greater and we will be able to deal with other nations.

This is Kim\u0027s third trip to China this year, coming less than a week after he met Trump in Singapore for historic talks. Following the Singapore summit, Trump agree to work with Kim toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, committed to provide the North\u0027s regime with security guarantees and pledged to end war games, which Pyongyang and Beijing have long seen as provocative.  In an unusual move, Chinese state media announced Kim\u0027s visit and said he would stay for two days. Previously China would only confirm Kim had visited after he had left the country. No other details were provided. A Kim trip to China to discuss his summit with Trump had been widely anticipated in diplomatic circles.

The boy, who appears to be in his mid teens, was filmed shouting You all right, Manu? at the visibly irritated politician. The embarrassing encounter took place as the 40-year-old head of state took part in a solemn ceremony commemorating his country’s call to arms during the Second World War. It contrasts sharply with a more relaxed approach taken by international politicians, including British prime ministers and American heads of state, who are regularly addressed by their first names, and even nicknames.  Mr Macron was shaking hands with a group of youngsters across a metal barrier when the teenager used the relaxed greeting, shortening Emmanuel to ‘Manu’. No, no, no, no, no,’ Mr Macron replied. ‘You’re there, you’re at an official ceremony, you conduct yourself in the proper way. You can play the idiot, but today it’s all about the Marseillaise [the National Anthem] and the Song of the Partisans [A song about the French Resistance]  You call me the President of the Republic, or Sir. The unidentified student immediately replies Yes, Sir’, to which Mr Macron says: There, that’s good. Mr Macron then said: And you all do everything in the right order. The day you want to revolt, you know first of all that you have a diploma and you know how to feed yourself, alright? And then it’s you who’ll be giving the lessons.  In 2006, the then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said: Lots of people call me Dave, my mum calls me David, my wife calls me Dave, I don’t really notice what people call me.   Heads of state such as American president Donald Trump are also known for referring to themselves by their first name. The Macron incident took place on Monday at Mont Valerien, a fortress in the Paris suburbs used by the Nazis as a prison and execution site during the wartime occupation of the French capital. It is now a national memorial to the French Resistance after being consecrated by General Charles de Gaulle in 1945. It was De Gaulle who, on June 18 1940, made his famous Appeal speech from London, calling on the French people to rise up against the Germans.

More people on Personal Independence Payment (PIP) will be able to wait 10 years before they are re-assessed, officials pledged. And when that re-assessment does come, it will be a \u0027light touch\u0027 review, the government said. Ministers made the decision after bowing to pressure from charities. Those charities welcomed the shake-up for PIP claimants, some of whom have to suffer reassessment every year, as a victory for common sense. But they also warned today\u0027s announcement is not enough - because it will by no means apply to all PIP claimants.  Campaigners warned more must be done to stop people facing the needless and stressful re-tests for their benefits. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has also been unable to say how many people will benefit from the change - because the policy is not finished yet. Detailed guidance will only be issued to staff later this summer. DWP guidance so far claims the 10-year policy will apply to people on the highest level of PIP, with severe or progressive conditions that will not improve. But DWP sources cautioned against coming up with a number of people affected because any help could vary from one case to another. Parkinson\u0027s UK estimated the shake-up will only help around half of people with Parkinson\u0027s who claim PIP. The charity\u0027s campaigning chief Laura Cockram branded today\u0027s announcement a piecemeal solution for a broken system.  She added: “The assessment process is simply not fit for purpose, and does not recognise the reality of living with long-term, progressive conditions. PIP can offer a vital lifeline however, people with Parkinson’s can find the assessment process humiliating and stressful, with assessor’s ignorance of Parkinson’s commonplace. “This is a step in the right direction but far more fundamental changes are needed. Simon Hopkins, chief executive of anti-poverty charity Turn2us, said: We welcome the news that the DWP has listened to the organisations and individuals raising this issue and are changing policy as a result. “However, this solution won’t fix all the issues we have seen with PIP. James Taylor, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at disability charity Scope, said: Today\u0027s announcement is a victory for common sense, but it still doesn\u0027t address the root of the problem with Personal Independence Payment (PIP).

Kat Lee, 32, was a just 18 when she started escorting after taking part in an adult photoshoot alongside her twin sister. During her 14 years of working in the adult industry, Kat built up a huge client list.  But now Kat, from south Manchester, has opted for a career change and started working as a barmaid as well as volunteering for charities, reports the Manchester Evening News .  Kat said: I worked (as an escort) from when I was 18 until I was in my 30s, I must have seen over a million clients.  “I was a teenager when I got into it. It started because of a photoshoot where me and my twin sister were asked to take off our tops and knickers for an adult magazine. “Later, the photographer said we would be good in adult movies, being twins, and that led to escorting. “I’m now working as a barmaid and volunteering for various charities because I love to help people. “It is weird because you’re working seven hours and you think ‘Oh my God, I could have worked one hour for \u0026pound140 instead of many hours work at \u0026pound7.’ “When you serve behind the bar and people say ‘have one for yourself’ you’re only allowed to take 20p off them whereas, when I was an escort they would buy me cars and holidays, not give me 20p tips. “I grew up in Sunderland and we were racially abused in school because my dad is Arabic, but the bullies later booked me as an escort, so I had the last laugh. “My clientele was mainly regulars in Manchester, people in the north west and businessmen stopping over at Manchester Airport.  Kat described how her usual working day often started early in the morning - seeing clients before they went to work. She said: “A typical day would start at 9am but I was never off the clock. People want mornings because they want to release themselves before they go to work. “You just don’t know when you’re going to be busy, but it’s usually dinnertime and after work at about 6pm, as well as Sundays at 3am. “I would put my clientele into two types. Some who wanted companionship, conversation and for me to be like a girlfriend - and others who would pull your hair and spit on you. So I tended not to wear much makeup because you keep having to put more on, and I tied my hair up in a bun. I would spend about an hour getting ready and showered a lot throughout the day. Kat said she experienced one frightening situation during her 14 years as an escort. She said: “I’ve only been in one dangerous situation on the job - when a client spiked my drink and took the money back after I was paid. I thought I was going to die. I couldn’t breathe or anything. I had a driver to get me to jobs and I wouldn’t have got home without him.  “I never caught diseases from clients, but I feel a lot safer in my bar job with CCTV. “I used to see four to five clients a day. You do get idiot clients who come in drunk. “One would see me when his wife had gone shopping. Another spoilt me with an Audi convertible and trips to Milan and Paris. I felt like Julia Roberts. “I never worked from home and always picked a hotel to meet the clients at. I worked at an agency for a bit but I didn’t have any power over whether I wanted to take a job or not. “If I turned down a client, the agency would fine me \u0026pound50, so I started to find my own clients. It meant I would be waiting in hotel bars for my next job and I would drink to gain confidence before seeing a client. “That led to public disorder offences and ending up in hospital to have my stomach pumped. “I found the work lonely as other women doing it would dislike me because men booked me more than them. While Kat does still work over webcam, she\u0027s unsure about returning to full escorting. “I still perform on webcam and stay in touch with regulars, but I’m not sure if I will ever return to escorting.

The worst example we found was a 50g bag of flatbread thin bites at Aldi. The pack reads: “What a treat – just 13 calories per serving.”  But this is per crisp rather than the whole bag, which contains 260 calories, 20 times more than one crisp.

Martyn James, of the consumer website Resolver, said: “Misleading people about the health benefits of their food isn’t just a betrayal of trust, it’s potentially damaging their health.” The British Retail Consortium said: “Retailers use front of pack labelling to ensure consumers can make informed decisions.” So, how much of these foods should you be eating?

Christian Nade, who used to play for SPL team Hearts, is accused of assaulting Laura Kennedy and subjecting her to domestic abuse while she mourned her grandmother\u0027s death.  The 28-year-old Kennedy told the court he also hit her with a boxed toy car she was due to give a child as a Christmas gift and assaulted her on a third occasion because she threw away a sauce he had made at the flat they shared in Renfrew, reports the Daily Record .  Laura, a skin specialist, rubbished claims she lashed out at Nade on each occasion after finding out he had been cheating on her and that he had actually been acting in self-defence to stop her from hitting him.  Nade, 33, who went on trial at Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, denies six charges relating to incidents between December last year and March. Laura, niece of Dumbarton assistant manager and former Rangers star Ian Durrant, told the court that Nade first struck her on December 5 after a row about a steak that had been in their fridge for so long it was going green. The blonde mum, who said she was 5ft 7in and weighs 9st, explained: “I went to the police about Christian lifting his hands to me – I wanted to report it. “I remember it was the start of December because my gran had just passed away. “The first time was because I had thrown out food from the fridge and because I never apologised, he hit me. “There was an out-of-date steak in the fridge and I threw it out. “He hit me in the face with the back of his hand. It was the right side of my face – it was my cheek and my ear. “I had a red mark on my face.” "},{"url":null,"title":"half primary school teachers give","story":"NewsHalf of primary school teachers give out soap to pupils from hard-up householdsAs budgets tighten, families are being forced to prioritise bills and food over hygiene essentials\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNada FarhoudMarie Lunn23:02, 18 JUN 2018NewsNearly 20% of parents said their child wears the same underwear for at least two days (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHalf of primary school teachers are giving out soap, washing powder and shampoo weekly to pupils from hard-up households, figures show.

In his first ever interview on Good Morning Britain this morning the retired lighting engineer revealed what the Duke of Sussex told him about Brexit and US President Donald Trump. Thomas Markle Snr was not able to walk his daughter down the aisle due to ill health and is yet to meet any of his daughter\u0027s new family. Mr Markle spoke of the moment the Duke of Sussex asked for permission to marry the then Ms Markle. He told the programme: Harry asked for her hand on the phone and I said: \u0027You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission\u0027.  The father of the Duchess of Sussex said he was not fazed by his daughter marrying into the monarchy. Meghan initially said she had a new boyfriend, before dropping hints about who he really was. Thomas said: “At that point she said it’s Harry and I said, ‘Harry... OK’. “She said we’ll have to call him ‘H’ so no one knows. “I eventually spoke to him and he was a very nice man, a gentleman - very likeable.” Thomas Markle told Good Morning Britain he had held phone calls with the Duke of Sussex, adding: He\u0027s great, he\u0027s an interesting guy. When asked how he felt about the former Suits star\u0027s nuptials, he said: My daughter has been a princess since the day she was born. He added: He made a good pick, didn\u0027t he. He also discussed conversations he\u0027s had with Prince Harry - who he is yet to meet face-to-face.  It\u0027s been over the phone, we\u0027ve had some interesting conversations on the phone. He\u0027s a smart guy. He\u0027s an interesting guy. I was complaining I didn\u0027t like Donald Trump. He said give Donald Trump a chance, I sort of disagreed with that. The 73-year-old added: I think he was open to the experiment (of Brexit).  Mr Markle also spoke about the emotional moment he told his daughter he would not be able to walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle\u0027s St George\u0027s Chapel. Mr Markle told the programme: They were disappointed. Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said, \u0027Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you\u0027. On Charles walking his daughter down the aisle, he said: I was honoured, I can\u0027t think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles. I absolutely wanted to walk my daughter down the aisle, he added. I\u0027m recovering from a heart operation but I\u0027m doing much better, he told GMB.  Speaking of the controversy after allegedly being caught staging photographs with the paparazzi, Mr Markle said: \u0027\u0027I spoke to them both and I apologised. I realised it was a serious mistake. It\u0027s hard to take it back.\u0027\u0027 He said the staged snaps were not for money but to improve his image. I thought it would be a nice way of improving my look, but obviously that all went to hell. I feel bad about it, I apologised for it, it was a mistake.  Mr Markle said he watched the wedding from an apartment where he was recovering after leaving hospital. He said: She was beautiful. It was incredible watching her. I cried a little bit about it. I was very proud. I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me (walking her down the aisle) but the whole world was watching my daughter. I was very happy about that. The unfortunate thing for me now is I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle. That upsets me somewhat. He added: I\u0027ve never seen anything more beautiful than my daughter (on her wedding day), ever.

Louisa Jenson admitted fighting with Laura Gwin but maintained that she did not bite her. Last week she was cleared of unlawful wounding. The 27-year-old said that although she was found not guilty, the ordeal of being arrested and the process of going through a trial caused her to lose her job, miscarry the twins she was pregnant with and suffer post traumatic stress disorder. Speaking to the Liverpool Echo after the trial Louisa said that she had went to Miss Gwin\u0027s home in October last year to discuss ongoing issues between them.  Kevin Slack, prosecuting, told the court the women had fallen out over rent arrears owed by Miss Gwin to Jensen\u0027s aunt, and comments made about each other to parents at their children\u0027s school. On the day of the incident Laura Gwin text Miss Jensen\u0027s aunt saying: “The sorriest thing (Jensen) will ever do is thinking she is so big and clever. I will rip her f****** head off when I see her.” Miss Jensen said that as their children attend the same school she was concerned that something would kick off in front of the kids and other parents at the school gates. She said: I didn\u0027t want it to keep getting worse, I was hoping to sort things out but it escalated really quickly. Both women then got into a fight in Miss Gwin\u0027s front garden before being separated by Laura Gwin\u0027s boyfriend. Miss Gwin, 30, lost almost the entire fingernail portion of the index finger on her left hand, including bone, and was left covered in blood after the incident on October 11 last year. Louisa, from Kirkby, walked out of Liverpool Crown Court on Friday after being cleared of unlawful wounding without intent by a jury, but has since said the ordeal has ruined her life. She said: I don\u0027t deny going to her house but I did not mean for it to get physical. After the fight I went straight to the police station to report it, but they told me to come back in an hour because they were busy.

Mary Mellor, 25, has shown her incredible weight loss transformation after dropping from a size 20 to a 12 and is now using her experience to help others shed the pounds as a personal instructor. Exercise helped her beat depression and she is now set to wed her childhood sweetheart Martyn next year in the dress of her dreams. Mary told : I always struggled with my weight. I was a happy-go-lucky child until I lost my dad in 2004 when I started to comfort eat. Depression and anxiety kicked in when I was about 13 which got worse after I turned 17.  I used food to console myself and I started to gain weight. I\u0027d eat anything, particularly savory things like crisps and takeaways - lots of carbohydrates, fat and salt, she said. Mary gained 6 stone from the age of 17 to 23 which fuelled her anxiety and depression, trapping her in a nasty, intractable loop of negative emotion and hopelessness. Depression just creeps up on you and you don\u0027t even notice until you\u0027re at rock bottom. It\u0027s horrible and vile. I stopped wanting to go out or socialise with people. I didn’t want anyone to see me the way I was. I was stuck in my own bubble and I was too scared to go to the shops on my own. I thought everyone was staring at me and judging me because I was an overweight young mum. I was always sad and just wanted to be left alone. I knew there had to be more to life.  Then one day while her new baby Bobby, now 2, was asleep in his moses basket and her other son Tyler, now 5, was out at nursery school, Mary sat down on the couch eating biscuits watching soaps when her breathing became laboured. I felt so uncomfortable. Breathing was hard and I just felt so heavy. I have asthma and excess weight makes that worse. I was using my inhaler more and more and I was struggling to breathe. I knew I had to do something. I had just had my second child and I did not want to be the mum who couldn\u0027t play with them. So just eight weeks after Bobby\u0027s birth she decided to start exercising. I joined a circuit training course in Elite Fitness in Langton. I was really nervous but I asked a friend to come with me so I could not back out.  The first session was horrible. I thought I was going to die. At the end of the class I felt really good but it also made me realise how unfit I was. I had tried exercise before but I always got bored. But with circuit training you keep moving from one thing to another so it stays interesting. And exercise clears your head. It makes you feel you\u0027ve really achieved something for the day. I started to go to classes every Tuesday night and Sunday morning and I saw my weight start to drop off straight away.  Then I did a bootcamp where I went to three to four classes every week for two months. I lost 2st and I made friends for life with people from the class. They taught us about nutrition - advising us to cut out rubbish and fizzy pop and to eat vegetables and protein instead.  Before I ate everything the kids were having like chips and chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes and sausages or sandwiches.  But now I have omelettes for breakfast, for lunch I have a salad or freshly cooked stir-fry and for dinner I have chicken salad or turkey mince and vegetables.  Just changing your diet and exercising makes such a huge difference and I\u0027ve realised that if you pre-prepare your meals when you\u0027re hungry you can have healthy food quickly instead of grabbing an unhealthy snack. Mary, from Stoke-on-Trent, is to wed her childhood sweetheart Martyn next year. He is her brother\u0027s best friend and the pair have known each other since she was 13. I have 13 bridesmaids but I only brought my mum and sister shopping for the dress. I want it to be a surprise. I just bought it two months ago and I couldn\u0027t be happier. It\u0027s the dress of my dreams, only better, she said.  Mary\u0027s life really turned full circle two weeks ago when she was invited to teach the same beginners class she started just 18 months earlier with her first teacher who helped inspire her love of exercise. I was nervous being on the other side at the start but it was really good fun. There were 15 students - most of them were friends who had come to support me and I loved it. Now I\u0027m training for my level three so I can take one-on-one classes. I\u0027m studying nutrition, anatomy and the gym environment in my spare time and life is good. Depression was horrible. I never want to go back there. It was not an easy journey but I feel really good now and I want to use my experience to help other people feel good too, Mary said.  I can\u0027t explain how different life is now. Before I was anxious or depressed 90% of the time but that has dropped to 5% which is pretty healthy. Even clothes shopping is enjoyable now. I don\u0027t feel trapped anymore and I know that the world is my oyster. I still want to lose more weight but I\u0027m not built to be a size zero. I\u0027m 5\u00279 and I\u0027ve dropped from a size 20 to a 12. I\u0027m looking forward to our wedding, to the future and to helping others. I know how hard it is to lose weight and now I want to help other people feel better too.  Mary will take new clients through her Facebook and Instagram pages later this year.

Emmanuel Olubayo could only watch helplessly as Emma, a nursing team leader, collapsed from an undetected heart defect and died in the home they shared in Leicestershire. Paramedics tried for an hour to resuscitate the 41-year-old before performing a rare posthumous delivery.  They carried out an emergency Caesarean section on the living room floor last November, Leicestershire Live reports.  The couple\u0027s baby girl Aretha was delivered alive then taken to hospital.  Emmanuel said he was shocked to become a father and a widower on the same day. The 35-year-old education consultant said: “It is hard and I don’t really know how I am coping as single dad but I am. “I have to be strong for Aretha. One day I will tell her all about her mother and how wonderful she was.” He said he believed his wife of eight months, whose heart suddenly stopped, had battled on to give their daughter Aretha the chance to live. Aretha was born 10 weeks prematurely and was taken to hospital where she was cared for by members of the team that Emma led – the critical care outreach team which covers Glenfield Hospital, Leicester Royal Infirmary and Leicester General Hospital.  Emmanuel, who was living in Birmingham, told how he and Emma fell in love after meeting in an internet dating chat room. “I knew when I started chatting to Emma online that she was special, he said. We had an immediate connection. “We got on really well and arranged to meet after three weeks chatting.” The pair had their first date at the Parcel Yard pub in Leicester in May 2016.  Emmanuel said: “I caught a train after work and we met at about 7pm. “We did not want the night to end and I caught the last train home to Birmingham. “The evening had flown by and we talked about everything and nothing. “We could not wait to see each other and were in contact all the time from that night on. “it was as if we were meant to be together.” The romance blossomed as Emma travelled to Birmingham and Emmanuel came to Leicester to see each other. In December 2016 – seven months after they first chatted online – Emmanuel popped the question. “We were out for meal in Birmingham when I got down on one knee in the restaurant, he said. “I gave Emma a sapphire ring and asked her to marry me. “She said yes and was ecstatic. Everyone cheered. It was beautiful.” The pair married in Birmingham in April 2017.  Within a month Emma was pregnant. Emmanuel said: “We were both delighted that we were pregnant so quickly. “Everything was going so well. It was great and we were making plans for the future. We wanted a couple of children. “We did not want to know what sex the baby was. We wanted it to be a surprise. “It was fun choosing names for a boy and for a girl.” Aretha was taken to hospital and was finally allowed home a month before her due date.  More than 650 people attended Emma’s funeral and friends have set up an online fund-raising page for Emmanuel and Aretha.  Clair Ripley, who set up the fund, said online: “Emma was a highly regarded nurse at University Hospitals of Leicester and was the driving force behind the Critical Care Outreach and Sepsis Teams. “Some of you may be aware and some of you may not, but unfortunately on November 26 2017, Emma suddenly passed away. “She was so very loved as a wife, daughter, sister, auntie, friend and colleague.

Jennifer Katherine was out enjoying a ride and did not realise she had ridden into the Windsor Triathlon route until bikes began whizzing by her at around 9am yesterday. Her headcam shows the moment a cyclist appears to try to undertake her and allegedly clips the animal with Jennifer still in the saddle. Jennifer can be heard screaming \u0027oh my f***ing God\u0027 in fear as she tries to regain control of her horse. Meanwhile, the cyclist races on and does not stop to see if she or the animal are OK, appearing to turn and give what Jennifer claims to be the \u0027middle finger\u0027 to her.  Race organisers Human Race Events have confirmed they are reviewing the video and are investigating in a bid to track down the cyclist - claiming anyone at fault will be \u0027disqualified\u0027. Jennifer, from Windsor, Berkshire, said: Nobody stopped and the cyclist that hit me seemed to show no remorse by what looks like him lifting his middle finger at me whilst riding off as I screamed. Although one cyclist hit me, I am surprised there wasn\u0027t more. Many individuals on this stretch of road at this time had passed dangerously and irresponsibly - too fast and too close. They also put other road users at risk by putting themselves between my horse and oncoming vehicles. It was terrifying being on a spooked horse and knowing that these individuals weren\u0027t willing to stop. I am lucky to ride such a calm animal but there are other horses that really wouldn\u0027t have tolerated the speed and proximity of those cyclists, risking everyone. I am genuinely concerned. There are many amazing road users that pass safely - and who should always be thanked by horse riders - but there does seem to be a growing lack of awareness of how to pass horses safely on the road and indeed with other vulnerable road users such as cyclists.  I think that is what is more shocking in this instance as I felt victimised by many of the individuals on bicycles on that road at that time and particularly by the one individual that hit my horse and I. The incident left Jennifer in shock and she claimed to have an injury to her ankle while the horse lost one of its back shoes in the incident. Jennifer said she has reported the incident to the police, who she is due to meet with later. She claimed there was no event warning on the road. Jennifer said: I would not have been out on the road in any form had I known there was a sporting event on. I saw no signs alerting the locals that an event would take place on the road I was on and when, hence why I went out like any normal early Sunday morning this time of year. I\u0027m very thankful to the event officials for their prompt investigation into identifying the individual and the sincerity in which they are taking the incident. Human Race Events tweeted: We are currently investigating an incident at the Windsor Triathlon involving a group of cyclists and a horse rider. We are taking this very seriously. Riders will be identified and disqualified from all Human Race Events. All riders are briefed to follow the Highway Code. We do not condone dangerous cycling of any kind.

Dad-of-one Noel White, 28, was described as a beautiful man with the heart of gold by his heartbroken family and friends. He collapsed outside his home in Withington on Sunday but police believe he may have been attacked beforehand, reports the Manchester Evening News. Officers are investigating the possibility that Mr White was attacked at a car park just in the early hours on Saturday.  A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody for questioning. Paramedics fought to save Mr White, who collapsed outside his home in Heysham Avenue. He later died in hospital. On Sunday evening, a police officer stood guard as forensics teams trawled the house. Floral tributes and heartwarming letters to Mr White were left at the scene.  He was described by neighbours as a ‘nice lad’ who was well-liked. It is understood he was a talented singer and rapper, who had recorded a number of songs with other musicians. Further tributes to Mr White, who had the stage name ‘Whites’, were shared on Facebook. Close friend Anthony Wells said: “Noel had a heart of gold. He was a really good lad, he will be sorely missed.” Family friends Nikita, Jamielee and Mark Taylor shared a video of Mr White rapping on Facebook. “Noel was a beautiful young man inside and out,” they told the M.E.N.  “This has left a lot of people truly heartbroken. “He went out of his way for everybody and constantly had us laughing and smiling. He will be dearly missed.” Officers have appealed to anyone with information to come forward. Det Insp Wes Knights, from GMP’s Major Incident Team, said Mr White’s loved ones were ‘understandably beside themselves’. “We have now arrested a man on suspicion of the murder of Noel,” he added. “Our enquiries are continuing and we are still doing all that we can to establish the exact circumstances of his death. “There are still many unanswered questions in this investigation and we won’t stop until we answer all of them. Our thoughts are very much with Noel’s family at this difficult time. “I would urge anyone who may have seen Noel earlier that day, or may know his whereabouts in the lead-up to his death to get in touch with police as soon as possible.

You might have heard a few of the words on TV during the Olympics or Tour de France - but otherwise they\u0027re just used by those in the know. We\u0027ve teamed up with Halfords to lift the lid on some of the stranger examples you\u0027ve probably never heard of. To celebrate Bike Week, we\u0027ve also pulled together some of the best discounted bikes currently available at Halfords for men, women and kids. Cyclist lingo            Feed zone  This is where riders can grab their food and drink on the go in an event.  Bidon  French for \u0027water bottle\u0027 - the riders wouldn\u0027t get very far without these!  Domestique  Literally translated as \u0027servant\u0027, these are the team cyclists - and occasionally unsung heroes of big races - who do everything they can to try and keep their team leader in the race, including fetching food, water, and clothing. They even sacrifice their bike if their leader needs a replacement!  Peloton  French for \u0027group\u0027, the peloton is a pack of cyclists who ride together in close formation. This gives them added protection if they ride directly behind other cyclists, sheltering them from wind resistance.  Bonking  Another way of saying hitting the wall, bonking is when a cyclist completely runs out of energy, leading to feelings of nausea, dizziness and confusion. To minimise the chances of bonking, riders require proper hydration and nutrition during each stage of the ride.  Musette  These are cotton bags which are handed out to riders during the feed zones in races. They contain food, energy bars, and drinks to maintain energy levels and keep the bonk at bay.   Directeur sportif  Similar to a team manager, the directeur sportif is usually a former pro cyclist who manages a team and rides in the team car. They decide team tactics and strategies throughout races.  Autobus  You don\u0027t really want to be in the \u0027autobus\u0027 - aka the \u0027grupetto\u0027 - because it\u0027s the word used to describe cyclists who are struggling going up hill. It mainly applies to those flagging at the back during the climb sections of big races, so you probably won\u0027t hear it much working your way up your local hill.  Lanterne rouge  Meaning \u0027red lantern\u0027 in French, the lanterne rouge is the last cyclist to cross the finish line during the Tour de France, which takes place in a few weeks time. The term comes from the red light which used to be attached to the rear end of a train, which meant the driver could easily check the train carriages were still coupled properly at the rear.  Soigneur   Pronounced \u0027swan-yer\u0027, these guys and girls are the non-cycling equivalents of domestiques , responsible for washing the clothes at the end of each day, providing food, drink and massages to the cyclists - as well as making sure everyone gets to the hotel for a good night\u0027s kip!

Sophie Turner, 19, put the names of the victims on social media and accused them of lying about the assaults in order to gain compensation. Ms Turner is the first person to be convicted in Merseyside of naming such victims, reports the Liverpool Echo.  The judge said that she had taken away the protection given to them by the law and sentenced her to 18 weeks. Her trial at Liverpool Magistrates\u0027 Court followed the jailing of two drug dealers who had plied two young girls with alcohol and cocaine before engaging in sexual activity with them.  They also filmed the attack and encouraged the girls, aged 14 and 16, to engage in sexual activity with each other. One of the men was Turner’s brother Jamie, 26, and both he and his co-accused Myles Bell, 23, were jailed for 12 years last July. The magistrates court heard that around the time of their trial Sophie Turner of Davidson Road, Liverpool, posted messages on the Liverpool Echo website that were “likely to lead members of the public to identify” both victims. These messages were then posted to Facebook “using menacing and derogatory terms towards” them, describing the victims as “dirty little dogs who lie for compo” and “wrong \u0027uns”. The breach was reported to the police by both victims in the case and Turner was interviewed - but the court heard that despite that she continued her behaviour.  Turner denied she was responsible for the messages and claimed that anyone could have access to her devices and post the comments to her account. But District Judge Wendy Lloyd found Turner guilty of two offences of harassment without violence and two of publishing the names of the victims of a sexual offence. Sentencing Turner to 18 weeks detention the judge said that she had tried to “brazen” her way out of it in the trial despite overwhelming evidence. She had caused the victims, who had to give evidence twice at the mens’ trial, further suffering by her actions and “exposed their personal details in a public forum. She said: “They have been utterly exposed. You could not accept the wickedness of your brother and no doubt encouraged by your family and friends you made various posts.” District Judge Lloyd said that she had based them on “ill informed gossip….You were relentless, even on your return from the police station you posted in a similar vein again…..There was something of a campaign as you consistently responded.”  She described it as an unusual case of harassment and worse than normal cases, sayinng: “You took away from these two women the protection that the law had given to them and they were left open to be put forward to the court of public opinion. “They were already traumatised and you traumatised them further.” She imposed a life long restraining order not to contact the two victims. The court heard that the 1992 law relating to publishing identifying details of sex victims had not kept pace with new technology and the maximum penalty is a fine. She added: “It was designed for newspapers but is now superseded by the fact we publish from laptops and mobile phones. Pascal Jones, prosecuting, pointed out that the law was there to encourage people to come forward through anonymity and such offences “erode faith in the criminal justice system.” Permission to bring the unusual charges had to be obtained from the Attorney General. She added: “Not only was their right to anonymity ignored but their sexual history was on full display to see on Facebook.” In impact statements the victims told of their embarrassment and one said she felt “humiliated and violated” and after the original posts had been removed Turner posted more.

CCTV showed two boxes reportedly containing fragile porcelain and china items being carelessly tossed out of the van and bouncing down the stairs. But when the courier is caught out by the furious buyer Patrick Duffy, he starts carefully piling the packages at the top of the steps before carrying them down. The driver\u0027s employer Yodel says it has apologised to Patrick, 68, and has taken \u0027appropriate action\u0027 following the incident. Patrick, from Bradford in West Yorkshire, said: I\u0027d spent about \u0026pound450 on antiques from eBay. It was absolutely disgusting. I watched as he took the boxes out of the back and threw them down the flight of 12 stairs without any care.  They were china and porcelain ornaments and they are very fragile. I\u0027m a live-in caretaker for a block of flats and was working on a garden nearby when I saw the van pull up and the man start throwing the packages. I shouted at him and ran over to check the boxes at the bottom of the steps. I was worried that the antiques I\u0027d bought were going to be all smashed. I got the impression he knew straight away what he\u0027d done when I shouted him to stop. The only reason he stopped throwing them was because he saw me. He just said \u0027open them and if there\u0027s any damage I\u0027ll take them back.\u0027 I refused to let him take anything back and instead contacted Yodel myself. Patrick had been working in a nearby garden on the afternoon of June 12 when he saw the delivery van pull up. He was horrified when he saw his packages being thrown down the stairs and ran to check on them.  The caretaker had decided to rent a cabinet of his friend\u0027s antique store in Bingley, West Yorks, and feared his items could have been destroyed in seconds. One of the items, an antique coal shuttle that he had paid \u0026pound15 for and planned to refurbish, was shattered across the top. Patrick now fears some of the more expensive, irreplaceable items he orders could be damaged in the future. Patrick said: A friend of mine has opened an antique shop and I\u0027d decided to rent a cabinet from him to make some money. One thing was damaged but fortunately it wasn\u0027t one of the more expensive items I\u0027d bought, it could have been worse.

Bizarre footage shows the reckless man ruffling the big cat\u0027s mane as his grinning pal takes photos on his mobile phone in Tanzania\u0027s Serengetti National Park. The huge beast initially just turns to glare at the pair but he quickly changes mood and lets out a terrifying growl baring his giant fangs. One of the passengers in the vehicle can be heard yelping close the window as another rushes to slide the glass shut. The lion is seen glaring in through the window as the pair then cower away.  The footage was shared on Wildlife Sighting\u0027s YouTube page, titled: \u0027Dumbest Tourists Ever,\u0027 where scores of people slated the men for their actions. It is believed the lion - who was seen earlier in the video with a pride of female lions - was so close to to the 4x4 as it was seeking shade. Under the video it says: Lions in the open plains of the Mara and Serengeti occasionally use a vehicles shade as cover when there are no trees in sight, this doesn’t mean that they trust humans but only the vehicles. To try to touch is incredibly stupid and ignorant of the tourist that filmed the sighting.  South African safari ranger Naas Smit told The Sun : ”Only those who work in the wild know the speed of a lion and it could have torn the arm off the person touching it. “It would have the power to pull that tourist straight out of that window and kill them instantly in front of their friends. It was an incredibly stupid thing to do. “It could also just have easily crashed its way through the open window and torn into those inside. They were lucky to get away with it. They are wild animals. “If the lion had killed this person then game rangers would probably have had to have killed it and if it was the pride male it could have serious consequences.  “I just have to shake my head when I see people behaving like this and they deserve all they get” he said. The near-miss comes just a month after a a family was forced to flee a chasing pack of CHEETAHS when they left their car at a safari park. Dramatic video captured from the vehicle behind the family, believed to be from France, showed the big cats dashing towards the family at Beekse Bergen in the Netherlands. Seconds before the near horrifying encounter, a woman and whom appears to be a teenage boy were filmed leaving their black-coloured car to photograph cheetahs lying down in the park.

He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2780ce3cc0e-270x180.jpg ","title":"almost blue more dundee venues than ever to host gigs at city blues festival","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA record number of venues will take part in Dundee’s Almost Blue 2018 live music festival in just over a week’s time.Across the city, 31 pubs and venues have signed up for this year’s festival over the weekend of June 29-30 and July 1, beating 2017’s previous record of 26.This year, for the first time, venues will take part in the West End and Hilltown, along with a raft of other pubs new to the festival.Organisers say the increase shows the snowballing popularity of Almost Blue – formed in 2012 with only two venues – has grown dramatically since the demise of the former Dundee Blues Bonanza five years ago.Among the new venues taking part for the first time are the Q Bar at the Queens Hotel on Nethergate, Cookies on Hilltown and the Campbeltown Bar on Hawkhill.

It’s a phrase to alert the teachers.”The father-of-two believes the needles fell out of wheelie bin which was lying on its side next to the paraphernalia.He spoke to his children, daughter Kiyann, 12, and Kelvin, to warn them about the needles and waited for council staff to come and safely dispose of them.Graeme, who works for Scotmid, said: “I think one of the bins had blown over, and there were about 30-odd needles lying on the ground. Children were coming out of school around 4pm, and there are three schools near here so a few kids walk past.\u0026#8220I waited and told any children coming past to go on to the pavement on the other side, as the needles were also on the road itself.”Gregor Murray, the council’s education convener, said: “The children were involved in an environmental project to clean-up the area around the school.“The ‘cookies and cream’ phrase was something they were told to shout out if they found anything like needles, broken glass or other hazardous things. I welcome anything like this schools are doing to make the children safe.”David Baxter, Dundee branch secretary of teaching union the Education Institute of Scotland, welcomed the procedure, saying: “The teachers’ objective is to keep children safe and I think, in Dundee, they do a really good job of that.

Tour companies are bringing people in, they’re spending time here, exploring the area, and that’s only getting better.“People visiting Scotland used to stay in Edinburgh then go for a bit of golf in St Andrews or Carnoustie and then head back to the capital. Now they can stay here.“There are discussions ongoing with three major companies with regards to bus tours.”It’s one of several initiatives being developed to further shape Dundee’s new identity as a cultural tourism destination, following widespread recognition in the media., Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Lonely Planet have all included it in lists of must-visit cities across the world.Several cruise ships have docked in Dundee this year, bringing with them a haul of foreign tourists keen to get their selfie with Desperate Dan in City Square.However, city promotion boss Jennifer Caswell has told the Tele her focus is now on making Dundee a city break hotspot, rather than just a day-tripper destination.To that end, she and other city bosses revisited the city’s tourism strategy in May for the years ahead, to ensure they’re well-prepared for the influx of people keen to see the city during The Open next month and, from September, when the V\u0026ampA Dundee finally opens its doors.She said: “We want Dundee to be the best version of itself that it can be.“Following last month’s meeting we’re where we want to be. We’re bang on target. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is fantastic – but it’s just the beginning.”Among the ideas being considered is Dundee having ‘world hosts’ – ambassadors for the city, for which Ms Short has undergone training – and ‘Dundee concierges’, local workers who can give visitors the inside track on the best attractions to see, as well as great places to eat.Along with making Dundee more attractive to foreign tourists, Ms Caswell said she wanted people from elsewhere in the UK to come to Dundee – just as we flock to cities like Newcastle and Liverpool.She said: “We’re hearing more and more all the time when we speak to people from elsewhere that they want to come and see what Dundee is all about now – they want to know more.“We just have to make sure we can provide for them.”Investment is key to the city’s growth, including its ever-expanding directory of hotels. Sleeperz opens next month at the new train station, with Hotel Indigo shortly to follow.Projects such as those, and others all over the city, form the “spokes” around the “hub” of the V\u0026ampA, which has served as a driver to bring cash in.Ms Caswell added: “We have seen an ever-increasing number of new ventures develop in the city to service the increase in current visitors to this area.“The expected rise due to the V\u0026ampA Dundee means this is likely to increase in pace over the next few months. Being seen as a top destination in Europe to visit helps establish our reputation across the board.“We are now on the world map as a city destination, be that for visiting, working or investing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee defender jon aurtenetxe linked with move to leeds united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee full-back Jon Aurtenetxe has been linked with a surprise move to Championship side Leeds United.The troubled English giants recently appointed former Chile and Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa as their new manager.The 26-year-old left-back enjoyed the best spell of his career under the enigmatic Argentine, known as ‘the Madman’, at Athletic Bilbao, reaching the final of the Europa League in 2012.Aurtenetxe left Dundee after a season at Dens Park.

last season to top the table but fell well short of champions St Mirren.This time around, it promises to be even more difficult with two teams coming down from the Premiership.Starting with those two,

Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another

Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspONCE-in-a-lifetime plans to transform eyesore buildings in the heart of Inverness into a major attraction will take several years to come to fruition, with discussions yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 8:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116168.jpg","title":"Could this be Nessie lurking in the deep","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness man on a dreich day beside Loch Ness popped off a couple of shots on his camera before swiftly retreating to the shelter of his parents\u0026rsquo car.It was only later back home in Milton of Leys when he was reviewing his photographs that Toby Christian began to wonder \"Have I captured the Loch Ness Monster?\"Two frames seemed to show a dark shape in the water, perhaps indicating something lurking just below the surface.The second shot in particular which is reproduced on this page with Toby\u0027 permission shows a dark patch on the water in the foreground which looks particularly mysterious.Toby (47), a keen amateur photographer, said: \"I was out in the car for the day with my parents Robert and Mary and we stopped just off the A82.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people seem happy with where we are going.\"As councillors, we need to be out there speaking to the community, and letting people know that they can come to us.\"Many strands of the plan are due to get under way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August.

Unfortunately, it is very small and it gets very over-crowded.\"The children and teachers deserve a place to meet modern-day learning needs while the outdoor facilities will benefit the whole community.\"I think everyone will be delighted.\"Dell McClurg, chairman of Merkinch Community Council, also welcomed the news but had reservations over the loss of some open space which will be

“To let” signs was spoiling the area.She said: “It’s hideous, it’s pulling the high street down.“People have no faith in the high street now because they just see signs everywhere.”According to Ms Muir, the number of empty shop fronts may also deter tourists.She said: “I wonder if tourists who drive through the town will keep driving because they think there’s no point in stopping since everything is empty?“It’s detrimental I think.”Another application was also made to convert a former hardware shop in the town’s Station Road into a shop and cafe, something that Ms Muir said may drag people out of the town centre.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b274b9fce828-847x564.jpg ","title":"six aberdeen food outlets ordered to clean up by inspectors1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBeetles and woodlice were discovered at an Aberdeen takeaway – one of six eateries urged to improve by inspectors.Aberdeen City Council sends food hygiene monitors to firms and groups that serve meals and snacks to assess cleanliness and food safety.Inspectors can award either a “pass” or a “requires improvement” rating.The Evening Express used Freedom of Information laws to ask the council for reports for outlets inspected since March where inspectors judged that improvement was required.One was De Ja Vu and Shakes N Screams, on Rose Street, which was inspected on March 5.The shops – part of one company – were warned they had a “pest problem”.The report said: “A significant number of dermestes beetles and woodlice were found in the back kitchen.“I am told that such are seen on a regular basis and for some time.“Dermestes beetles eat food debris, while woodlice eat rotting food and wood.“Considering the poor state of repair and cleaning within this room, it is not surprising [the premises] have a pest problem.“[The premises] are required to put in place procedures to control these pests.“I strongly suggest you employ a pest controller and carry out the cleaning and repair as stated above.“If you do not do so, this problem could develop into an infestation, at which point I will consider taking further action, which may include closure of your business.”Inspectors said 13 items were found damaged or in a poor state of repair and 10 areas were found dirty.The shop’s owner, Roy Duncan, said: “Immediately after the inspection, we called in a pest controller and that problem has now gone.“All the other problems have been addressed.“I have been running food businesses for 17 years and my standards have always been high.”Inspectors also visited Italian eatery Mi Amore, on Huntly Street, on March 7 and said a “deep clean” was needed, with mould and rusty equipment found.The report said: “A deep clean of the premises should be carried out covering all floor areas, walls, pieces of equipment and the ventilation canopy.“The dry goods store should not be used for the storage of food until the black mold is removed and the cupboard thoroughly cleaned and painted.“The microwave should not be used as it is badly rusted.”A Mi Amore spokesman said the issues had now been dealt with.“There were three concerns raised during this inspection and we dealt with each of them straight away,” he said.“We cleaned the area the inspector had identified, we replaced the microwave and we cleaned the dry goods store.“The council inspector returned shortly afterwards and found no concerns, except for some minor problems related to a fridge, which we discussed.“We employ 14 staff and take food hygiene standards very seriously.“It is good the council does these inspections to raise concerns and we are always willing to put right what they find.“However, this is the first time we have had an inspection that has identified any issues.”Another venue visited by inspectors was the Fittie Bar, on Wellington Street, on March 13.The report said: “In the fridge there was a tub of skirlie, which was undated and I was told was made four days ago.“There was also an opened container of cheese slices, with the opening date being unknown.“Both items were voluntarily disposed of at the time of the inspection.“There were also two unlabelled tubs of food within the upright freezer and pies stored here were also unlabelled with best-before dates.”It added: “The sealant behind the sink to the right of the dishwasher is deteriorating, therefore making it difficult to keep clean. This should be repaired or replaced with a material which can be kept clean. The floor of the microwave was dirty.”A spokeswoman for Fittie Bar said: “Although I find the inspections rewarding and that it helps maintains the standard required, I do feel sometimes as a small premises some logic needs to be applied.“The building has been in existence since 1821 and every effort is made to keep the kitchen area modern and clean.“Even more of an effort is made to ensure the storage of food and its preparation is maintained with the highest importance.”Rishis Indian Aroma restaurant and takeaway, on George Street, was inspected on April 25.“During the visit, hand contact surfaces such as equipment handles (fridges, freezer, microwave), door handles, light switches, yellow gas hob control knobs, the microwave door handle and control panel, the sink and its surrounding surfaces and taps, and the paper dispenser were dirty,” said the report.A spokesman for the restaurant said: “We rectified all the issues raised right after the inspection and before a second inspection, which found no problems.”Monitors also looked at Chopstix, at the Trinity Centre, on March 1.Their report said: “Members of staff in the ground-floor servery area were witnessed to be not changing the disposable gloves as often as required, or not washing their hands.“The floor of the walk-in chill had spillages of mixed vegetables and other food spillages and requires to be cleaned.”The Evening Express contacted Chopstix. The company did not comment.Inspectors visited the four-star DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel on February 8, on Beach Boulevard, and noticed staff were putting best-before stickers on food items – then putting new ones over the top to extend their shelf life. Coconut cheesecake also had mold on it.A DoubleTree by Hilton spokesman said: “We expect to uphold the highest of standards when it comes to food preparation at our hotel.“We have been working closely to fully address the matters raised in the report.“As a result, we have adjusted our processes and conducted training sessions for our team members. The inspectors revisited us in March and have indicated they are satisfied with the measures we have taken.”When inspectors returned on March 27 they noticed a “significant improvement” but still required improvement, as potato was seen to be out of date.Inspectors also visited Aitkens Bakery, on Menzies Road, Torry, on March 5 and said in their report: “You must start recording the temperatures of food and of equipment critical to food safety.“Skirting boards, wall-to-floor junctions and a pipe running above the skirting boards are in need of a deep clean as they have a build-up of dirt.”The shop has since closed due to matters unconnected with the inspection.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"summer charity ball returns to north east","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA summer charity event will return to the north-east.The Summer Marquee Ball will be back for its 21st year, being held at Raemoir House near Banchory on Saturday.The ball has raised £330,000 for local causes since it began, including almost £70,000 for the Banchory Sports Village which is expected to open early next year.This year’s proceeds will go to cancer charity CLAN Cancer Support.Funds will be raised through the annual auction and raffle.This year, first prize is a week-long trip to Portugal, with second place a stay at the Marcliffe Hotel and Spa, and third a £250 voucher for Deeside Photographics.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"caledonian clean sweep as stuart secures the links title at first time of asking","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStuart Whyte admitted he was unaware of the prestigious recognition associated with the Aberdeen Links Championship \u0026#8230 until he was on the brink of being crowned champion at his first attempt.Caledonian member Stuart, 41, defeated Steve Jamieson, of Nigg Bay, by 2\u0026amp1 in the final at the Kings Links after only joining the Links club at the end of March.Stuart, who is originally from Inverallochy said: “It was only after my father Robert told me how highly the Aberdeen Links tournament is regarded that I realised how important it is.“The final was a great match of really high quality and carded five birdies ahead of the match finishing on the 17th.”Stuart, who spent the last five years in Spain, Dubai and Oman working in the oil industry, took a stranglehold on the match from the turn after he won four holes in a row.However, Steve battled back to win the 14th and 16th but Stuart’s strong burst at the midway point of the match saw him run out the 2\u0026amp1 winner.The trophy cabinet at the Caledonian will house all four Aberdeen Links trophies after Stewart Finnie won the seniors title for a third successive year, Dave Forbes lifted the Handicap Shield and Stuart Wemyss secured the Murray Cup.RESULTS:ABERDEEN LINKS CHAMPIONSHIP – Stuart Whyte (Caledonian) bt Steve Jamieson (Nigg Bay) 2 and 1.HANDICAP SHIELD – Dave Forbes (Caledonian) (7) bt Stuart Slessor (Northern) (4) 6 and 5.MURRAY CUP – Stuart Wemyss (Caledonian) (20) bt Michael Boyd (Bon Accord) (14) at 20th.SENIOR CHAMPIONSHIP139 Stewart Finnie (Caledonian) 71 68 (winner by three strokes). 142 Graham V Somers 72 70. 143 Steve Forsyth 70 73.144 George H Paterson 70 74. 146 David Mullen 71 75. 148 Ron Watson 73 75. 149 Graham McBeath 75 74. 151 Scott Spiers 79 72. 152 Roy Pirie 74 78. 153 George Reid 76 77, R A Fraser 75 78.158 James Muir 82 76. 159 Benny Lumsden 80 79. 160 Walter Rae 89 72. 161 Dave Fowler 81 80, Jim Skinner 80 81, Norman Stewart 78 83. 162 Thomas Bremer 82 80.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Lee Gifford’s Annabelle is recently widowed and sells all her material possessions for a cross-country tour with her husband’s ashes. Along the way she meets a gruff innkeeper played by The Late Late Show host Craig Ferguson, who could offer another chance for love.Locals to Argyll will spot The George Hotel as Lord Howard Awd’s (played by Craig Ferguson) Inn that Annabelle takes refuge in when she falls for the Scottish landscape. They may also spot Lochgilphead’s Argyll Street, which was packed with trucks on Wednesday June 13 for filming, and Icon Hairdressing which was the setting for another scene.To get into the mood for the movie, listen to Kathie Lee Gifford’s single \u0026#8216Love Me To Death\u0026#8217 which is now available on iTunes.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters week 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 16/06/18, 5:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe Now[Usual Science Matters logo]The battle for survival between native red and invasive grey squirrels has been ongoing in the UK ever since our ancestors introduced the grey species from North America in 1870s.With the species competing for resources and the greys carrying squirrel-pox virus, which is harmless to them but lethal to reds, the contest seemed to be tipped in the greys\u0026#8217 favour.But in nature such rivalry is likely to be influenced by more complex interactive networks than just two species. Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ban smoking outside cafes could","story":"NewsBan on smoking outside cafes could be ditchedSouth Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:10, 18 JUN 2018NewsNino and Karen Pajovic, owners of Cafe Le Monde, have received much public support (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA law banning smoking outside cafes could be binned within weeks. South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12698905.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/asr_ayp_060618Mhari5.jpg","title":"meet weeks wedding week","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Wedding of the WeekMhari Bryce, 27-year-old Reception Manager from Hamilton married 36-year-old Operations Manager Chris Rowe from Manchester.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie16:18, 13 JUN 2018NewsNewlyweds Mhari and Chris pose in front of a picturesque backdrop (Image: Adore photography)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeet this week’s Wedding of the Week couple.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"The most exciting chapter yet is about to open in Melrose","story":"TOP TV chefs, The Hairy Bikers will dish up the starter at this weekend\u0026rsquos Baillie Gifford Borders Book Festival in Melrose on Thursday.\nAnd it will be followed by a generous serving of explorer Sir Chris Bonington and his fascinating memoir Ascent, Charles Spencer talking to the Duke of Buccleuch about Charles II, and Great British Bake Off judge Prue Leith chatting about life and food.\nThousands of lovers of the written word will once again make their way to Harmony Gardens for the latest chapter in this fascinating and much-loved festival.\nOther highlights for 2018 include Robert Peston\u0026rsquos McInroy \u0026amp Wood Lecture on the state of the nation, Archie Macpherson recalling the glory years of Scottish football, Alexander McCall Smith celebrating 20 years of his bestselling No1 Ladies\u0026rsquo Detective Agency, King of Crime Ian Rankin talking all things Rebus, and Richard Holloway musing on mortality in his Waiting for the Last Bus.\nAlso on stage over the four days are award winning military historian Antony Beevor, TV presenter and archaeologist Neil Oliver, politicians William Hague and Gordon Brown, naturalist and conservationist John Lister-Kaye, gardening expert Carol Klein, journalists Stacey Dooley and Misha Glenny, leading palaeontologist Steve Brusatte, James Naughtie and Simon Jenkins on Brexit, Alan Taylor and Ian Rankin on Muriel Spark, Mark Millar, the man behind some of the biggest comic books and their film adaptations such as Kingsman and Wolverine, sporting heroes including ex-international rugby star Doddie Weir, marathon runner and Irongran Edwina Brocklesby, and record-breaking cyclist and adventurer Mark Beaumont, as well as comedian and ventriloquist Nina Conti.\nFestival Director Alistair Moffat is rightly excited by this year\u0027s line-up.

owners of The Allotment store, based across from the Bank of Scotland on the High Street, have managed to seal the deal with post bosses to restore a service.\nIt comes after a year and a half without a full-time offering.\nMr Douglas said: \u0026ldquoThis is tremendous news for the town.\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank Susan Meikle for stepping up to secure a permanent Post Office facility here

reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

Lowood Bridge has reopened ahead of schedule.\nThe B-listed 250 year old crossing, which links Galashiels and Melrose, was closed for 20 weeks between January 31 and June 15 for an essential and major repair and strengthening programme.\nDespite the early stages of the project taking place during the most extreme winter weather seen in recent years, the bridge reopened before the start of Melrose Festival Week.\nExtensive masonry repair works have taken place during this time which required significant scaffolding to be in place for a number of weeks, resurfacing of the road surface on and around the bridge has been carried out and the traffic light system upgraded.\nAll these works, which have been carried out by Borders contractors, also mean that Lowood Bridge\u0026rsquos 26 tonne weight limit has been removed, leaving all vehicles able to use the crossing.\nOver the first few days motorists are asked to drive carefully as they get used to travelling over the bridge once again.\nBus services which used the crossing before it closed will also return to using the B6374 road on Saturday, June 16.\nScottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar (Ind) said: \u0026ldquoWe firstly need to thank local residents, businesses and commuters for their patience during the closure of Lowood Bridge.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew this closure would cause disruption locally over an extended period of time but the project team and the local contractors have worked very hard to ensure the project finished ahead of schedule despite the heavy snow we had in February and March.\n\u0026ldquoThe Council is aware of the importance of Lowood Bridge which is why it carried out these works as part of a programme of bridge

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.

Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.

Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.

Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.

During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7936576.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Singing for England  Musician   s rallying call for Scotland to get behind their old rivals in World Cup","story":"              A SCOTTISH musician has issued a rallying call for his countrymen to get behind their old rivals in the World Cup.

The 53-year-old has gone on trial accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers and touching her bottom as they danced at her hen night in Atik nightclub in Edinburgh last June.  The woman, who cannot be identified, said she saw Leslie when they entered the club and recognised him from television, particularly Blue Peter.  Leslie is on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court under his real name John Stott and denies the charge.  The accuser was the first to give evidence and said she had spoken to Leslie during the night about football, some of his ex-girlfriends and speculation he could appear in TV programme Celebrity Big Brother.  While dancing with friends and a stag party later in the night she said Leslie approached her and said \"be careful, you\u0027re getting married\".  She said she thought he was being \"protective\" and suggested they dance together.  Leslie had a hand on her waist and she had a hand on his shoulder, the court heard.  The woman said: \"We\u0027d been going in circles then he pulled me closer.  \"I did feel uncomfortable but thought I was maybe reading too much into it.\"  She said she gave her friend \"a look\" to make her aware she was uncomfortable, adding: \"After that I felt his hand go down my trousers at the back.  \"I didn\u0027t know how to react. I made even more of a look to my friend because I knew I needed to be out of that situation.\"  She said Leslie touched her skin but was not sure if he had put his hand beneath her underwear.  The woman told the court a friend pulled her away and then danced briefly with her hen party to \"pretend it hadn\u0027t happened\".  She added: \"But then I got really upset so moved to the booth.\"  \"I asked my friend something like \u0027why did he think he could do that or what did I do to make him do that?\u0027\"  She went outside with a friend and her sister-in-law who said they should tell someone, the court heard.  She said they told a female bouncer and later a police officer at the nightclub who took her to a station to make a statement.  CCTV of the pair dancing in the busy club was played to the court and the woman said it could not be seen exactly when the alleged incident happened.  Asked by fiscal depute Fiona Nairn how she feels now, the woman said it had impacted on her relationship with her husband, friends and work.  She said: \"It\u0027s been one of the toughest years of my life when it should have been the happiest.\"  Under cross examination by defence lawyer Derek Ogg QC, she cried and said: \"I don\u0027t know why anyone would think I made this up. I have nothing to gain from it.\"  Mr Ogg put it to the woman the CCTV footage showed the dance with Leslie ended \"voluntarily\" rather than with a friend\u0027s intervention.  She said: \"That\u0027s not how I see it. I just wanted out of that situation.\"  It was also established that the woman was taken home by two police officers and given paper bags to place her clothing in with no forensic protocol in place.  Forensic scientist Sandra Coupar-White told the court she examined the woman\u0027s trousers, pants and tutu for potential DNA.  She said a mixed profile was found on the trouser waistband likely made up of touch DNA from the woman, Leslie and two other \"minor contributors\".  She told Ms Nairn that DNA could be passed indirectly from holding hands during by dancing but said direct contact with the inside of the waistband was more likely.

Critics of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) have argued it has reduced subject choice and ushered in a culture of red tape and bureaucracy.  But now officials from one of the world\u0027s best education systems are travelling to Scotland to learn about the benefits of CfE, which seeks to shift the focus away from exam cramming and develop wider skills such as problem-solving and group working.  Under a new partnership, seven schools from Espoo, the second largest city in Finland, are to be linked with seven schools in East Lothian with teachers and pupils given the opportunity to collaborate and share their expertise and experience.  International tables shows Finnish children perform extremely well in literacy, numeracy and science even though they start school at an older age and spend fewer hours a year in the classroom than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe.  However, the country is implementing a new national curriculum and wants to learn from the experiences of schools in Scotland.  The visit was brokered by the General Teaching Council for Scotland whose Chief Executive, Kenneth Muir is an expert on the Finnish education system.  He said: \"We are delighted to have been able to bring together schools in Scotland to partner with schools in Espoo which is part of the highest performing education area in Finland.  \"Usually the world looks to Finland for educational excellence, but here is an example of Finland looking to Scotland.  \"This confirms the high quality that exists in many Scottish schools and proves that we need to offer more positivity about our education system and the opportunities afforded children and young people here.\"  Eeva-Kaisa Ikonen, Espoo\u0027s superintendent of education, said Finish schools were looking to shift emphasis in the curriculum to create more of a focus on collaborative learning.  She said: \"We have been impressed with the Scottish school improvement and professional learning programmes as well as the practices for implementing CfE.  \"Espoo greets our new partnership with East Lothian schools and looks forward to shared learning experiences on these and other mutually significant themes.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, added: \"We are very proud of our schools in East Lothian and I\u0026rsquom delighted that our staff will have this fantastic opportunity to share expertise and collaborate with their counterparts from Espoo.  \"The fact that we have the opportunity to be involved in this partnership is a reflection of the quality of our schools, our hard work and determination of all in East Lothian to secure the best outcomes from our children.\"  John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, also welcomed the development.  \u0026ldquoIt is extremely welcome that the excellence within our schools in Scotland is being acknowledged by such a high performing and respected nation like Finland,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoI am especially pleased to hear of their interest in CfE the work currently going on to improve the life chances of all our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoI am sure this will be a useful and informative experience for all the schools involved and I look forward to finding out more about how the project is progressing.\"  In September last year a major critic of Scotland\u0026rsquos curriculum warned standards were being \u0026lsquodumbed down\u0026rsquo since its introduction in 2010.  Professor Lindsay Paterson, from Edinburgh University, said CfE lacked \u0026ldquoacademic rigour and could be \u0026ldquodisastrous for school pupils.  While recent international rankings caused concern placing Scotland as \u0026ldquoaverage more pupils are gaining Highers than ever before and the number of Scots getting to university is at record levels."},{"url":null,"title":"Comment   Let s wipe away the tears and rebuild our beloved Mack ","story":"              LIKE so many Glaswegians, on Friday night I found myself wiping away tears as fire engulfed the Mackintosh building at Glasgow School of Art for the second time in four years.  I have a strong and very personal and relationship with this wonderful, magical, beautiful building. Over the years I\u0026rsquove seen countless exhibitions at the Mack, done various evening classes, danced and laughed with friends. I\u0026rsquove stood quietly and been bowled over again and again by its sheer elegance and practicality.  And by Saturday the initial sadness I felt turned to anger. How for the love of God could this happen again? How could four years of painstaking research and restoration by hundreds of craftspeople, the rebuilding of the peerless library, the ambitious plan to give every first year student at GSA a chance to study in the Mack, to live and breath its inspiration, have gone up in smoke?  Who or what was responsible for starting the fire and why did it take and spread so quickly? Were there not procedures in place to prevent this inconceivably grim turn of events?  We must be rigorous and ruthless in uncovering answers to all these questions and more in the months to come. In the aftermath of the 2014 fire, such inquiries were overshadowed by the outpouring of goodwill around restoration. This will not be the case this time around, and nor should it be. The people of Glasgow, Scotland and beyond deserve answers, not least because we gave so willingly and generously of our money to fund the restoration that now lies in ruins in Renfrew Street.  Once the fire service has produced its report into the cause of the blaze, a full public inquiry may be the only way to establish where responsibility lies and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.  But another, even more difficult question will soon need attention: what now for the Mack? It is painfully early days, of course, and since we don\u0026rsquot yet know the exact extent of the damage, or how viable the shell of the building may or may not be, at present thinking about the future just makes your head hurt.  But since this building has always been a place of ideas, creativity and ingenuity, I\u0026rsquom trying my damnedest to focus on the positives.  Firstly, the building is not, as some are suggesting, \u0026ldquogone. I went to see what remains twice at the weekend and grim as the experience was, what struck me was the fact that the once beautiful west gable, arguably the finest architectural aspect in Scotland, is still recognisable, as is the iconic front elevation.  Secondly, thanks to an innovative project started after the first fire in 2014, the entire building has been digitised to within a millimetre of its life, both inside and out. In this respect at least The Mack still exists in its full glory, making the experience of the teams that worked on the now destroyed restoration invaluable rather than wasted. We should also remember that many of the surviving fixtures and fittings from the 2014 fire are still in storage.  It will be possible to rebuild the Mack from scratch if that\u0026rsquos what it takes. We should take heart from the Frauenkirche in Dresden, rebuilt after German reunification over 10 years starting in 1994 after it was completely destroyed during World War Two. The miracle rebirth of this beautiful church is now part of its story, something that makes it even more interesting to visitors. Think, too, of the chamber of the House of Commons, totally rebuilt after being razed on the final day of the Blitz in 1941.  The Mack arguably exceeds either of these two buildings in terms of architectural and cultural importance. Its place in the hearts and imaginations of Glaswegians, meanwhile, simply cannot be overstated.  Yes, the cost of rebuilding from scratch would be astronomical - quite possibly into the hundreds of millions - though maybe not as much as a football stadium. And yes, any such project would require a daunting amount of political and civic will to succeed and take many years to realise. But surely if any building deserves this sort of effort, the Mack does.  A build of this scale and ambition would be a heritage project unlike any other undertaken in Scotland, one that could ultimately provide employment and training opportunities for hundreds of people. There are pros as well as cons to be considered. But the biggest pro of all would be the continued existence of the Mack, both as a physical presence and an idea. A world without it would be an eminently poorer place, after all.  Let\u0026rsquos be honest, the original Mack was lost in 2014 what was being re-created and restored until last week was already something new. A complete rebuild would represent yet another, even bigger leap of faith. But it could be done.  Ultimately, it will be up to GSA to decide, and I expect to hear calls for a different future for the site, a less costly one that could be filled with deserving, long-suffering students more quickly. But I believe the people of this great city will galvanise and rebuild their beloved Mack once again if that is what is asked of them.

Ciaran Williamson, aged eight, was killed while playing with friends in Craigton Cemetery in Glasgow in May 2015.  A Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) found his death could have been avoided if safety precautions had been taken in the Glasgow cemetery where the gravestone stood.  The claim was settled out of court for a six-figure sum and will be split among a number of family members.  In a statement released via their lawyers Digby Brown Solicitors, Ciaran\u0027s family said: \"We are glad the final legal hurdle is over.  \"The last three years have been devastating for us - especially during the FAI and having to relive everything.  \"However we\u0027re grateful the civil action could be settled so quickly as it means we can start to piece ourselves back together.  \"We\u0027d like to say thank you to our friends, family, the local community and the media who have supported us emotionally and practically since Ciaran passed away.  \"And also to our lawyer Mark who helped us greatly through the process.\"  The FAI heard a group of five boys were playing a game involving climbing on to a large 1920s memorial, pushing off from the top to the perimeter wall and grabbing the branch of a tree to swing to the ground.  Ciaran had been standing at the base of the memorial, which weighed almost two-and-a-half tons, when it toppled.  Sheriff Linda Ruxton ruled the boy\u0027s death could have been prevented if the memorial had been subject to a routine inspection, and if a hole in the wall where the boys got in had been repaired.  Mark Gibson, partner at Digby Brown Solicitors, said: \"Ciaran\u0027s family have endured a very public agony and in ways very few people can relate to so first and foremost I\u0027d like to pay tribute to them for their courage throughout.  \"I can confirm a civil action against Glasgow City Council has now been settled which I hope means the family can start focusing on themselves again.\"  A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: \"We always aim to deal with claims as quickly and sensitively as possible.

The party wants David Davis to face MSPs on the Scottish Parliament\u0027s Europe Committee amid a row over the UK Government\u0027s handling of the EU Withdrawal Bill.  Mr Davis has been asked to give evidence to the committee on several occasions, but is yet to do so.  The SNP was left outraged last week when amendments to the legislation affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate in the House of Commons.  The Scottish Parliament had already voted against granting formal consent to the Bill.  The SNP said the move effectively turned \"on its head\" the Sewel convention, the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters, and called for Scottish Secretary David Mundell to resign.  The opposition to the legislation stems from concerns Holyrood\u0027s powers could be constrained as a result of the legislation, with some of the responsibilities returning from Brussels going to UK ministers instead of those in Edinburgh.  SNP MSP and Europe Committee member Mairi Gougeon said: \"The Tories are tearing up the devolution settlement before our eyes.

The PinkNews reception at the seat of Northern Ireland\u0027s suspended devolved parliament at Stormont will be held on June 28.  Campaigners said it was the first time a DUP leader had agreed to take part in such an occasion.  The country is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not available.  Change is strongly opposed by Democratic Unionists, who argue that civil partnerships are already available and believe marriage is between a man and a woman.  Benjamin Cohen, chief executive and editor-in-chief at PinkNews, said: \"The decision by Arlene Foster to attend the first PinkNews event in Belfast is an important step towards encouraging a dialogue in Northern Ireland and we\u0027re delighted that there will be a number of other senior cross-party representatives attending and speaking.\"  Political powersharing has been suspended in Northern Ireland for months, with Sinn Fein raising identity and rights issues such as same-sex marriage as key matters to be addressed in negotiations.

The government last week accepted the Commissioner\u0026rsquos report in full and agreed to overhaul its procedure to stop taking into account the identity of requesters.  Ahead of a Holyrood debate on transparency tomorrow, Labour will ask MSPs to back \u0026ldquoan independent review of both FoI handling and the recording of information from meetings.  MSP Rhoda Grant said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos damning report reveals repeated attempts by the SNP government to bury bad news.  \u0026ldquoNot only was the clearance process different, but there is some evidence that information was suppressed in answer to these journalists\u0026rsquo requests.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP has so far failed to recognise the seriousness of this unacceptable behaviour and properly take responsibility for it.  \u0026ldquoThat is why Scottish Labour is demanding a full investigation into the SNP\u0027s handling of FOI requests.  \u0026ldquoAnything less would only show that the SNP government simply cannot be trusted.

A legal battle is ongoing between the Action Group Company and Manx Capital, the investment vehicle and major claimant that took control of the mass legal claim and secured the settlement on behalf of the claimants..In his letter, Mr Clark said that investigations by a Sunday newspaper had raised serious questions about the credibility of the Action Group Company.He has joined parliamentary colleagues including Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP and co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking in calling for an inquiry.Mr Clark said: \u0026ldquoThis is an issue that was raised with me by a constituent that is directly affected by issues with the settlement agreed with RBS last summer.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoMany RBS shareholders believe that the rights issue undertaken by RBS in 2008 was promoted on a misleading basis.\u0026ldquoThey believe there were serious omissions of information which should have been brought to the attention of investors.\u0026ldquoThe RBS Shareholders Action Group Company was set up in 2009 purportedly to represent the interests of those investors.\u0026ldquoHowever, since the £200million settlement was agreed, a very small fraction of that sum has been paid out.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoThere are serious concerns about the Action Group Company and the lack of regulation in place to protect shareholders.\u0026ldquoI have now written to the Justice Secretary to join calls for an investigation into the RBS Shareholders Action Group Company, which should happen as a matter of urgency.

She was delighted someone wanted to hear her story.Befriending Caithness \u0026ndash part of Caithness Voluntary Group \u0026ndash now has groups in Wick, Thurso, Mey, Berriedale and Bettyhill. Mey is especially popular, with befriendees meeting from across the county every couple of months for soup and sandwiches, where there is a \u0026ldquoconstant buzz of chatter, like music. It\u0026rsquos lovely to hear, Angie said.The intergenerational group involves S5/S6 school pupils visiting hospitals and care homes. One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm. Tickets cost \u0026pound5 and this will go towards the July summer lunch.As well as being greatly appreciated by co-ordinators, the joy felt by the befriendees is evident. Co-ordinator Isobel Campbell shared a few, including \u0026ldquobefriending has saved my life, \u0026ldquohaving a befriender would be a luxury and \u0026ldquobefriending is a cup of kindness.One volunteer remarked: \u0026ldquoI just love a laugh and the banter.Befriending Caithness is looking for a volunteer marketing/social media intern.

All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster.

He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
