Britain\u0027s biggest ever...Holby City star John Michie\u0027s daughter is only person in the...Share this article\u0027Christopher Hampton\u0027s play is drawn from the testimony Pomsel gave when she finally broke her silence, shortly before she died, to a group of Austrian filmmakers, and from their documentary A German Life.\u0027Dame Maggie will be alone on stage for the entire production, directed by Jonathan Kent.She was last on stage in The Lady From Dubuque in 2007.       Brunhilde Pomsel worked Joseph Goebbels but denied any knowledge of what was going on in the Nazi party Born in 1911, Brunhilde Pomsel left school in 1926 and started an apprenticeship with a Jewish wholesale manufacturer.But as the Great Depression hit Germany - leading to the rise of the Nazis - she became unemployed, before getting a job as a shorthand secretary for Jewish insurance broker Dr Hugo Goldberg.Dr Goldberg, like many Jews, fled Germany after Hitler gained power in 1933 so Pomsel began working for author Wulf Bley, who was closely connected to the Nazi Party.She used these connections to get a job with the German Broadcasting Station radio channel and joined the Nazi party.Joseph Goebbels spent much of his time at the radio station making speeches, and offered her a job as his assistant.Thrilled to be working with the second most important person in the Third Reich, she jumped at the opportunity.But she insisted that she was not aware of the \u0027Final Solution\u0027 - the extermination of millions of Jews in death camps in Germany, Austria and German-occupied Poland - until after the war and said Goebbels \u0027must have kept correspondence about it away from her sight.\u0027She was inside the Fuhrer\u0027s bunker in Berlin in May 1945 when he shot himself as the Red Army closed in on his lair. After the war Pomsel was captured by Soviet troops and jailed for five years.Astonishingly, after being released from prison in 1950, she went back to working in broadcasting in democratic West Germany until her eventual retirement in 1971. She is not thought to have married or had children.    It was only in 2011 that she re-emerged, when a German newspaper published an interview with her and sparking a flurry of interest in the last surviving members of the Nazi leadership\u0027s inner circle. In a documentary Pomsel talked about her three years working for the man responsible for spreading Hitler\u0027s poisonous ideology in newspapers and across the airwaves.She said: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t see myself as being guilty. Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me.\u0027 Pomsel described in the film how she was told to keep the Nazi top brass supplied with alcohol \u0027in order to retain the numbness\u0027 and stave off the reality of their imminent defeat by the hated Russians.                                                       In 2011, Brunhilde Pomsel broke a 66-year vow of silence about the Nazi regime when she gave an interview to popular German newspaper Bild. Her revelations about the Nazi power circle\u0027s last moments shocked the world.She revealed that even after a lifetime of service, Goebbels barely acknowledged her: \u0027You couldn\u0027t get close to him,\u0027 she said. \u0027He never once asked me a personal question. Right up until the end I don\u0027t think he knew my name\u0027.Pomsel spent the last 10 days of the Third Reich in the cellars of the propaganda ministry as Russian artillery and American bombers flattened her surroundings.She continued to pump out orders from Goebbels until the very last minute - when Goebbels shot his wife then himself.Immediately before the murder-suicide, Goebbels and his wife killed their six young children by breaking cyanide vials into their mouth.Aides were ordered to pour petrol on the corpses of the dead generals - but the remains were only partially burned, and later found by the Red Army.On May 1 1945, shortly after \u0027The Boss\u0027 - Hitler - committed suicide, the Russians came into the bunker and \u0027dragged\u0027 Pomsel out.

In 2007, Holy Cross selected a site for a new campus in Gentilly. Holy Cross remains the only all boys Catholic school in the Greater New Orleans area to offer a comprehensive pre-K through 12th grade education.\u0027The school has a long history dating back to the 1800s when it was originally an orphanage. In 1837, the Congregation of Holy Cross was founded.\u0027The Congregation took its name from a district in the city of LeMans, France – Saint Croix or Holy Cross. In 1849, the Archbishop of New Orleans invited five brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross to New Orleans to assume responsibility for operating St. Mary\u0027s Orphanage. The city had been devastated by a series of epidemics: cholera, yellow fever, and malaria.\u0027In 1859, the congregation purchased Reynes Farm, a riverfront plantation. In 1879, as the need for the orphanage diminished, St. Isidore\u0027s College, a boarding and day school was opened. This became the original site on which Holy Cross School stood and it is here that Holy Cross\u0027 history officially began. The area has since become a Federal Historic District known as the \u0027Holy Cross District.\u0027\u0027The General Assembly of the state of Louisiana chartered the institution on June 20, 1890, empowering it to confer bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees. The original administration building was built for $15,000 in 1895. At the suggestion of the Archbishop, St. Isidore\u0027s College was renamed and solemnly dedicated as Holy Cross College.\u0027Two wings were added to the administration building in 1912 to accommodate the incoming students. Holy Cross operated a boarding program until 1972 that attracted as many as 150 student residents each year from across the South as well as from Central and South America.\u0027          The photographs were taken at Holy Cross School in New Orleans by an urban explorer Abandoned Southeast          Holy Cross was flooded by levee failures on the Industrial Canal due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005          A new campus was built in 2007 a new site in Gentilly and the old one damaged in Hurricane Katrina was left to rot          The red-brick exterior of the huge building hides the devastation inside after the storm hit the New Orleans region          Hurricane Katrina 80 per cent of the city buried under water and killed more than 1,500 people          130,000 people were displaced in the aftermath of the storm and buildings were left to rot          The school has a long history dating back to the 1800s when it was originally an orphanage          It was reopened as a boarding and day school as the need for the orphanage diminished          Abandoned Southeast says \u0027Holy Cross remains the only all boys Catholic school in the Greater New Orleans area to offer a comprehensive pre-K through 12th grade education\u0027Stunning aerial images of the road Jeremy Clarkson said was...A day they\u0027ll NEVER forget!

Yet despite their ripe old age, caravans are seeing something of a renaissance.‘Today’s caravans are a five-star experience,’ says holiday historian Andrew Jenkinson. ‘You can use them all the year round: modern tourers have full heating systems and double glazing. They are spacious, robust, ingeniously designed and incredibly comfortable. They have evolved.‘A few years ago, they tended to appeal mainly to older people who had fantastic memories of childhood holidays and had never lost the bug — or who wanted to rediscover it,’ says Andrew, author of caravan histories such as The CI Story. ‘But now lots of families are first-timers. Caravanning is enjoying a serious resurgence.’    Modern-day caravan: Yet despite their ripe old age, caravans are seeing something of a renaissance.

Just 234 of those have been delivered and the firm\u0027s original sales target was 700 planes. The A380, which is produced by Bristol-based Airbus UK, is made across Europe in Spain, France, Germany and Britain.The wings are made in the Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol, then shipped to Toulouse, France, where the planes are assembled. Landing and fuel systems for the A380 are also worked on at Filton.          The wings for the A380 are made in Broughton, Flintshire, in Wales.

A British Airways Airbus A380 aircraft on the runway at London´s Heathrow Airport Emirates cut its order of A380s from 162 to 123 aircraft following a \u0027review of its operations, and in light of developments in aircraft and engine technologies\u0027.Meanwhile, the UAE carrier is buying more of the smaller A330-900 and A350-900 aircraft, purchasing 40 and 30 respectively.The Emirates order for the A330-900 and A350-900 is worth 21.4 billion US dollars (£16.6 billion).A source close to Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for Airbus, said scrapping the  superjumbo jet is \u0027unlikely\u0027 to result in job losses, but would not rule it out.\u0027We assemble the engines in Derby but we make fewer than one-per-week,\u0027 they told City AM. \u0027In terms of the impact on jobs in the UK, it\u0027s a small programme and we can reallocate people to other engine programmes so it\u0027s unlikely there will be any.\u0027  Buzzing the pyramids, flying with the Red Arrows and the most glamorous cabins in the sky: The amazing story of the A380 told through incredible pictures By Jennifer Newton for MailOnlineThe A380 ushered in a new era of glamour at 38,000ft, with carriers using its cavernous interior to install suites, showers and bars.But now Airbus has sounded the death knell for this golden age of travel with the announcement, less than 12 years after its first commercial flight, that it will cease production of the superjumbo after 2021.Here we look back at the aircraft\u0027s remarkable history through fascinating pictures, from flying with the Red Arrows and buzzing the pyramids to peeks at the most luxurious cabins the aircraft offers.The early days of the A380          In 1994 Airbus announced it was to develop a very large double-decker airliner, called the A3XX, the previous name for the A380. Pictured is an early rendering by Airbus of the aircraft            Construction finally began in 2002. Pictured is a large section of fuselage being transported by road to the jetliner\u0027s final assembly plant in Toulouse, France          Parts for the A380 are produced across four European countries before being brought to Toulouse to be assembled. Pictured is a section of A380 being loaded on to a ship in Pauillac, France           A380 fuselage and wing sections are put on a freight ship ready to be shipped to Toulouse in October 2004           A barge carries an A380 central fuselage down a river in the French city of Bordeaux in April 2004, during the development and construction of the first superjumbos            A fuselage section for the A380 is moved to the double-deck jetliner\u0027s final assembly facility in Toulouse in October 2004 It was more than 30 years ago in 1988 when the idea for a super-sized 500-seat airliner was first mooted at Airbus. The aim? To directly challenge Boeing\u0027s extremely popular 747.By June 1994, Airbus announced it was to develop a very, very large double-decker airliner, called the A3XX.And six years later the $8.8billion (£6.8billion) project to develop the plane, renamed the A380, began in earnest.After the design of the huge new aircraft was finalised, construction finally began in 2002.          A section of fuselage is unloaded off a ship in Paulliac. A380 parts arrive by ship in Paulliac in France before being loaded on to barges to take them through Bordeaux to a dock at Langon and then by oversize road convoy to the assembly plant          A section of the first A380 fuselage arrives at the final assembly plant in Toulouse in January 2005, just months before the A380\u0027s maiden flight           Inside the Toulouse Airbus plant in January 2005, showing the first three A380s side by side as they are constructed            One of the construction milestones came in January 2005, when the first A380 Rolls-Royce engine was assembled            The first A380 passenger airliner is moved between hangars at the Airbus factory in Toulouse          Team effort: The forward and centre fuselages are made in France, the horizontal tail plane made in Spain and the tails fins and rear fuselages built in Germany          Workers gather in front of the nose cone of an Airbus A380 at the opening ceremony for the new final-assembly plant at Airbus\u0027s Toulouse factory in 2004. At that time, Airbus expected to sell more than 1,000 A380s. Total orders in the end totalled just over 320 The parts for the plane were built across Europe. The wings were constructed in Wales, the forward and centre fuselages made in France, the horizontal tail plane made in Spain and the tails fins and rear fuselages built in Germany.They were then brought by sea, air and road, to the production plant in Toulouse to be assembled. Roads around the plant had to be widened in order for the huge new plane parts to be transported in.The maiden flightAirbus finally unveiled the first five test A380s in Toulouse in 2005 and the first maiden flight took place on April 27 of that year.The giant plane touched down to applause after a flight of just under four hours. Nearly 30,000 spectators watched the behemoth take off and land.          In April 2005 the first A380 was moved from the assembly plant across a busy road to Airbus\u0027s flight test centre at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport           The A380 touches down in Toulouse after its maiden flight on April 27, 2005. The giant plane landed to applause after a flight of just under four hours    Airbus staff and media gather around the A380 after its maiden flight. During the first flight it recorded measurements for 150,000 separate parameters and beamed real-time data back to computers on the ground           The crew on the maiden flight took no chances - they donned parachutes and a handrail was installed inside the test plane leading from the cockpit to an escape door that could have been jettisoned had the pilots lost control. The plane was jointly captained by Claude Lelaie, Airbus\u0027 Senior Vice President Flight Division, and Chief Test Pilot and Vice President Jacques Rosay          Once testing of the aircraft was complete, the A380 went on a world tour. It first came to Britain in 2006 when it appeared at the Farnborough Airshow and flew alongside the RAF\u0027s Red Arrows           In March 2007, the A380 touched down on US soil for the first time, during its world tour. It is pictured landing at New York\u0027s JFK Airport             After landing at JFK, the world\u0027s largest passenger plane was honoured by the New York Fire Department, which sprayed water over the aircraft           While travelling around the US on a world tour, the A380 also made a pit stop in Washington DC. The aircraft is pictured flying across Capitol Hill and the Washington Monument           The A380 flies past the high rise buildings of Hong Kong during its world tour in 2007     The first customer to have an A380 delivered for service was Singapore Airlines.

It now has over 100 A380s in its fleet, making it the biggest customer.Following Singapore\u0027s lead, it created lavish cabins, with first class ticket holders given showers and private suites.Australian flag-carrier Qantas was third to take delivery of the A380 while British Airways received its first A380 in 2013. No US carrier has ever ordered an A380.Problems ariseDespite being launched to much fanfare and receiving orders from 13 different airlines, the A380 has been beset with issues.In November 2010, Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines temporarily suspended flights of the A380 after an engine failure forced an emergency landing in Singapore.          In November 2010, the Airbus A380 test aircraft flew a special flight over the Pyramids in Egypt following airport compatibility tests carried out at Cairo International Airport to confirm the airport was capable of handling A380 operations           British Airways received its first A380 in July 2013 and on its arrival at Heathrow, BA staff greeted it with Union flags. BA has 12 A380s in its fleet And by July, 2016 Airbus announced that it was cutting production of the A380 in half, going to just one jet a month by 2018.By 2018, Airbus said it would have no other choice but to halt the costly A380 programme if Dubai\u0027s Emirates airline, its biggest customer of the A380, did not place another order.Last year Emirates Airlines struck a $16 billion (£12.3 billion) deal to buy 36 A380s, but it is now switching some orders to the smaller A350.Analysts have pointed to customers demanding flights directly to their destination rather than following Airbus\u0027s model of taking a long haul journey from hub-to-hub followed by a short hop on a smaller plane.          The 100th A380 was bought by Malaysia Airlines and delivered in March 2013          A special celebration was held at the Airbus factory in November 2017 when the 100th A380 for Emirates was handed over       Engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce secures order to build 140 aircraft engines for Emirates | City A.M."},{"url":null,"title":"World Cup hero Gordon Banks missed knighthood officials lost nomination papers","story":"    Gordon Banks (pictured lifting the Jules Rimet in 1966) was considered for a knighthood but bungling officials lost his papers A friend of the late footballer told the Daily Mirror: \u0027The system may well have let Gordon down.\u0027It comes as Sir Philip Green keeps his title despite the fashion tycoon facing claims of racism and harassment.Prime Minister Theresa May has said \u0027steps should be taken\u0027 in Sir Philip\u0027s case as pressure builds for him to be stripped of his knighthood.\u0027I\u0027m glad he saved my header – it started a friendship I\u0027ll...Gordon Banks earned just £100-a-week, lost his eye in a car...Share this articleMr Banks lost his fight against cancer aged 81 this week and campaigners say that had the Government\u0027s Honours Committee not lost his papers, he wouldn\u0027t have missed out by dying before the upcoming Queen\u0027s birthday honours list.  Former Lord Mayor of Stoke Anthony Munday, 59, has been campaigning for the late Leicester star and said: \u0027It is frustrating and disappointing that the system may well have let Gordon down.\u0027          Gordon Banks (pictured) will never be knighted because the honour can\u0027t be given posthumouslyTerry Conroy, who used to play for Stoke, joined Munday to nominate Mr Banks for the honour three years ago.Mr Munday said that each year the honours came along and neither he nor Mr Conroy heard back.He claims that he then had political contacts investigate and was shocked when they reported forms had been \u0027mislaid\u0027.Mr Conroy, 72, said \u0027overtures\u0027 were made and he was told that the matter concerning his former teammate was being looked into. Caroline Tellwright, a Staffordshire farmer, also nominated the goalkeeper independent of the application submitted by Mr Conroy and Mr Munday.  She too was told that the 1966 squad legend was being considered again after both nominations were located.  On Saturday it was revealed that Mr Banks was in the running for a knighthood in June.Mr Conroy visited his old friend two weeks ago and said that he knew then his end was nearing and added there is \u0027no doubt\u0027 he should have been knighted. Ms Tellwright described the late goalkeeper as her \u0027hero\u0027 because of the charity work he carried out in his later years.  The Cabinet Office said it could not comment on the matter because \u0027the nomination process is confidential\u0027.Gordon Banks missed out on knighthood \u0027after Whitehall officials lost papers\u0027 - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Vegan activists perform rites ceremonies cattle abattoir","story":"    Vegan activists have begun performing \u0027last rites\u0027 ceremonies for incoming cows at an abattoir run by a major meat processing company.

The feted 44-year-old Japanese architect Junya Ishigami has been selected as the designer of the 19th annual pavilion project, and he promises to conjure one of the strangest forms the park has ever seen.The pavilion will be part rock face, part smog cloud, as if a landslide from an open-cast slate mine had been cut from a hillside and transported to the leafy royal park. Like a specimen in a natural history museum, the rocky slope will be held up on slender toothpick columns, forming a scaly canopy for visitors to explore beneath. Ishigami is clearly mindful of the perilous English summer: one image shows the structure in driving rain, with puddles and little streams snaking down its rugged surface. Like Francis Kéré’s 2017 pavilion, it could be one of the few designs where a natural waterfall intentionally adds to the attraction.‘‘My design for the pavilion plays with our perspectives of the built environment against the backdrop of a natural landscape,” says Ishigami, “emphasising a natural and organic feel as though it had grown out of the lawn, and resembling a hill made out of rocks. Possessing the weighty presence of slate roofs seen around the world, and simultaneously appearing so light it could blow away in the breeze, the cluster of scattered rock levitates, like a billowing piece of fabric.”Many architects talk of making their materials levitate and billow, but Ishigami actually does it. He has made a five-storey metal balloon float in a gallery in Tokyo, and produced a gravity-defying 10-metre long table of wafer-thin steel, with no visible means of support. At the Barbican in London, he installed a white frame that was so thin visitors could see it only when gallery invigilators dressed in black stood behind its columns. More than any other practising architect today, Ishigami is a magician of materials, an architectural alchemist who seems able to bend the laws of physics with his surreal, poetic work.Having worked at Pritzker prize-winning practice SANAA (designers of the 2009 pavilion), Ishigami established his own office in 2004. Since then, he has built a series of critically acclaimed projects that take the sub-zero minimalism of his former employers and crank down the dial a good few notches. Of the recent wave of Japanese architects, he is the most experimental and most demanding, working in a manner more akin to an artist than a conventional maker of buildings.As his groundbreaking exhibition at the Fondation Cartier in Paris showed last year, he pushes his ideas to the ultimate extreme with a singleminded ruthlessness that few can achieve. His office is famously tough to work in, but the results seem worth the effort. He is currently planning a housing scheme in south-west China that embraces a field of great boulders already on the hillside side, by placing a simple canopy over the landscape, arranging the rooms around the rocks. He is building a restaurant in Japan that looks like something tunnelled out of the ground by giant worms. For an extension to his celebrated workshop at the Kanagawa Institute of Technology workshop, he is planning to “make a sky” out of a continuous plane of steel just 12mm thick, drooping above a space 110 metres long and 70 metres wide – without a single supporting column in sight.If the Serpentine’s fabricators can pull off Ishigami’s exacting standards, we will be treated to a touch of magic this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f298e160036dbfba3b6735a3bfcc9c39040164e/0_1019_3969_2381/master/3969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=692788aabc88cf68f36bd11ba3af7f7c","title":"gordon parks early work photography","story":"In the 1940s, Parks went from being a self-taught photographer to an in-demand figure in the industry, shooting for Ebony, Vogue, Fortune and Life.

On this week’s books podcast, the ’s resident thriller fan Alison Flood struggled to finish The Flower Girls, a new thriller by Alice Clark-Platts, the plot of which contains similarities to the James Bulger murder case.

However, Airbus said a “significant number” of staff will move to production of other, more popular models and major job losses in the UK are not expected as a result of the announcement.Rhys McCarthy, the national officer for aerospace at Unite, said the union is seeking assurances from Airbus that there will be no job losses. He added that companies in the A380 supply chain, including Redditch-based GKN, are a “key concern”.Tom Enders, Airbus’s outgoing chief executive, said the cancellation was “painful for us”. He said: “We have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years.”Speaking at Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, Enders said the effect on jobs in the UK “needs to be evaluated”. He said: “Hopefully we can reuse and redeploy a significant number of employees there.“What we’re seeing here is the end of the large, four-engine aircraft,” said Enders, who admitted that the company was a decade late in developing the superjumbo. Boeing, Airbus’s American arch-rival, this month celebrated 50 years of production of its 747.Engines for the A380 are produced in Derby by Rolls-Royce, another major British aerospace employer, although it is thought that the effect on UK jobs numbers will be small.In a statement, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace president, said: “The A380 is a world-class feat of engineering, much loved by passengers, and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end.”Airbus said that more than 190 million passengers have flown in the A380 since the first plane rolled off the assembly line in Toulouse, France, in 2007. However, the plane, which can theoretically carry as many as 800 passengers, has struggled for profitability as demand for mid-sized jets boomed.However, the A380 cancellation will add another element of uncertainty for the future of UK operations already threatened by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Enders last month decried “Brexiteers’ madness”, saying that future investment decisions would be influenced if Brexit led to significant trade frictions.Enders on Thursday said he believed the “voices of reason” would prevail, avoiding a no-deal Brexit. In June last year Airbus said there would be a cost of €1bn (about £880m) for every week of delay in production. The company and its suppliers have built up buffer stocks of about €1bn, in line with estimates made in June.Enders said: “Looking at the situation as it is I’m still optimistic that a solution can be found that avoids a fall from a cliff.”The end of the A380 may free up space at Airbus’s Toulouse and Hamburg facilities, where final assembly is currently carried out, giving them a boost in the competition for business with the UK.

Since the referendum, the UK’s economic growth has slowed while the rest of the world has recorded one of its strongest periods for growth of the past decade.Vlieghe’s estimate for the weekly cost of Brexit so far is more than double the £350m the Leave campaign claimed could be saved on EU membership fees and instead spent on the NHS. The claim, emblazoned on the side of the campaign’s battlebus, became a key focus for debate in the run-up to the vote. “It is very unusual for investment to shrink that much when the rest of the world is doing pretty much just fine, until at least recently.“UK growth in the past two years has been weaker than we would have expected based on the performance of the global economy alone,” he said. “Based on what happened in the rest of the world we would have expected UK growth to accelerate but actually it slowed.” Several estimates have been made before to quantify the cost of the Brexit vote. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, has previously said the vote cost households about £900 each in lost income. There are also various estimates for the potential hit from Britain crashing out without a deal on 29 March.Threadneedle Street estimates the worst-case disruptive scenario could spark a slump into a recession with worse consequences for Britain than the 2008 financial crisis, while the Treasury estimates that all Brexit options are worse for the economy than remaining in the EU.Vlieghe, an independent economist on the Bank’s nine-member MPC, said the magnitude of the potential negative hit to the economy was uncertain, particularly over the long term.While he said there was an important democratic debate on the possible trade-offs between the political and economic consequences of Brexit, he added that leaving the EU without a deal could warrant an emergency cut in interest rates.“In the case of a no-deal scenario I judge that an easing or an extended pause in monetary policy is more likely to be the appropriate policy than a tightening,” he said.However, should Britain secure a smooth Brexit deal, the world economy manage to avert a further slowdown and inflationary pressure in Britain rise, he said it would be appropriate for the Bank to raise rates around once per year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/619ba27d76767aa7ad3775303a2686a9bbe9bdbc/96_9_2313_1388/master/2313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=039b9ff1103eae06700bec91de114966","title":"passengers love airbus a380 but it never fully took off with buyers","story":"Even as it first entered service in 2007, orders were piling up for rival in the pipeline from BoeingLooking at a plane this enormous, it felt a miracle that it could fly. And not only fly but soar so quietly, especially compared with the Boeing 747 it was designed to supersede and outclass. Passengers love it. But among the airline buyers, the A380 never completely took off.The announcement from Airbus that the final curtain will come down on the A380’s pan-European production line comes after years of speculation that the superjumbo was doomed. Orders had dried up in a risk-averse airline industry, whose economics and route networks were altered just at the wrong moment for the A380.Airbus had nosed ahead of the pack in producing a plane built with lighter materials, much more fuel-efficient, and potentially offering big savings and profits on routes where airlines could guarantee to load hundreds of passengers on every flight.However, even as the first A380 entered service in 2007, the orders were piling up for a different plane still in the pipeline from rival Boeing: the 787 Dreamliner, which could fly a similar range on only two engines, carrying a more viable number of passengers, making more routes possible.The hub and spokes model of aviation – where airlines competed for space at crowded intercontinental airports with connecting passengers, and the bigger the long-haul plane the better – was evolving. The need for Airbus’s expensive double-decker – wings so wide that airport stands and equipment had to be remodelled to accommodate it – was fading.The doubts escalated into a downward spiral when few customers were willing to take a punt on planning for a plane whose future was in question. Only one airline, Emirates, appeared fully behind it, placing giant orders that were single-handedly sustaining the programme. British Airways talked up the plane’s virtues but talked down the price. Qantas, stung by teething problems as an early adopter, stalled on an order made in 2006 and finally axed it only last week. Even Air France cut back on the plane assembled in Toulouse.The most haunting sign was news that two of the first A380s, still in their infancy in aircraft years, were parked in the Pyrenees and being stripped for parts. The aircraft were being reduced from great birds of the sky to mere organ donors in a decade – but it was a more economical solution for their owner than trying to lease them to unwilling airlines.When Emirates finally decided enough was enough, seeking to convert its order to newer, smaller models, it was game over. Few can blame Airbus for wanting to cling on and push this incredible plane, whose virtues are unquestioned. But the world it was built for has not panned out as Airbus hoped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af4cc84ca81e178320b1363aef9b7a527e3002f/0_0_4155_2493/master/4155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b674b79cbdb25a0a0a16b4d89c3dd742","title":"cat ladders a creative solution for felines in flats in pictures","story":"Strategically placed ramps and ladders for urban cats are all the rage in Bern.

Be careful what you wish for.In response to this demand, from 2011 David Cameron instructed the Office for National Statistics to gather data on people’s self-reported happiness and life satisfaction. Little practical good has come from this so far, but a new report by George Bangham for the Resolution Foundation is one of the best attempts to make useful sense of the data. He concludes: “The best prospects for policymakers targeting future increases in national wellbeing lie in raising job quality, raising incomes, particularly at the lower end, and policies to improve security in the housing market.”But I doubt Bangham is a happy man today, because almost all the media coverage has more or less ignored all this worthy, vaguely leftist stuff and instead latched on to the finding that people are happiest at ages 16 and 70.Such misplaced attention is par for the course. People are fascinated by how factors such as age, genes, gender, sexuality, weight, diet and ethnicity might determine happiness. Focusing on factors such as these also allows us to neatly depoliticise the issue. Some of these factors are things we have no control over, licensing us to resign ourselves to fate. The rest are things we are able to take some personal control over, which makes us feel empowered but also less compassionate towards those who refuse to do the right thing – and less inclined to make governments take their share of responsibility for wellbeing.But as the author and academic Michael Marmot’s groundbreaking 2010 report, Fair Society Healthy Lives, has shown, many of the most important determinants of wellbeing have nothing to do with personal choice or destiny. Rather, they are social and, as such, inescapably political.Two years after Marmot’s report, a new tube map of London was created to highlight inequality in the capital: among its striking findings was that along the Jubilee line, life expectancy falls from 86 in Westminster to 79 in Canning Town – roughly a year for every stop travelled east. This is explained purely by socioeconomic factors.Even the age correlation turns out to be inextricably linked to politics, despite the fact that no political party can make a difference to your date of birth. The happiness of pensioners is not just a function of their age, but of policy. On average, 70-year-old boomers today are the most affluent retirees in history, often owning their own homes and in receipt of generous pensions. People of 70 are not going to be as content in 30 or 40 years’ time if they are unable to retire, don’t own their homes and have small incomes. The flourishing of pensioners today is not biological destiny, but the fruit of decades of public policy.However, the age-related findings do shine some light on what we need to do to increase life satisfaction. In one way, the statistical equating of the quantity of happiness of 16- and 70-year-olds obscures the ways in which the quality of that happiness is completely different. A teenager’s joy is rooted in an exciting balance between innocence and experience, actuality and potentiality. An older person’s contentment is usually connected with an end of striving and quieter appreciation of what they have done and what they still can do. This should remind us that life satisfaction is a complex issue and could never be captured on a simple scale of one to 10.However, there is one respect in which teens and recent retirees are remarkably similar. Compared to other age groups, they tend to inhabit a sweet spot of having high degrees of both freedom and carefreeness. The typical 16-year-old has new freedoms without ever having had any serious responsibilities. The typical 70-year-old, having experienced a lifetime of work and family duties, has a very different kind of freedom, one born from relief.It should not surprise us to find that people tend to be happier when they have fewer worries. But this, too, has important political implications. If the government is really interested in raising gross national happiness, it has to make sure as many citizens as possible feel secure in their health, their housing and their incomes. Different states’ records in achieving this is one important reason why Nordic countries repeatedly score highly in international life satisfaction surveys and North America underperforms relative to its GDP.Whichever way you look at it, there is no escaping the conclusion that increasing wellbeing across society requires joined-up, long-term policy efforts. This is exactly what the Resolution Foundation recommends. Contrary to the headlines, the study does not show that the secret of happiness is to be 16 or 70. It is that wellbeing flourishes when people have freedom and security. A correct reading of the wellbeing data puts the ball very much in the government’s court.• Julian Baggini is a writer and philosopher"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb8a4bfed86ac44788b76ead3591ae5e2288e0b/0_81_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c8203a415909e823cd24d2cbdd6baf","title":"remain theresa may brexit deal article 50","story":"Although some plans are being talked up and others talked down, Theresa May knows everything is still to play forEven at the best of times, politics can be a place of deception and a hall of mirrors. High politics and low calculation are inseparable in the way MPs cast their votes. For some of us, that’s part of what makes politics so fascinating. But, over Brexit, the mirrors glint and deceive more than ever.As the Commons prepares for yet another day’s voting on Brexit today, with more votes to come later this month and in March, this always needs remembering. Today’s votes are skirmishes in a campaign of positioning, not the full battle. Thus far, none of the big Commons votes have meant precisely what they may appear to mean.The most prominent example illustrates this. Theresa May’s deal with the EU was massively trashed in the Commons on 15 January by 230 votes. Yet many Conservative MPs voted against it in the full knowledge that it was not the final word on the subject. Two weeks later, most of them lined up behind the so-called Brady amendment, which gives the bulk of May’s original deal a second chance.Amid the fog of the conflict, it can be tempting to assume that more has been settled in the politics of Brexit than is the case. The reality is that most of the big options, and some small ones, are still in play. Just as May’s deal may yet survive largely intact, complete with a version of the Northern Ireland backstop, so other options that stretch from a Norway-style soft Brexit to an exit without a deal – all of which have their supporters at Westminster – cannot be ruled out.The underlying reasons for this uncertainty are unchanged too. The European issue is huge, complex and isive. Parliament and government are still struggling to adjust to a referendum vote they mostly do not support and which is not easy to implement. And we have a hung parliament. The combination is a recipe for instability and uncertainty. Ever since the vote for the Brady amendment on 29 January, May has claimed that she has a “substantial and sustainable” majority for her attempt to fettle the backstop and get the deal through the Commons. Well, of course she says that. It’s in her interest. She wants to weaken the will of her rebels.But that does not make it true. The majority for Brady was a single frame from a moving film. The movie has already moved on. May’s motion for today’s debate got into trouble with the Tory rebels yesterday precisely because it acknowledges another truth – that there is also a Westminster majority against no deal – that the rebels will not accept. Substantial majority? Pull the other one.That is the same reason why reports of the death of the Cooper-Boles amendment have also been premature and exaggerated. That amendment, which proposed an extension to the article 50 process to prevent a no-deal Brexit, went down by 23 votes two weeks ago. One of the reasons it fell, however, is that 24 Labour MPs voted against it or abstained. Some of them did so, in part, because they didn’t want to be tarred with voting to prolong Brexit when, in fact, it may be prolonged anyway – exactly as the UK’s chief negotiator Olly Robbins was overheard predicting this week.Whatever happens in the Commons tonight, these alternatives not only live to fight another day but may also win in the end. This week, May called on Tory MPs to hold their nerve while she continues her quest for a saleable version of the backstop. But the same advice applies with equal force to the moderates across the Commons who want to emerge with a softer Brexit deal than May has proposed. Their moment could yet come.To say this is not to be in denial. On the contrary, it is to recognise the facts. Looking through the history of Brexit since July 2016 when she became prime minister, three truths can be discerned about May’s approach. The first is that she needs to deliver the least-worst Brexit deal for the country. The second is that she is determined to avoid no-deal. The third is that she wants Brexit to be delivered by the Conservative party and its parliamentary allies.Her problem, all along, is that these three ducks won’t line up. That is extremely unlikely to change. The real problem is that third duck. May remains absolutely Tory-focused on Brexit. But there are not enough Tory and DUP MPs who will vote for the kind of deal she craves. The 15 January rejection, in which 118 Tory MPs voted against her deal, undoubtedly exaggerated the internal opposition. But those 118 will not all come back into line at the end of the month, or in March. Some of them will. Some of them won’t – perhaps including the DUP.In other words, a Brexit deal will only happen with some opposition support. But how much will May need? Not even the chief whip knows. Jeremy Corbyn, who supports Brexit but who wants the Tories to own it, blurs many calculations. Yet not all of the Labour MPs who failed to support Cooper-Boles are supporters of May’s deal. Some them just don’t want to be responsible for an article 50 extension. What is more, they may get their wish, if what Robbins was overheard saying in that Brussels hotel bar on Tuesday night by ITV News’s Angus Walker were to happen.Ever since 29 January, when the Brady amendment was carried and the Cooper-Boles amendment was lost, many have assumed that the die was cast. There is a mood of fatalism in remainer Britain that, after those votes, May is finally going to deliver a Tory-facing Brexit. Yes, that could happen. But the facts and the numbers don’t yet support that view. Facts and numbers still count for a lot, even in a hall of mirrors. But leadership counts for even more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa51401ba97e6e1111d3adc5150c8defe232dc28/0_131_4850_2910/master/4850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee31d35ad7476de8a19371e1a0b093a0","title":"shamima begum grooming islamic state pregnant uk","story":"It’s impossible not to feel a jolt of shock when confronted with the photo of Shamima Begum on the front page of this morning’s Times. Four years ago – when we last saw her – it was accepted that Begum had been brainwashed. There was consensus that she was an innocent child who’d been groomed online. Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation’s narrative – one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming – because that demanded nothing from us. She was the little girl who’d been caught up in a dangerous death cult the pixelated image of a kid caught on CCTV about to fly, and that was sad.It was also made easier by her absence. We only needed to empathise with Begum’s situation in the abstract. Of course, we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately. But that was just a fantasy. I can’t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad. Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp, Begum is no longer an abstract concept. Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom – especially given her apparent lack of remorse. And yet is she not still a victim of grooming? Still a British citizen we should be looking to help? There are already those arguing that since Begum left the UK to join Islamic State four years ago her situation has changed entirely. Ex counter-terrorism chief Mark Rowley told the Today programme on Radio 4 this morning that when Begum was 15 he considered her a victim. Now she is an adult what happens next, he argued, should be determined by clinical risk assessment and the consideration of cold, hard facts. He wants us to separate those grainy images of a young girl from the crisp picture of the woman she is today.But to see Begum in isolation to past events serves no purpose. The brainwashed child she was has everything to do with the brainwashed young woman she has become. That’s not to justify what she has done, but to see the series of events that have unfolded in her life as being traceable directly back to her grooming and subsequent radicalisation. Children are influenced by those around them, a product of their environment. We only develop and learn to be better when another influence takes a bad one’s place. Since the age of 15 Begum has not been afforded that opportunity in the caliphate it is unsurprising her views continue to be as dangerous as when she left – they’ve become her norm.If she seems untroubled by the violence she has witnessed, that’s no more a sign of a callous and wicked villain than a vulnerable young woman who is profoundly scarred. We know that trauma in childhood impacts your experiences as you grow older. I can’t begin to imagine what she has seen in her life, what it’s like to have had two children die. What we told ourselves about that 15-year-old girl remains true to this day, except now helping this young woman requires more than just easy words.That’s not to say Begum is to receive a hero’s welcome back at Gatwick airport. To rehabilitate and reintegrate her back into society will take much work by dedicated professionals, be in no doubt. But to try to help her must be better than leaving this teenager to languish in a camp, to quite possibly witness her third child die. If rehabilitation proves impossible, at least back in Britain she can live under supervision and be kept from doing further harm – to herself or to others. And should, one day soon, Begum be in a position to rejoin British society proper, who could be better placed to warn other vulnerable children of the dangerous reality of online grooming, of radicalisation by extremists and the acts that led her to commit? Our justice system is based on the possibility of rehabilitation. It would be wrong to write off the prospect of anyone changing, let alone a vulnerable 19-year-old girl and her unborn child.• Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9c54ae5dab8417651c3c371ff37fb4e9938eb6f/0_0_941_568/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0149a269d560c308a25c66e8660b6ce6 1370w","title":"universities stamp out creativity are graduates ready for work","story":"Universities are changing the way they teach to prepare students for a future in which lots of jobs will be automatedA few numbers are enough to sum up how far the world of work is changing. More than six million workers fear their jobs could be replaced by machines in the next 10 years. Around 1.1 million people now work in the gig economy, using online platforms to find small, often on-demand, jobs. And a third of graduates find themselves mismatched to the jobs they secure on graduation.What universities can do to prepare their graduates for an unknown future was the subject of a roundtable, sponsored by HSBC, held in Birmingham last week and attended by senior academic leaders, employers and policy-makers.It emerged that the numbers did not paint the full picture. Take automation: Scott Corfe, chief economist at the Social Market Foundation, pointed out that automation did not necessarily mean fewer jobs – just different ones. And politicians were wrong to assume that these would largely be in programming in fact, programming was likely to be automated in future, while more creative skills would still be in demand. “The key thing is to enable people to reskill and move around the job market in a more nimble way than they currently can do,” he said.Paul Faulkner, chief executive of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, questioned the idea that an ever-changing, unknown jobs future was something new. “Every generation will have felt that way.”Were students graduating without the skills needed by employers? It was important not to confuse learning skills with content that becomes quickly outdated, said Kathy Armour, pro vice-chancellor (education) at the University of Birmingham, while Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and chief executive of Aston University, said content matters but mainly as “the context around which you can develop skills and attributes”.The consensus was that whatever the future of work looked like, it would demand creativity.Julie Ward, Labour MEP for north-west England, stressed the importance of including arts in the emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics as key subjects, so that Stem becomes Steam. Parents who advised their children that taking arts subjects would harm their job prospects were making a mistake, she said.Yvonne Brown, senior lecturer in management and human resources at Coventry University, said universities needed to ensure the way they assessed students encouraged teamwork and a creative approach to learning. It wasn’t just creativity that employers looked for, added Graham Thompsett, people capability director at Jaguar Land Rover – it was also curiosity. “There isn’t enough of that.”Mike Rowley, partner and head of education at KPMG, said his company did not focus on a particular degree or content but on softer skills, which he argued should be taught to students at an earlier stage in the education system.Work experience was essential in developing these skills, speakers agreed. Professor Philip Plowden, vice-chancellor of Birmingham City University, said work placements or experiential learning were invaluable in closing attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Not everyone approached the world of work from the same starting point: many students at Birmingham City came from deprived backgrounds and even short placements could help demystify office life and behaviour. “We talk about preparing students for an unknown future,” he said. “For a lot of my students it’s an unknown present.”Work placements had another value too – in preserving students’ innate abilities. “I think sometimes universities inadvertently stamp out creativity,” he suggested. “I have watched law students coming in with oodles of common sense from their everyday lives. You start teaching them and within about a year they can give you a lecture on contract law, but can’t solve a problem any more they could probably have solved when they came in.”Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said another way of equipping students with transferable skills was enabling them to work closely with researchers to become independent learners and researchers in their own right.But students needed to pick up more than learning skills from universities to have successful careers, argued Frances Howell, managing director and head of corporate banking Midlands Region, at HSBC. “Another thing that’s really important is around building the strength and skills of iniduals to manage mental wellbeing,” she said. Jason Arday, senior teaching fellow in the Centre for Education Studies at the University of Warwick, said students felt they were paying a lot of money to be at university and that had changed attitudes towards the skills institutions needed to deliver.But it was not all up to universities, said Thompsett. Employers needed to change too. This meant working more closely with universities to develop skills and find suitable – and erse – recruits.Plowden said he would “vehemently disagree” with any suggestion that universities were just about getting a job. But for Cameron it was “base level hygiene”. While he appreciated the sense of civic engagement, morals and values he derived from his university education, his ability to appreciate it all had been underpinned by the fact that he was employed, and universities failed their students if they did not give them that opportunity.For Sandy Lindsay, founder and chair at the communications consultancy Tangerine, apprenticeships offered one solution. She set up the Juice Academy, a digital marketing apprenticeship programme, because she felt digital marketing was too fast-changing to be taught at the slow pace of a university setting.Yet she felt the government’s current apprenticeship programme was a missed opportunity, lacking essential flexibility. And Plowden agreed that the bureaucracy involved was such that the apprenticeship system “makes us look like Usain Bolt”.Slowness was particularly problematic in the pace of change on ersity, argued Arday. He was concerned at the persistent attainment gap between white and black and minority ethnic students and felt this was reinforced by the dearth of people of colour in leadership positions in universities or industry. “We don’t have a model reflective of the student population,” he argued.But while many agreed that universities needed to be faster at responding to change, the solution was not just extra speed, countered Armour. She made the case for “slow learning”, rejecting the government’s enthusiasm for accelerated two-year courses in favour of a more modular approach, interspersed with periods of work. Why do we study for three years, she asked, rather than seven? “The idea that you will be able at 18 to study something and three years later you’ll have everything you need to take you through until you’re 75 is fanciful. If it ever were true it’s certainly not true now.”She predicted that universities would remain trusted providers of education but there would be new ways to package material into microchunks. Only a few years ago, music lovers could only buy records on an LP, but now most young people buy bits and pieces through iTunes, she said. “You can see a lot of students who might want to package their learning somewhat differently over a life course,” she said. “That seems to me where the future is.”Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and chief executive professor of Aston UniversitySandy Lindsay, founder and chair at Tangerine \u0026amp The Juice AcademyFrances Howell, managing director and head of corporate banking, Midlands Region, HSBCPaul Faulkner, CEO, Birmingham Chamber of CommerceJulie Ward, Labour MEP for north-west EnglandMichael Rowley, partner and head of education, KPMGProfessor Philip Plowden, vice-chancellor of Birmingham City UniversityProfessor Kathy Armour, pro-vice-chancellor (education), University of BirminghamGraham Thompsett, people capability director, Jaguar Land RoverYvonne Browne, senior lecturer in management and human resources, Coventry University LondonJason Arday, senior teaching fellow in the Centre for Education Studies, University of WarwickSarah Stevens, head of policy, the Russell Group"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78938ac2710ad76dd0fd5fee401d4aa1d4a336c/0_43_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=633166e8941d1791f4862f1b98f7dbcd","title":"uk pupils climate change strike headteachers unions schools","story":"Unions urge pupils not to walk out of class but some schools may adopt relaxed attitudeSchool leaders are having to wrestle with their consciences over pupils joining the nationwide climate strike to be held on Friday afternoon, caught between their duties as teachers and instincts as educators.Thousands of the more than 8 million school pupils in the UK are expected to walk out of lessons to show their concern about the threat of escalating climate change.Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman and a former science teacher, said she will be joining a rally in Oxford and urged school leaders to accommodate pupils who join the protests.“As a former teacher I absolutely understand the frustrations that teachers and schools may have with these strikes. However, I would describe this as a teachable moment,” said Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon.“I hope schools, colleges and universities see this in the positive light it is meant and equally hope those students act sensibly with making sure adults know where they are and making up the missed work.”But the National Association of Head Teachers, which last week offered some support for those joining the strike, gave a more hard-headed assessment to its members as the day of the action approached.“Pupils should only be out of school in exceptional circumstances. Whilst NAHT supports the right of young people to express themselves, first and foremost, pupils should be in school during term time,” the union said.“While a school leader’s role is to ensure children attend school, are kept safe and receive a good quality of education, it is right that inidual school leaders can decide how best to respond to any proposed protest by students in their school on Friday.”The Department for Education’s guidance says unauthorised absences must be recorded as part of safeguarding, but gives room for headteachers to approve absences in “exceptional circumstances”.The organisers have written form letters for the parents of those wanting to take part, which argue that protesting qualifies as civic engagement and climate change is an exceptional circumstance.With the strike taking place on the final day before half-term holidays in many parts of England, some schools may adopt a relaxed attitude. But others have already informed their students any absence will be noted as unauthorised.Geoff Barton, a former secondary school headteacher who now leads the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “While we understand the strength of feeling over the very important issue of climate change, we would urge pupils against walking out of school on Friday.“It is extremely disruptive for a school to have to deal with unauthorised absences and pupils will be missing out on important learning time.”The day of action follows the example of Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl who began protesting outside her country’s parliament in August. Her solo effort has since grown and spread to countries around the world including Germany and Australia.In a letter to the , more than 200 UK academics said they offered “full support” to the school strikers. “They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b72a75f26de1130eac3446edc7651aee3e0ef27/0_391_5834_3501/master/5834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35449bf0c421b8592eeb9ea7bda6e228","title":"wildlife photographer year people choice winner in pictures","story":"David Lloyd’s Bond of Brothers, a heartwarming image of an affectionate pair of male lions, has been crowned the winner of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Lumix people’s choice award.

And the answers are always illuminating, given that these three remain among the most watched and beloved movies of all time. But were they recognised as such by the Academy? Were they billy-o. Instead, the winners those years were, respectively, Ordinary People (the ultimate downer movie no one would watch today by choice), Terms of Endearment (ditto) and Out of Africa (the definition of a movie that was very much of its time), while the movies that people still actually watch today were fobbed off with technical and sound nominations.Which brings me to Black Panther. There was something of a furore a few months ago when the Academy suggested bringing in an extra category, outstanding achievement in popular film, a clear acknowledgment that Black Panther should win best film, but won’t because, well, it’s no Ordinary People. (Although it could have been called Out of Africa, albeit this time focusing on actual black Africans instead of just white Europeans.) But people got very cross about this, and said the category was an insult to the Oscars, which are – and I quote one film commentator – “a celebration of excellence”. This person was presumably in a coma when Argo won. Anyway, the proposed new category was binned and, with it, Black Panther’s chances of going home with much more than best production design.I’m so tired of people acting like comedies and action movies are somehow less “excellent”, or artistic, or good, than self-conscious dramas full of Serious Actors doing their Serious Acting. Who, honestly, would argue that Trading Places is less excellent than Out of Africa, for heaven’s sake? Good action movies and comedies require so much skill, far more than simply looking moodily off into the middle distance and whacking Adagio in G Minor on the soundtrack. And if there’s any film that should hammer the nail into the coffin of this pervasive nonsense, it’s Black Panther.By anyone’s measure, Black Panther is a very good movie: gripping, smart, beautiful, fully engaged with modern issues, thrillingly zeitgeisty and with terrific performances, especially from Michael B Jordan and Letitia Wright. I am generally no fan of superhero movies, especially the way they now dominate the industry, squeezing out the mid-market. But if the Oscars are to survive at all, they need to be interesting to more people and the fact is the movies most people are currently interested in are superhero movies. Black Panther would be the perfect movie with which the Academy could acknowledge this, given that it is a superhero movie, but also Oscar-level good, a movie that’s a genuine artistic and political achievement. After all, it is that almost unknown thing, an American movie with a largely black cast that is about neither slavery nor poverty, and is celebratory rather than depressing. I am trying to think of another first American movie with an almost entirely black cast that became a global blockbuster, and all I can come up with is Coming to America, which came out 31 years ago.I know Black Panther won’t win, you know Black Panther won’t win – even Black Panther knows it won’t win. Even its nomination feels decidedly begrudging. But dammit, it should. It says something important about 2018 and it feels properly seminal. But fine, whatever, give the Oscar to the beautiful black and white movie or the funny historical romp. Because lord knows those types of movies never win, whereas action movies celebrating black people come along every month, right?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Slogans in support of the IRA, INLA and a united Ireland feature on the short journey towards the Bogside Inn. Likewise, a large mural making plain what some of those in the vicinity feel the Northern Ireland assembly has delivered since inception in 1998: poverty, unemployment, enforcing British government cuts and food banks feature on the list.Officially, although besieged by questions, Derry City are making no comment about Brexit. The Football Association of Ireland has adopted an identical stance. The explanation for that lies in a theme common throughout the UK: uncertainty. The key themes, though, are easy to pinpoint: travel for supporters, movement of players, contracts, insurance, Uefa status. Derry City have a handful of players based in County Donegal, officially the Republic of Ireland. The core business of the club’s multimillionaire chairman and benefactor, Philip O’Doherty, has the same geographical status.It is left to those on the outside, with experience of what border controls in Ireland mean, to use pre-Good Friday agreement times as a reference point for messy checkpoint practicalities. “There were long queues you might well be pulled to one side and asked all sorts of questions about where you were going,” recalls Michael Kerrigan, who has barely missed a Derry fixture in more than three decades. “Maybe the bus you were on was a different colour five years earlier so you had to go through a process of identifying it: ‘Why was the bus colour changed?’ and that sort of thing. If you answered a question the ‘wrong’ way … It is much, much better at the moment plain sailing.“We don’t really know what’s going to happen regards the physicality of a border and of course we would have concerns. People can talk and talk but we don’t really know. We are hopeful things will be much as they are now. We aren’t politicians we just want to go and watch football.”Like so much in Northern Ireland, no assessment of an upcoming situation is possible without glances to the past. There remains resentment in Derry regarding the club being bundled firstly to Coleraine (because of security concerns) then out of the Belfast-based Irish League altogether in 1972. After a painful spell in the wilderness, Derry joined the League of Ireland in 1985, backed by home crowds of 12,000 and travelling support of routinely half that.Jim Roddy, a civic leader, applies further context. “We had no senior club to aspire to be part of so when the club came back the impact in the households of this city … it transformed people’s views of themselves, of this place,” he explains. “They had something that truly represented what they saw as their identity. A sporting giant to us.“It was four years after the hunger strikes and this was still a dangerous place. Soccer was an escape from what was happening on the street.Roddy is the fascinating embodiment of this city and a football club he served as a director for many years. He heads the Derry-Londonderry City Centre Initiative and is a go-to guy for Theresa May and Karen Bradley, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland. Roddy recounts recently taking Brandon Lewis for an ad hoc drive to “see” the Irish border. Suffice to say, the Conservative party chairman’s perception was outweighed by reality where a subtle change of road surface was the only defining point.It wasn’t always thus, of course. Roddy speaks from the heart when refusing to contemplate the Derry City support of 2019 encountering away trips that were common from 1985 to 1998. “It ain’t going to happen again, there isn’t going to be a hard border,” Roddy says. “For a start, no one wants it.“Certainly for supporters there was tension people would have resented being stopped by soldiers. Some of those soldiers would have been 18, 19, not even knowing what they were doing here. That’s the human reality. You’d have heard Scottish soldiers and you’d know that half of them would have been Celtic supporters – so would those calling them ‘Scottish ‘b’s’. A real anomaly.“It wasn’t easy. Not everybody had a drink but not everybody was dry. These were trips and see when you got across the border, you breathed a sigh of relief. Was it subconscious? I don’t know but it worked in reverse on the way back.“Look, it was an experience, an experience that could not be contemplated again. Never ever.”Interestingly, Roddy would not envisage Derry City back in the Irish League – which could easily be construed as cost-effective – as a trigger for social unrest but regards the scenario as unnecessary. “We’re not orced from our political set-up. If our leaders are not working together at executive level, then that permeates down to all levels. Does that make life difficult? Yes, it does.“But I’m a fervent believer that we should have a 12-team all-Ireland soccer league, properly resourced.”In Declan Devine, Derry have a manager born and bred in the locality. “We are sitting in an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in Ireland,” he says. “Whatever estate in Derry we come from, we have all had to fight for everything we have. We have come through a lot of hardship. This football represents these people and we have to make sure, as a minimum, we fight. We have to make sure that whoever we come up against, it is personal, it is a fight and an argument to make sure we aren’t overrun, outworked or bullied. Your football club represents your city.”The form by which that representation will continue is, for now, so desperately unclear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a94888a99dd06ac894889896735d9aae3f52ad07/597_117_2737_1642/master/2737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d865e4e2898bb4328c64bb5038d5615","title":"harry winks tottenham dortmund statement spurs mean business","story":"It is a lovely story, a real ratings winner, and one that bears retelling at times like these. As a 15-year-old Tottenham academy hopeful, Harry Winks was given the honour of being a flag-bearer before the club’s Champions League group phase tie against Real Madrid at White Hart Lane in 2011.It was an incredible thrill for him, being up close to Cristiano Ronaldo and all of the rest, but not least because first and foremost Winks is a Spurs fan who started going to home games with his father, Gary, when he was six or seven. By then, Winks had joined the club’s academy. He was five when that happened.On Wednesday at Wembley, on another grand Champions League occasion – the last 16, first-leg tie against Borussia Dortmund – Winks completed his journey from flag-bearer to standard-bearer. And when the dust had settled on a memorable 3-0 win, nobody felt the elation more than him.“I’ve been in the stands and I’ve watched Spurs play in the Champions League many years ago so to play, get the win and do as well as we did makes it that little bit more special,” Winks said. “It is up there with the greatest results I have had in a Spurs shirt. I am incredibly proud and delighted to be playing for the team.”The headlines went to Son Heung-min and Jan Vertonghen, scorers of the first and second goals, with the latter imposing himself out of position at left wing-back. But Winks was the quiet force behind the victory – one he described as a “statement” to the rest of Europe.Mauricio Pochettino has come to rely on Winks, particularly in the big Champions League games, preferring his playmaking skills in front of the backline to a more orthodox defensive presence. The manager prizes Winks’s composure in pressure situations, his ability to set the tempo with his passing and against Dortmund he got the team moving.“The manager told us at half-time what we needed to do tactically to get on top and it worked,” Winks said. “It was just about when we went to press it was to be more aggressive and more compact. He wanted us – from the defenders to the attackers – to be as compact as possible and to press as a unit. That was the most important message he gave to us.”One of the things that stood out was Spurs’s patience and maturity. At this stage of the competition last season, they notoriously lost their focus against Juventus, conceding two goals in three minutes and a position of strength to exit. When they got on top this time, they tightened their grip.“We have been in the Champions League for the last couple of years so we are starting to learn what teams are like,” Winks said. “Any small mistake gets punished. We have to be on it from minute one to full time. We have watched games back from the past where we have lost and we have taken a lot on board.”The message from within the squad is that nothing will be taken for granted before the second leg on 5 March. But they are aware of the magnitude of Wednesday’s result and the possibilities that it has opened up.“We hope it’s a statement to show that we are up there, we mean business and we want to go as far as we can in the Champions League,” Winks said. “There is no better way of doing that than beating Dortmund 3-0 at home. We have got to win the second leg first before we can even look at how far we can go. But it’s a great result, hopefully we can progress and who knows where we can go?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/141ff8cf9a2be0fa464641b1b1e8ab050da1944a/0_172_2686_1611/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61d87d0b20bbdccec180ab724ec68958","title":"jose mourinho manchester united payoff staff","story":"Manchester United have revealed that José Mourinho and his staff received a £19.6m payoff following the Portuguese’s sacking at Old Trafford.The staggering sum was disclosed in figures released on Thursday in the club’s half-yearly accounts. It was called an “exceptional item relating to compensation to the former manager and certain members of the coaching staff for loss of office”. The other coaching staff thought to be compensated are senior goalkeeping coach Silvino Louro, opposition scout Ricardo Formosinho, fitness coaches Stefano Rapetti and Carlos Lalin and analyst Giovanni Cerra, although Mourinho is expected to have received the bulk of the money.Mourinho earned around £15m a year but was removed 17 league matches into his third season, United having made their poorest start since 1990, sitting 19 points off the top of the table and 11 from a Champions League berth. Under caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær the club have won 10 out of 12 matches in all competitions and are now fourth in the Premier League.In two full seasons at Old Trafford, Mourinho won the Europa League and League Cup before finishing second in the Premier League last season and reaching the FA Cup final, where United lost 1-0 to Chelsea.

I’ve no interest in finishing playing anytime soon though.”Amond, who is the League Two club’s top scorer with 18 goals, laughs when it is put to him that what he is doing with Newport is the equivalent of Sergio Agüero coaching City’s schoolboys on an evening. “Yeah,” says Amond, pausing for a moment as he tries to picture that scene. “He’s probably not doing that, is he? I wish I had his bank balance!”Agüero would no doubt have been impressed with the goal that Amond scored to double Newport’s lead against Middlesbrough in last week’s FA Cup replay. In a move straight off the training ground, Amond darted to the near post to sweep home a glorious first-time shot, on the half volley, from a short corner. It was so good that it is tempting to wonder how many times he has watched it back. “A few,” Amond says. “A few hundred!”“I’ve never hit a ball as sweet in my life. But I’ll be honest with you, I specifically went through that technique the night before here, coaching with one of the young strikers. It wasn’t a set piece we were working on, it was just the timing of your run across the near post, so when the ball is coming back, and what way to hit it.“With that goal against Middlesbrough, there’s a split-second where I’m the only person either in the ground, or watching the game on TV, who knows where that’s going and it’s like time slows down. The moment it came off my foot, I knew it was in the top corner. And for that split-second it’s the best feeling in the world. If you could bottle that feeling and sell it, you would be a multi-millionaire.”Manchester City have plenty of those within their star-studded squad and it will be fascinating to see how they cope with the humble surroundings of Rodney Parade, in particular a playing surface that has been battered by the combination of rugby, football and poor weather. “I think the pitch looks a lot worse than it is,” Amond says. “But I wouldn’t be surprised if City rocked up with their own groundstaff to work on it before the game.”Amond is talking in a dugout next to the pitch where he has been coaching for more than two hours. If he is tired and keen to get home and out of the cold – the temperature has plummeted – he does a good job of disguising it. Gregarious and generous with his time, he is an instantly likeable character and has quite a CV. “I’m the weirdest League Two footballer ever,” Amond says, laughing.With a prolific record in the lower leagues, and some hugely impressive performances in the FA Cup this season and last, Amond is entitled to wonder whether he is capable of making that step up. “I still believe I can play at a high level,” he says. “I still believe I can play for Ireland. And maybe the last couple of months has given me more belief and determination than ever.”Amond has had a few brushes with the big-time, none more so than in July 2009 when he was in the Shamrock Rovers side that hosted Real Madrid in a pre-season friendly. Ronaldo had not long completed his then world-record £80m transfer from Manchester United, meaning that the 10,000 fans shoehorned into the Tallaght Stadium were treated to the sight of the Portugal international making his first Real Madrid appearance.Shamrock lost 1-0, courtesy of a late Karim Benzema goal, but Amond came away with a prized possession. “The half-time whistle was approaching and everyone was shuffling towards Ronaldo to try to get his shirt. I saw Raúl loosening his top and asked if I could have his. He said I could and then gestured for me to swap mine. I said: ‘I think I’m playing the second half.’”Amond breaks into laughter as he tells that story but his expression quickly changes when asked whether he plans to get a City shirt. “It doesn’t cross my mind. This is a game I want to win – as stupid as that might sound. The good thing is that it’s at our place, not at the Etihad, because you saw what they did to Chelsea. The likelihood is that they could do it to us.“But you have to believe you can go and win a game. There’s no point in me doing an interview like this with you if I trivialise it by saying it will be a great day for the club. I want to make it a great day for us. I want to enjoy the day the right way, like I did against Leeds, Spurs, Leicester and Middlesbrough. Whether it’s blind faith or not, I don’t know. But I still believe we can do something.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9b0afc9c047b015aca5f42f8f3e7f18b46b39e/0_14_3106_1864/master/3106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9c1f6c94efe03300e0140edc716be5c","title":"uwe rosler malmo chelsea europa league","story":"“I had just made my first appearance for the club as a sub and he came over and said ‘I expect more from you. I didn’t sign you to run around and then be tired after five minutes’,” recalls Marcus Antonsson. “First you think ‘woah, hang on’ but then you realise that he is very demanding and that you’re not going to get away with anything.”The manager who gave Antonsson a dressing down after his first few minutes as a Malmö FF player is Uwe Rösler, the German who has revitalised the club after being appointed in June 2018 and who is now preparing to face Chelsea in the Europa League on Thursday.Malmö FF were going nowhere when the former Brentford, Wigan and Leeds manager took over and shook up the club. Having won the Swedish title in 2017 they were mid-table with no signs of climbing the table by the time he arrived. He came with the backing of the former MFF coach Åge Hareide and, according to Swedish paper Aftonbladet, beat Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the current Manchester United manager, to the job.Rösler took one look at the squad, recognised the talent within it, and then started working on the players’ fitness. The results were remarkable. Malmö FF went undefeated in Rösler’s first 17 games, rose to third in the table and qualified for the Europa League last 32 by finishing above Besiktas in their group. This week Chelsea arrive at a sold-out Stadion.“The draw could not have been much harder,” concedes Antonsson, “but I guess the hope is that they will underestimate us somewhat. The key is to play a top, top game at home and then take it from there.”A feverish atmosphere will await Chelsea but Rösler is concerned of a backlash after the humiliation at the Etihad last Sunday, when Maurizio Sarri’s side lost 6-0.“Chelsea are like a wounded animal at the moment,” Rösler said this week. “It is an unusual situation for a club like Chelsea but I hope they arrive with all their star players. I hope that our supporters will be able to watch a world class team and that we can show how far we have got. For me, that’s our biggest challenge. It is a fantastic challenge and that’s the same for the players too.”Rösler, who is a former East German international who played for Manchester City between 1994 and 1998 and whose son, Colin plays for the U19s, had mixed success as a manager in England. He came close to winning promotion to the Championship with Brentford in 2013 but lost in the play-off final and left the club later in the year. At Wigan he beat Manchester City in the FA Cup but departed after 11 months in the job and the club in the Championship relegation zone.He won only two out of 12 games in charge of Leeds United while he achieved Fleetwood’s highest position ever by coming fourth in League One before being sacked in February 2018 after seven straight defeats.At Malmö, he has impressed with his tactical flexibility and his ability to change formation depending on the opponents. “The more I think about it, the more I like a back three,” he told fotbollskanalen recently, before adding: “but then I’ve used 4-4-2 with a diamond, a straight 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 …”Rösler is happy to take his inspiration from a broad range of coaches and said last year: “I like how Jürgen Klopp’s teams play football as a general rule. I like Pep Guardiola’s beautiful football. I like Mourinho cynicism and, finally, Otto Rehhagel’s management style.”The key for Malmö, however, has been the improvement in fitness. They have not played a competitive game since beating Besiktas away on 13 December but the German has worked his players hard in the last four weeks, culminating in a brutal training camp in Marbella.The key player is without doubt the now 36-year-old Markus Rosenberg, who some people in England may remember from a less than successful spell at West Brom between 2012-14. He leads from the front, never giving the defenders any rest (although there were raised eyebrows in Sweden when David Luiz described him as a “fantastic” player).For Malmö the game has added poignancy as their chairman Håkan Jeppsson died in early December. Rösler is pensive as he talks about the man who was part of Malmö’s board for 14 years and who oversaw the club’s return to the top of the Swedish game in the past decade. “I still spend a lot of time thinking about Håkan,” Rösler said recently. “I don’t know because I did not know him for a long period of time, but it is refusing to go away.”The victory against Besiktas the week after the death of Jeppsson in December, which ultimately set up the Chelsea tie, was dedicated to the former chairman and for the first home game since his passing away, players and fans will want to make it a night to remember."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c2523b001639040e71cf3298815b49971ba9f5f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d41cc55086041605321aa401f3f58017","title":"europa league four fixtures following","story":"All the facts and figures for Celtic v Valencia, Galatasaray v Benfica, Krasnodar v Bayer and Shakhtar v Eintracht FrankfurtBy Martin Laurence for WhoScoredThe return of the Champions League has taken centre stage this week, but there are plenty of interesting ties in the Europa League, even if Arsenal and Chelsea received favourable draws. We have dissected four matches on Thursday that are worth following.Turkish champions Galatasaray endured a torrid first half of the season in the Süper Lig, though their fortunes have improved since the turn of the year. A run of seven wins in their last eight matches will have boosted morale, with the most recent of those victories, a 3-1 win against Trabzonspor, the most impressive.That victory on Sunday marked the debut of January signing Mbaye Diagne and the striker had a perfect start, scoring the opening goal from the penalty spot to pick up where he left off for fellow Süper Lig club Kasimpasa. The 27-year-old, unlike his new club, enjoyed a sensational start to the season, scoring 20 goals in 17 league appearances, and Fatih Terim (now in his fourth spell as Galatasaray manager) will hope his new marksman can lead his side past a very tough last-32 opponent.Galatasaray have been in great form lately but Benfica will take solace from that fact that their last defeat came against another Portuguese team. Porto did the double over Galatasaray in their Champions League group, relegating them to the Europa League.Benfica will be in superb spirits themselves, after back-to-back wins against Sporting in the Lisbon derby and a crushing 10-0 demolition job of Nacional on Sunday. Ljubomir Fejsa is sidelined for the trip to Istanbul, while left-back Alejandro Grimaldo and veteran striker Jonas are also doubts. All eyes will be on teenage sensation João Félix who, at 19, has caught the eye of Europe’s top clubs with five goals in his last six league games. He is undoubtedly one to watch in the future.Were it not for a refereeing decision, Valencia may still be in the Champions League. Marouane Fellaini appeared to handle the ball as he scored the goal that took Manchester United into the knockout stages and consigned Valencia to third place in the group, leaving Marcelino to lament the absence of VAR during the group stage. Uefa have acted, but it is too little too late for Valencia.The Spanish side do have pedigree in the Europa League though. They have won their last four round-of-32 ties and have done so in style, keeping clean sheets in seven of those eight games – including two 1-0 victories over Stoke City back in 2012.Celtic were unconvincing in their Europa League group, finishing nine points behind group winners Salzburg and only securing second place when RB Leipzig conceded an 86th-minute equaliser in their final match. However, they have hit top form at the right time. Having ended 2018 vulnerable in the title race after a defeat to Rangers in the Old Firm derby, Celtic have streaked clear in the league thanks to six straight wins. So far this year, they have scored 21 goals without conceding any. The arrival of some exciting January signings – including youngsters Timothy Weah and Oli Burke, who are eligible for the Europa League – has certainly helped.This will be the first meeting between the two sides since they were drawn together in the third round of the Uefa Cup in 2001, when Valencia won a penalty shootout at Celtic Park after both legs ended 1-0. Henrik Larsson scored Celtic’s only goal in that tie. With Fillip Benkovic and Kieran Tierney both unavailable, what the club would give for a talisman such as Larsson.Celtic need to make home advantage count in the first leg. Valencia did not win any of their away games in the Champions League group stage, even drawing at Young Boys, and have only won one of their last nine matches on the road in all competitions. If Celtic are to go through, they need a big performance in Glasgow.In what will be their first competitive match in two months given the extended winter break in Russia, Krasnodar host Peter Bosz’s new-look Bayer Leverkusen side. All three of Krasnodar’s home games in the group stage – Sevilla, Standard Liege and Akhisarspor – ended in 2-1 wins for the hosts and the conditions will certainly be a shock to the system for the visitors.That said, if any team can break down Krasnodar’s stubborn resolve, it could be Bayer Leverkusen. The appointment of a coach who was considered a failure at Borussia Dortmund may not have enthused the entire fanbase but Bosz has history in this tournament. He took Ajax to the final against Manchester United in 2017.The Dutchman has his new side playing some excellent attacking football. He has switched to a 4-3-3 formation and dropped youngster Julian Brandt into midfield alongside hot prospect Kai Havertz, and it is working so far. Both players were on the scoresheet last Friday in a 5-1 win at Mainz, a victory that followed on from their memorable 3-1 win over Bayern Munich.Ukrainian champions Shakhtar have made it to the knockout stages in Europe in each of the last eight seasons. That said, they have been knocked out at the first time of asking in seven of those seasons, with their run to the semi-finals in the Europa League in 2015-16 the only exception.As has been the case for years, they rely heavily on the input of a Brazilian contingent, though the current crop do not possess the quality of Fernandinho, Willian or Douglas Costa. Taison is the standout star in the squad but both he and top scorer Moraes are now 31.Shakhtar’s opponents, on the other hand, have a youthful exuberance to their attack. One of only two teams to progress through the Europa League group phase with a perfect record, Frankfurt did so despite facing Lazio and Marseille, two of last season’s semi-finalists. The Bundesliga side have not missed former coach Niko Kovac since his appointment at Bayern. His replacement, Adi Hutter, has enjoyed a fantastic start to life in Germany, having previously won titles with Salzburg and, last season, with Young Boys, ending their 32-year wait to win the Swiss league.• Visit WhoScored for more statistics and ratings• Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea4d23dad0937ecd2ee8991215b8550a5e5baad/913_0_2927_1756/master/2927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8fcb2e02e6cfb0ef5a0aa3c21e93e5e","title":"crackdown 3 review pc xbox one sumo digital microsoft","story":"PC, Xbox One Sumo DigitalMicrosoftThis simple action caper where players liberate a neon-clad city from a sinister megacorp makes 15 hours disappear easilyA capsule comic-book power fantasy, Crackdown 3 is a colourful, uncomplicated action caper through a vaguely Tron-like futuristic city that you, a special agent with superpowers, must liberate from a sinister megacorp. At the beginning, you’re mostly waving pistols and machine-guns in the faces of the city’s militia and getting instantly wiped out whenever you stray into more heavily armed districts. Hours later, you’re chucking cars at groups of soldiers, leaping over tall buildings like a buff flea, and blowing up factories with ease. The whole thing can be played co-operatively with a friend, flattening the odds even further by throwing two superpowered agents into the fray.TerraNova is an unoriginal but pretty neon-clad city of skyscrapers and slums, airborne highways that wind confusingly between its districts, and holographic propaganda projections that issue platitudes from the rooftops. It’s an interesting and varied place to run around, home to clustered shanty towns lining the perimeter of an industrial quarry, well-to-do areas with gated residences and ostentatious nightclubs, and an unexpectedly huge raceway. Hundreds of tantalisingly glowing, ability-enhancing orbs are dotted liberally around the place, encouraging you to investigate its nooks and crannies and climb its towering buildings.As your superhuman powers level up, so, too, does your dominance over the place. Liberated prisons, conquered metro stations and sabotaged factories become your territory. Shotguns, incendiary grenades and machine-pistols make way for laser beams, cluster missiles and rocket launchers with names like “The Decimator”. The city throws more and more bodies, armoured cars and robots at you as you become more powerful, culminating in a ceaseless assault on the corporate towers at its centre. Over-the-top does not begin to cover it.It’s all good fun, slipping down as easily as a Saturday-evening action flick, but it’s also strangely flimsy. It never feels as if your character fully connects with anything. Cars slide around the road as you drive them climbing is finicky and hit-and-miss there’s a voluminous arsenal of weapons, but they all feel like overpowered Nerf guns, as targets crumple and ping about under your assaults. Buildings are disappointingly impervious to the copious explosions and ceaseless gunfire, which led me into comical situations where I would hide from a gunship bombardment under a parking complex ramp, popping out to fire off a few homing missiles whenever I could see through the smoke.Crackdown 3’s script veers between sweary, earnest railing against neo-capitalist corporate dominance and nonsensical action quips (“Hot lead: good for justice, bad for your health!”), so you’re never quite sure how seriously it takes itself. Really, it’s the kind of game that’s best enjoyed when you don’t think about it very hard. It’ll make 12-15 hours disappear in an ever-escalating sequence of rooftop-ning leaps of faith, easily conquered shootouts and cartoonish face-offs against supervillains and giant robots. It’s as moreish as popcorn, and exactly as substantial. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

We’re looking to explore questions around the idea and gather your perspectives for an upcoming article.In September, the head of the TUC said advances in technology mean that a four-day week working week is a realistic goal for most people by the end of this century. “We can win a four-day working week, with decent pay for everyone,” Frances O’Grady said. But is that really attainable? And should this be the focus of how we change the way we work?Several readers with experience of the policy reacted to a related opinion piece by saying that they were happier working four day weeks, with one saying the move was “one of the best decisions I have ever made. I recommend it to everybody.” Others said they wished their companies would take the idea more seriously, but there were mixed views on how best it can be implemented.We would like to hear more of your views and experiences on four day working weeks, whether or not you are an employee or an employer at a company or organisation implementing or exploring the idea.Whatever your experience or opinions, tell us about them in the form below.

You would have been a fool to bet against her original shtick being huge in 2002. An era in which Busted bestrode teenage affections like a tri-headed, invariably gurning colossus was clearly ripe for a Canadian teen dressed as a schoolgirl, sticking her tongue out, doing devil-horn fingers and peddling battery-farmed pop-punk aimed squarely at teens. And it was huge: her debut album Let Go sold 16m copies. Equally, however, you would have been brave to bet on Avril Lavigne hanging around. You could marvel at the precision-tooling that went into Sk8er Boi without thinking it was necessarily the stuff on which protracted careers were founded. A gap in the market had been identified and exploited, a great deal of money made, and its audience were bound to grow up and move on, right?Wrong. Seventeen years on from Let Go and here we are, staring down the barrel of Lavigne’s sixth album. How has she survived, even flourished, when the careers of most 2002 teen sensations – and indeed the pop-punk bands that provided her initial inspiration – have withered? In the interim, certain adjustments have been made. Her albums now sell only in vast quantities, rather than figures that make you think there’s been a misprint. Her image has shifted. You can’t go on dressing like a schoolgirl and sticking your tongue out indefinitely, although Lavigne kept at it longer than you might imagine, bolstered by her 2007 single Girlfriend, a Chinn and Chapman-esque burst of bubblegum so brilliant it would have been a huge hit at any point in the last 50 years. By contrast, Head Above Water arrives with a cover that offers us Avril Lavigne, serious singer-songwriter, naked but for an acoustic guitar, a stock signifier of unvarnished honesty that, for some inexplicable reason, male singer-songwriters are never impelled to use to prove their sincerity.In a sense, this approach returns Lavigne to her roots. Like a millennial equivalent of Gryphon, the medievally inclined prog band whose members ditched their crumhorns and regrouped as the Banned when punk hit, she was originally signed as a country-ish singer-songwriter, before someone noticed that Blink-182 were selling millions. Head Above Water’s title track, meanwhile, has been a big hit on US Christian radio, hailed as a powerful worship ballad: Lavigne’s career began with her performing alongside a Christian singer called Stephen Medd.The reviewers at Faithwire and Christian Headlines have a point. Head Above Water is powerful, in a big old MOR power-ballad way. In fact, what the yanks call adult contemporary is very much the album’s most successful mode: it’s at its best when Lavigne and her co-writers forget about trends and roll out the booming drums and the kind of air-punching choruses you could imagine Heart singing in their garagantuan-haired 80s heyday. No one is ever going to describe the results as hip, but It Was in Me and Warrior are ruthlessly well-written, they fit Lavigne’s voice and the soldier-on lyrical sentiment is given a little edge by the album’s backstory. Head Above Water was inspired by Lavigne’s battle with Lyme disease, the tick-bourne infection to which she succumbed shortly after her 30th birthday and, she has said, nearly killed her.It’s on substantially shakier ground when it tries to apply the pragmatic thinking that led Lavigne to co-opt pop-punk to what’s in vogue today. The sentiment behind Dumb Blonde – female empowerment anthemics featuring a guest appearance from Nicki Minaj and a guitar part that sounds like Stevie Nicks’ Edge of Seventeen – is inarguable, but it feels flat and rote. You could point out that Lavigne’s brand of empowerment doesn’t seem terribly empowering, relying as it does on reinforcing a lot of grim stereotypes about other women being dumb blonds and “stupid Barbie dolls”, but it hardly seems worth it clearly no one involved in its manufacture considered the song that carefully. The problem with the album’s dabblings in chart pop à la Taylor Swift (Souvenir, Goddess, Bigger Wow) and post-Amy Winehouse retro-soul (Tell Me It’s Over) isn’t that the songs are poor, or that Lavigne can’t manage the stylistic shifts. It’s more that she doesn’t impose herself on them – they could be by anyone. You struggle to identify exactly what she’s bringing to the party beyond a knowledge of which way the commercial wind is blowing.The end result isn’t bad, but it is uneven. For all the talk of Lavigne finally writing her life and telling her story it’s hard not to come away thinking that her heart lies more with the power ballads than the lunges for commercial contemporaneity. They are the songs that hit hardest and stick around. Still, the other stuff has its role to play, not least in answering our initial question. Why is Avril Lavigne still here? Perhaps because she’s more adaptable.Unknown artist: Shelved Recordings #1Two 12-ins in a generic sleeve with no track titles or details at all turn out to be luscious re-edits of obscure 80s pop tracks, smooth and weird in equal measure.

And yeah, I hope you enjoy the new album, if you\u0027re going to buy it.UncleZippy asks: Why are you either so self-deprecating or comically cocky about your work? Did you grow up feeling ashamed about being creative?No, I grew up having no confidence whatsover in my abilities. I had confidence in my ideas but not my abilities. But also, I don\u0027t want to brag about it, I don\u0027t want to appear overly confident about it - I think that\u0027s really offputting.You went to stage school. Can you tell us about that?I did Theatre Studies at A level. I tried to get into Rada, the lot, any that would have me, but I couldn\u0027t get in. I spent a year doing auditions, and I realised it would take another two or three years to get any kind of result –\u0026nbspso I went into music instead.Did you ever visit the old Robin Hood visitor centre in Nottingham? I went in there tripping on shrooms and the papier mache headed Middle Ages blokes sat round in the tavern will last with me forever.No I don\u0027t, no. I\u0027ve never gone in. But that must have been amazing.Would you take on a sponsor for live shows if it meant you could put on the whole lighting rig stuff and video wallsvisuals, or are the crates and laptop a part of your signature?Yeah., we\u0027re not really into visuals. They look terrible. And to be honest I don\u0027t know why other bands haven\u0027t caught onto the idea of not using them. Even having your name behind you is a no-no. The music should carry itself. And I understand that a lot of bands\u0027 music isn\u0027t carried very well, so they need all the help they can get. But we are looking into lighting ideas - people are saying a minimal lighting show could add a nice touch to it. But big stage shows, stupid, they really do take away from it.You’ve not put a foot wrong these last few years – how do you keep pushing forward in such a consistent manner? Admittedly, the utter shitshow we have to endure gives you loads of material, but isn’t that true for every band?Bands have got different agendas, it just so happens that ours is... I don\u0027t know! You can\u0027t put it into words. But it\u0027s nice you think that. A lot of people don\u0027t. It\u0027s loads of different things that have made it what it is.Who cut your hair, the council?Who cut my hair, the council? No. And I\u0027ve not got that haircut any more - the straight fringe is a young person\u0027s game. It\u0027s not something I want to carry into my 50s - it would look like a toupee. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with toupees. I just thought I\u0027d get rid of it.MYCohen asks:1. How important is money?2. What’s your favourite Fall track?How important is money? Of course it\u0027s important. I\u0027ve got a mortgage to pay and we need to eat, and because of that it\u0027s important. If you\u0027re talking about a gig being attractive for a lot of money, it depends - we do a lot of gigs where we don\u0027t earn a lot, and it\u0027s nice to be paid more than you usually do. Would I sell out for £2m quid? No I wouldn\u0027t. Well actually, it depends on the level of sell-out. But as a rule. NoThe Fall: Industrial Estate, I thought that was good. People compare us to them so much, so I don\u0027t listen to them too much in case we pick them up. But god rest his soul - he was a man who stuck to his formula and you\u0027ve got to respect that.Your music is so full of hate, have you ever thought of being constructive for a change? Perhaps sing about solutions, not your spite?No, we don\u0027t sing about solutions. I would find that really patronising. There is no answer. Life is chaotic the human form is chaotic. As Alan Moore once said, we\u0027re speeding towards a brick wall in a fast car. We\u0027re animals. There are no solutions. But this music isn\u0027t hate music at all. It\u0027s good street music. And on the street, it\u0027s never nice. Regular life for the most part is pretty crap, and this is what it talks about.How difficult has it been to keep reacting to events given how fast everything moves now?It hasn\u0027t really. You do an album, and you have a cooling off period, and you start again. And your idea of how you want to communicate that, connects to it. It\u0027s not majorly difficult, you just have to be honest with yourself brush by any notion of addressing something in a cliched or obvious way, and think about how you\u0027re going to propose a point on a stage that is powerful. So no. I\u0027ve got a lot of time to think about it, and after each year we\u0027re ready to start again. It marries itself to current issues, because current issues are still unbelievably bad, and will carry on like that.Hi, I’m a 21 year old that’s grown up poor in the depressing, expensive Tory heartland of Surrey. A lot of my mates are turning very right wing, regurgitating whatever they’ve read from social media, and the heavy lefties seem to be equally shallow and militant. Any help? I can\u0027t give you any help, I\u0027m sorry. I just can\u0027t. What do you do? Just carry on. And try to question everything. It\u0027s interesting you have equal scorn for the left as the right, as that\u0027s how it\u0027s getting - people are just pulling things out of books and saying things for effect. But I don\u0027t have any answers for you, I\u0027m sorry.Do you envisage a time when Sleaford Mods will have run its course, or are you happy to be like the Rolling Stones?I dunno. Not sure. I think me and Andrew constantly think if its decent any more, but every time we record an album, it\u0027s good. It\u0027s not boring yet, but what can you do - I do worry about it a lot, but it\u0027s still good. And it\u0027s only really five years old in a commercial sense. I\u0027ve just got to ignore all that - it\u0027s moved on enough to justify carrying on. We certainly don\u0027t repeat ourselves, and I like to think the subject matter, although it is largely talking about similar themes, is addressed differently on each album. There will come a time where we might feel slightly out of sync, but that hasn\u0027t happened yet. It depends how we play it. The main thing is that we\u0027re honest with ourselves. We\u0027re still really happy with it. It\u0027s bulletproof.Jason, you gave up alcohol a couple of years back. You’ve mentioned that this has helped you get in physical shape. But did it affect your creativity – is writing lyrics harder now? No, it\u0027s easier. Because I haven\u0027t got drug comedowns and hangovers to deal with, I haven\u0027t got guilt to deal with, any what did I do? stuff to deal with. I\u0027m not arguing as much, I\u0027m not paranoid, and every day is nice. I get up and I\u0027m alright. So it\u0027s easier to write stuff and motivate yourself - previously I was languishing in self-pity and utter confusion.How hard is to keep the lyrics real in this time of political correctness when everybody’s so easily offended?Well, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re overtly offensive, apart from swear words and criticism of whoever. I\u0027m sure most of the lyrics get laughed off by whatever target, it\u0027s how it is isn\u0027t it? There\u0027s far more offensive bands to be looking at really, who do keep well within the realms of political correctness. It\u0027s easy - just carry on.Why were you supporting the Who at Hyde Park a few years back? Someone thought you were a mod band perhaps?No - the promoter of the festival was someone who really liked us and asked us to come along. And to be honest, if there was ever a band that was tied in with the idea of it, it would be us - I\u0027ll take that, thank you very much!D’you reckon the Brits are rigged? Or just shit?They\u0027re not rigged - they just don\u0027t let bands in who the label sponsors don\u0027t have a financial interest in. So that\u0027s why it\u0027s not as interesting as it mildly was 25 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b347cbf0236da29cb3581d5e45fcc140fceb1de9/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d18844848b79d1be00a73e7e1c882fd","title":"a week at guantanamo bay today in focus podcast","story":"’s Julian Borger recently spent a week at the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, attending the 33rd pre-trial hearing of five 911 suspects.

It comes as the government is separately seeking to negotiate legally-binding changes to the Irish backstop, in order to persuade the Democratic Unionist party and Brexiter MPs to back the prime minister’s deal.May is due to meet with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in the same week, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told the Commons on Thursday.May has insisted to the EU that a time-limit on the backstop, a unilateral exit mechanism or its replacement with “alternative arrangements” would convince Brexiter MPs that the UK would not be trapped in the customs union envisaged to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.But the EU’s most senior officials have said in turn that the bloc will not reopen the withdrawal agreement.They have instead welcomed Corbyn’s recent offer to throw his party’s support behind the Brexit deal.When the European council president, Donald Tusk, directly suggested to May last week that Corbyn’s Brexit plan might be a way out of the deadlock, sources said May did not respond.The government, however, insists that while there was “a lot of common ground” with the Labour frontbench it would not support a future customs union.The EU’s belief that there is little hope of the government winning over the most hardline Brexiters and the DUP is likely to be strengthened on Thursday evening during a debate and vote on the next steps in the Brexit talks.May has asked the Commons to approve a motion that “reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January”.But Tory MPs in the Eurosceptic European Research Group, chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg, are threatening to rebel as the Commons had expressed both its support for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop and for no deal to be avoided.It has been reported that up to 50 Tory MPs could abstain or vote against the motion, delivering another defeat for the prime minister, and weakening even further the government’s argument that she can persuade Brexiters to back the deal.Earlier on Thursday, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, expressed the growing dismay in EU capitals about the Brexit talks, and claimed that the UK was a “waning country” and too small to stand alone on the global stage.A Downing Street spokesman hit back, claiming that employment was “at a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK. Deloitte named the UK as Europe’s leading destination for foreign direct investment just last month.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f98201e2ee8e84a3c4d18633de448516457612a/0_199_4639_2783/master/4639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c7112c3fa8e911c247b9a8639461b0c","title":"green party sian berry stand london mayoral election 2020","story":"Co-leader will take part in mayoral election in capital for second time in a rowThe Green party co-leader Siân Berry is to stand again as its candidate in the 2020 London mayoral election.Berry, a London assembly member and councillor, took over the joint leadership alongside Jonathan Bartley in September. She was the Greens’ candidate at the 2016 mayoral election, finishing third behind Labour’s Sadiq Khan and Zac Goldsmith of the Conservatives.She also stood for the post in 2008, coming fourth in the poll that first made Boris Johnson the London mayor.Khan, the current mayor, is standing again and is the clear favourite. His Conservative opponent this time is Shaun Bailey, who since being selected by the party has faced criticism over a series of previous comments he made about women and Muslims.Berry will put the city’s housing crisis at the centre of her campaign. In an address when she was named as the candidate, she announced plans for what the Greens are calling a “people’s land bank”, which would allow communities to bring empty buildings and land back into use.She said the Greens were the “only party Londoners can trust to deliver on their promises” regarding housing, pointing to the party’s campaigns in the capital against councils demolishing social housing estates.“The Green party has a proud history of getting results for London. When we make Londoners a promise, we deliver, and have made real changes even when we are not mayor,” she said.“In 2016, we promised to give power to residents whose homes faced demolition, and we delivered on that promise. Now we pledge to give Londoners a say on land use in their city.”The land bank would “empower communities to find land and buildings currently going to waste and choose how to bring it back into use”, Berry said.She added: “Across the capital, empty buildings like office blocks and car parks are left unused, while Londoners struggle to pay the rent or wait for years to get social housing. That isn’t right, and we have to start planning now for how we bring these underused spaces and empty land back into use.”She is also the Greens’ top choice on their list for London assembly members, who are elected under the additional member system, a form of proportional representation.In 2016, the Greens won two of the 25 seats, filled by Berry and Caroline Russell. Russell is also second on the list for the 2020 election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/060f96ba7af65212aa116a8f03e520cf0a599f3c/0_138_4934_2960/master/4934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d05267d79bae9328e6900ea52ebacd29","title":"project fur brexit is a big blue monster say the dutch","story":"Campaign depicts UK exit as an obstructive Muppet causing office annoyanceThe British government may still not have a clue what Brexit looks like, but the Dutch have a pretty good idea: it is a giant blue furry monster that sprawls annoyingly across your desk and stops you getting any work done.The Netherlands foreign minister, Stef Blok, tweeted a picture on Thursday of himself with the enormous Muppet-like creature lying in front of him in a white T-shirt emblazoned with the word “Brexit” in big red letters.“Have you checked what consequences Brexit has for you or your company?” asked Blok, his arms lifted in mock exasperation and a somewhat unconvincing look of frustration on his face. “Make sure Brexit doesn’t get – or lie – in your way.”The tweet also included a link to an official government site, brexitloket.nl, where Dutch companies can do a full “Brexit scan” of their business, calculate the impact on their bottom line and take steps to reduce the fallout.The Netherlands is among the best-prepared of all the EU27 for Brexit – particularly if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March – but the government has said it is still concerned too few Dutch businesses are fully aware of all it might entail.As part of a €100m (£88m) Brexit preparation programme, it launched a major public information campaign last month, including newspaper ads and rhyming radio jingles, warning businesses they could not afford to be taken by surprise and would have to be creative in their approach to likely problems.Products will probably be held up for longer at customs, UK-issued certificates and licences may no longer be valid and data transfers could be affected, warns the campaign. It will show the Brexit monster physically frustrating Dutch businesses by, for example, getting in the way of trucks and production lines.But the Dutch also stand to benefit: the European Medicines Agency has moved to Amsterdam from London, more than 40 companies, including Sony and Panasonic, are shifting their European HQs to the Dutch capital, and authorities say they are in talks with 250 others.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said in an interview with European newspapers including the Financial Times on Wednesday that Britain would be “diminished” by Brexit, adding a no-deal departure would be “devastating” and “insurmountable” for the British economy.“At the moment, the ball is rolling towards the Dover cliff and we are shouting ‘Stop the ball from rolling any further’, but nobody is doing anything at the moment, at least not on the UK side,” Rutte said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b6fa0e9fe3312bef9bdeb24b3d38eb44d2ed0c/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9187898fb91f541c1d46ceb0da251738","title":"dont use moisturiser and stop over exfoliating 10 beauty rules for your best ever skin","story":"Want to take your complexion to the next level? Three skin experts share their dos and don’ts for clear, glowing skinFeed your skinDid you know we all have our own skin flora? “Bacteria, yeast and viruses make up our skin microbiome,” says Pfeffer. “You want to foster and encourage your healthy microbiome to flourish and be at its most erse. By doing this, those microorganisms will protect your skin from infection, pollutants and pathogens which contribute to ageing, acne and eczema.”Pfeffer recommends using pH-balanced skincare, as anything too harsh, such as alcohol or soap, can destroy the bacteria. “Incorporate probiotics into your routine inside and out!” she adds.Ramp up your hydrationIt’s old news that drinking water is good for us, but did you know you can supercharge the hydration benefits of your H2O? “Drinking water is important, however, you may find you still feel dehydrated externally,” says Reynolds. Sound familiar? “Add ionic mineral drops to your water, as this will hydrate you at the cellular level. It is important for cell turnover and communication sometimes drinking water alone doesn’t cut it.”Take care of your productsDon’t just focus on looking after your complexion – your products need care too. “Active ingredients can be unstable and have an expiration date for a reason out-of-date products aren’t going to perform at their optimum and could even cause skin irritation,” says Pfeffer. “Check how the product should be stored, too – lots of ingredients can be denatured by sunlight so it’s best to keep them in a cool, dark cabinet. What if there’s a textural change or a funny smell? Play it safe and don’t apply.”Use retinol at night“Retinol is an anti-ageing superstar,” says Kerr. “It is a cell communicator that can attach to most skin cells, telling them to behave like younger, healthier versions of themselves.”Retinol is best used at night when the skin is “more active and in repair mode”, adds Kerr. Because retinol is a seriously active ingredient, start slow with a low percentage a few nights a week and work your way up in strength and frequency.Incorporate PHA into your routinePolyhydroxy acids (PHAs) are the new “it” exfoliating acid on the beauty block and because they are gentle, everyone can benefit from them (even if you have sensitive, dry or rosacea-prone skin). “PHAs are humectants, which means they have the ability to attract moisture which hydrates the skin. They also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits,” says Kerr. “Plus, if used regularly they can strengthen barrier function, making the skin stronger and more resilient, giving you more of that sought-after glow.”Stop applying products in the wrong orderYou need to think about product penetration when applying your skincare. “The biggest mistake I see people make is using a balm or oil cleanser, then applying a water-based serum. Water floats on top of oil – that serum isn’t going anywhere near your skin,” says Kerr. Apply your products from thinnest in consistency to thickest and “always apply sunscreen last”, adds Kerr.Stop over-exfoliatingSkin experts have differing views on this one, but Reynolds doesn’t believe we should be excessively exfoliating. “The skin’s microbiome and lipid barrier can be disrupted by aggressive exfoliating, leading to inflammation,” she says. Aim to exfoliate twice a week. If you feel your skin can handle more, that’s OK, but proceed with some caution.Stop using moisturiserCurveball! “It has been ingrained in us from a young age to cleanse, tone and moisturise. But our skin is capable of maintaining its own hydration levels – only a true dry skin type needs moisturiser,” says Kerr. “When we use moisturiser, our skin’s surface sends a signal down to its water reservoirs that there is plenty of moisture and to halt production. This makes the skin sluggish and lacking in moisture, so we reach for more moisturiser.“Breaking the cycle wakes up the skin’s natural moisturising processes, not only hydrating the skin but helping to balance oil production, preventing congestion. You’ll notice a brightening of the complexion and slower rate of skin ageing.” Give it a go and you should start to see a difference in two to three weeks.Stop ignoring instructions“The biggest mistake is overusing something if it works,” says Reynolds. If that retinol is making your skin glow, then the temptation is to go to town. “Remember, the ingredients in products that give the wow factor can also create an imbalance if over used. Stick to the instructions.”Stop cleansing with oilsBalm and oil cleansers may feel luxurious, but Kerr says “oils congest the skin, upset our own moisturising processes and prevent product penetration”. Not ready to give up your balm or oil cleanser? Be sure to double cleanse to remove any oil residue that could prevent your pricey serums from penetrating.Be your healthy best with Nature’s BountyBeauty starts from within.

From gardening ‘workouts’ to training with Serena Williams, there are ways to be frugal and fitIf getting fit is up there on your 2019 to-do list, then you may be tempted to stump up the cash for a pricey gym membership. Instead, why not explore the fitness workouts you can do for free?When it comes to getting fit, Louise Parker, author of Louise Parker: The 6 Week Programme (£20, Mitchell Beazley) and founder of the Louise Parker Method, believes the route to success is consistency, so, whether or not you’re paying for your workout, bear that in mind. “Stick to a routine, even if the time varies,” says Parker. “I get home, tend to the kids and then it’s yoga mat out for a quick cardio workout and job done. It’s not severe or gruelling, so I never dread it. It’s consistent and so it works.”Luke Worthington, human movement and elite performance specialist, agrees: “As a trainer, one of the most common questions I get asked is: ‘What’s the best programme for *insert goal here*?’ The answer, almost always, is the one that you will stick to. Adherence and consistency (and, therefore, motivation) are the most important considerations when embarking on an exercise regime.”Below are five free workout ideas. All you need to do is commit, workout, then repeat.Running is one of the most affordable ways to get fit. To start with, you really don’t need a lot of expensive kit a pair of running shoes – and, for women, a sports bra – is all you need to get started. If you’re totally new to running, try downloading the C25K 5K Trainer app (iTunes or Android, free), which will get you running the distance in just eight weeks. Once you’ve mastered a 5k, why not seek out your local Parkrun? The free Saturday morning race is timed, so you can keep track of your progress week after week.If you live near the countryside, or you fancy heading off for an active break, then why not seek out the UK’s best hiking routes? Walking is a low-impact exercise – you’re less likely to get injured from a jaunt across the countryside than doing something more intense. You’ll be burning calories and working those muscles, all the while distracted by the scenic views. Head to nationaltrailthe-trails to discover some of the best walking routes our country has to offer.We all know that gym memberships can cost an arm and a leg, and while there are now more affordable options that don’t tie you in, they still involve a monthly outlay. Our Parks offers free workouts, from boxfit and boot camps to yoga and Zumba, in parks up and down the country. Simply set up an online account and book a class near you.If you like the idea of being outside, but you’re not a fan of workout classes, then Green Gym could be for you. It’s a charity organisation that gets volunteers gardening their way to fitness. Each session involves a warm-up and cool down, but the bulk of the “workout” is gardening.Fitness Blender is a website devoted to free workouts of varying lengths and for different abilities – choose from barre, cardio and strength training, plus many more. It’s this decade’s answer to the workout DVD.If you travel a lot and want to exercise on the go, then download the Nike Training Club app (iTunes and Android, free) it’s essentially like having Nike’s best trainers and athletes – such as Serena Williams and Cristiano Ronaldo – in your pocket. It boasts more than 100 workouts, including core strength, abs and arms, and glute toner.Don’t think you have the willpower or motivation to work out at home? Anna Samuels, boxing trainer and the BoxxMethod co-founder suggests treating your at-home workout like you would a gym class or personal training session. “Book out time in your diary to do it, otherwise there is always the risk of putting it off until later. With the right mindset and planning, you will find the motivation to start, and with consistency it will become a habit.”OK, this is slightly unusual, but ecstatic dance – where you move to music in any way you please – frees you from confusing routines so you can lose yourself in the rhythm. You don’t need to head to a pricey class instead, load up Spotify or iTunes with your favourite, energy-boosting tunes and dance like no one’s watching. The benefits? It’s free, it burns calories and can even relieve stress.

He wanted to win The X Factor. “Do you sing?” I asked. “No,” he said. “But I’ve never cried before and I can only cry if I win The X Factor.

Afterwards a friend texted me on my Nokia brick to inform me something I needed to know about Nick. It turns out he wasn’t 13 at all – he was 12. Twelve! I felt lost, betrayed and humiliated. This Year 8 kid had lied to me and it was over. The experience taught me everything I now know about love: ask to see ID before going to the latest Star Wars instalment, or girl you gonna get burned.This date was disastrous thanks to me and only me. While at university, I fancied myself a real manic pixie dream girl – so when a lovely young man asked me out, I decided to inject it with as much whimsy as humanly possible. First, I demanded he drive us to a cemetery, because I wanted to be quirky but in a goth way. It turned out to be much sadder than the Smiths made it seem, so we got back into his car. After that, I asked him to drive us to a strip club. There, he tried his best to maintain eye contact with me as a beautiful woman approached us offering a lap dance. He politely said “I’m good”, to which the beautiful woman responded with a shrug: “I’m better.” Later we made out in his car.Once upon a time, there was a little, ginger, camp comedian who had just finished a Soho theatre run and was ready to find The One. He searched far and wide (OK, I went into Soho after my gig) and met a boy. He looked like Aladdin, we exchanged numbers. Days later, I was invited to his house (a warehouse in east London, and he was vegan – I should have known). The conversation was great, he was a little eccentric and wore a kimono but I just thought: “Take what you can get.” He took me into his “special room” and there was a bed of nails. He said they were for chiropractic – a likely story! I was dying to leave but the Uber surge charge was on. So I hopped on and I’ve not quite been the same since.When I was an awkward 18-year-old, all low self-esteem and Nirvana T-shirts, I met a friend of a friend in the pub. He had dark curly hair and lovely eyes, so when he asked me to go out with him, I was over the moon. I gave him my number (by which I mean the landline at my mum’s house) and steeled myself for a week of sitting by a phone that never rang. But it did. The next day. He was having a party at his house on Saturday night. Would I like to go along as his date? He lived in a village out of town so would come and pick me up. (He had a car! OK, it was his mum’s Nissan Micra, but it was a car!) I was so excited – a date and a house party. We made awkward small talk as he drove me to his parents’ house in the country. I thought: how cool must your parents be to just let you have a party in their massive house? We arrived, and I was greeted at the front door by said parents. Both of them. It was their 25th-anniversary party, where I was to be paraded and introduced to his entire family. I couldn’t escape – I didn’t even know where I was – so I had to smile sweetly and wait for him to drive me home.Never date someone older than your dad. Never date a drug addict. Never date someone you meet in a lift. These were the golden rules my mum told me. I broke all of them two years ago. He told me “You make me feel impossible” and quoted a Stephen King book at me. I assumed it was true love. We arranged to meet at 7pm. He was 45 minutes late. He told me he had been stopping a fight. This turned out to be a lie. He had gone to the cinema on his own to see Paddington and got the timings wrong. He wore Crocs, army shorts and a Robbie Williams Let Me Entertain You tour T-shirt. It was a Friday in December. He resembled a serial killer from Luther.We went to a hipster restaurant where he talked about his brother’s orce, his dead relatives and his acute IBS – all while taking out a lot of aggression on the bread sticks. After he asked if I had “ever considered getting checked for Marfan syndrome”, I stood to make a dignified exit. Instead, I banged my head on a decorative shelf and started bleeding from my head. As I bled all over my dress, the table, the food and my dignity, much like Sissy Spacek in Carrie, I also managed to bleed on his clothes. I apologised. He said there was nothing to apologise for. A week later he sent me a receipt for the dry cleaning.I was 15 and my boyfriend and I were in a posh spa for Valentine’s day. After some heavy petting in the deep end, I needed a widdle and because it was a nice place, I thought I would use the toilet. I sauntered off as sassily as I could in my mum’s ill-fitting Aztec-print bikini, through a door up some stairs. I was following my nose to the toilet because, like a fox (or rat), I work on instinct. I opened a fire door, which locked closed behind me and I took in my surroundings. I was in a five-star restaurant where people were busy eating Sunday lunch. There I was stuck like a fox (or rat) in the headlights: a dripping-wet, apologetic, bikini-clad rat. I did the walk of shame through to the other end of the restaurant, out the front door and back into reception. Hiya!When we first met, my girlfriend was living in Bristol. Early in our relationship, we walked to the beautiful suburb of Clifton for lunch it was all dappled sunlight and gentle breeze. Things were going tremendously well until the end of the meal, when my face and hands began dramatically swelling. My breathing was normal, I was merely beginning to inflate like Violet Beauregarde (but still brown). Once we had acquired deflationary drugs, detective work was in order. It turned out that the multivitamins I had started taking contained small amounts of krill oil. It also turns out that I am allergic to krill. Like a shit whale. If you want a date to go perfectly, avoid spending the preceding week microdosing yourself with poison while telling anyone who’ll listen that you’re “on a health kick”.We were just winding up the date when he broke his arm. My friend had arranged a blind date for me with her work colleague. There had been no spark of romance, I had to foot the whole bill and he told me I looked fatter in real life than on TV. We were just about to part ways (reasonably) amicably at the tube when he decided to vault over the barrier. The tube staff were really kind and sympathetic considering he was a felon, and called an ambulance. They assumed we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I felt obliged to go with him. I stayed with him for five hours in A\u0026ampE until he was discharged. I would love to be a time traveller so I could go back to 2002 and tell my younger self to leave before coffee.When I was 18 I had an all-consuming crush on a boy who was also a very close pal. We were already very comfortable talking about romantic relationships, just never the one we were clearly meant to have. I decided I had to tell him and invited him over to my place. I went to make us some tea and returned with two mugs on a tray. As he took a mug, I said: “I really, really like you.” The mug stopped in mid-air. Wordlessly, eyes glued to the mug, he replaced it on the tray, turned on his heel and walked out the front door. Summer holidays started the next day. I didn’t see him again until we were 24 and he was a last-minute passenger in a car I was driving on a road trip. But that’s another story.Did You Hear About the Morgans? Not a question. That’s the name of the film I saw when I was ditched halfway through a date. I was 18 and on one of my first ever romantic outings. My date (let’s call him Liam … like his parents did) invited me to see it. I was on my best behaviour. I don’t even think we spoke that much but I thought everything was going great. Then the film started … Sarah Jessica Parker attempted a character that wasn’t Carrie Bradshaw and “Liam” (real name) had to go to the bathroom. It was the longest bathroom break ever because it’s still going, apparently.I came of age in the 90s. Back then, you just fell on someone in a nightclub. Dating came later. I joined a dating website a couple of years ago and got chatting to a nice woman. She was quite a bit younger than me but happy to come to my local. When I arrived, she had pushed two armchairs together and had bought not one, but two bottles of wine. I had to be up for the school run. After a few minutes she said: “You snogged my cousin at the Edinburgh festival’ ARGH! Obviously, her cousin did not respect the law of “what happens at the fringe, stays at the fringe”. At Edinburgh, I’m 90s-me again. All other times, I’m a tired fortysomething. There was no second date.I used to watch people go on dates on Sex and the City and think: what are they doing? I didn’t have that sort of life. I used to sleep with people and work backwards: if you can tolerate them in the morning, you might get towards a relationship. I thought dates were like auditions, and I went on those and they were shit. But there was a time when I’d been single for a while so I appealed to a friend to set me up on a blind date. We had a nice evening, he was funny and interesting, but there wasn’t any spark. He was a playwright and was doing a production and offered me a part in it. I ended up snogging one of the other cast members and taking him home with me. He’s now my husband."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d91b8e58e548001a3044d0b651a9b0eea2ff7fa/0_104_4382_2630/master/4382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=315a741db159bce278ea20b01f3d5517","title":"alan partridge bbc brexit steve coogan","story":"Norwich’s finest is back on the BBC. His shambling persona is perfect for our political moment, says Steve CooganLast time Alan Partridge hosted a primetime BBC show, he was sacked live on air for punching his boss in the face with a turkey. Now that the world has “realigned itself along Alan lines”, Norfolk’s most famous radio DJ returns from years in the wilderness with This Time with Alan Partridge.Steve Coogan said it “feels right” for his character to return now, particularly given Brexit: “There might be a missive at the BBC saying that a certain area of the viewing audience had been disenfranchised … Alan potentially represents that. You can imagine them thinking we might as well give this guy another bite of the cherry.”In an act of arch self-satire that rivals its own W1A, the BBC has brought Partridge back to front a live One Show-style magazine programme. Partridge becomes the stand-in presenter after the beloved host falls ill. “He didn’t want to be back at the BBC,” said Coogan, “but when an opportunity presents itself, he had to jump at it.”His creation has morphed over 25 years from “unreconstructed, uber-Conservative little Englander” to a more nuanced figure. “Now he’s a bit more like David Cameron. He’s economically conservative but he understands you’ve got to be socially liberal. He tries to embrace things and tries to be ‘on message’ … but he’s not really.”The humour has moved beyond just mocking people who are intolerant. “It’s funnier to go for people who are attempting to adopt what is known as correct thinking and not quite getting it right.” Today’s woke world is rich pickings for Partridge: “He does try to be in tune with the zeitgeist. You don’t feel like you’re flogging a dead horse because you can adapt him to the times and his attitudes will adapt.”Originally created by Coogan with Armando Iannucci and Patrick Marber for the Radio 4 comedy On the Hour in 1991, Partridge has become one of the most popular comedy characters of all time, with shows including I’m Alan Partridge and Knowing Me, Knowing You. More recently, Coogan has worked with the writers Neil and Rob Gibbons on the film Alpha Papa and spoof memoirs I, Partridge and Nomad, as well as defecting to Sky with shows such as Mid Morning Matters and Scissored Isle.In fact, Partridge is so familiar to fans the production can essentially rest on its laurels. “You can just remove all the comedy and have Alan looking seriously at the camera,” said Neil Gibbons, and be left with nothing more than “the anticipation of what he’s going to do.”The magazine show format lets viewers see Partridge’s rambles during live takes, as well as between-takes shots of his ego being soothed by Lynn, his long-suffering assistant. It also features Partridgean tirades on everything from hand hygiene (leading him to lurk outside the BBC toilets doing spot-checks on colleagues) to hacking.There was one distinct problem of putting him in that setup, though, said Gibbons: “In the early days of Alan, there was a tightrope he was walking because there was an expectation of professionalism. If someone fluffed a line or got someone’s name wrong or said something stupid, it was mortifying. But nowadays, those are the sort of people who are given jobs on TV.”He likened Partridge to presenters such as Piers Morgan. “The producers of Good Morning Britain are not tearing their hair out thinking: ‘I wish he’d stop saying something offensive.’ They’re thinking: ‘That’s why he’s on the show.’ We had to ignore that, because if you put Alan in a world where his crass buffoonery is part of the selling point, there’s nowhere for him to fall.”This Time with Alan Partridge starts on BBC One on 25 February at 9.30pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ff769707fad257f9aacb112491702d8390783d/0_41_2763_1658/master/2763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=561bdfa0936003b2323e5b93fac554e4","title":"dutch pm on brexit uk waning country too small stand alone mark rutte","story":"Mark Rutte gives withering verdict as he warns against ‘devastating’ no-deal scenarioBritain is a “waning country” and too small to stand alone on the world stage, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has claimed in a withering assessment of the UK’s exit from the EU.Rutte, who has emerged as a key player in the talks over the past two years, also warned in an interview that the UK looked to be sliding off the “precipice” towards a “devastating” no-deal Brexit.“Who will be left weakened by Brexit is the United Kingdom,” he said. “It is already weakening, it is a waning country compared to two or three years ago. It is going to become an economy of middling size in the Atlantic Ocean. It is neither the US nor the EU. It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own.”Rutte, who also claimed the Dutch would replace the UK in the bloc as the pre-eminent voice for free trade, has been regularly consulted by Theresa May on progress in the Brexit negotiations.The Netherlands is one of the EU member states that will be most affected by the barriers to trade that will emerge after the UK leaves the bloc, although it has been the beneficiary of some relocations by big businesses.Figures released last week by the Dutch investment agency revealed 42 companies had relocated to the Netherlands in 2018, citing Brexit as a reason, resulting in the movement of 1,923 jobs.Asked whether a Brexit deal was likely, Rutte said in an interview with European media outlets, including the Spanish newspaper El País: “My impression is that the ball is heading towards the precipice and everyone screams to stop, but nobody does anything to stop it, at least, from the British side.”He said of the Irish backstop, which has proven to be the most contentious of issues, that Brussels had no intention of trying to use it to trap Britain in a customs union with the EU.The backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the whole of the UK would share a customs territory, is to come into force should a future trade deal or alternative arrangement be unable to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.Rutte said: “Some British parliamentarians say that we want to trap them in a permanent limbo. But it is not true. The EU is interested in moving to the next phase as soon as possible and starting a new relationship with the United Kingdom.“But given May’s efforts to renegotiate the Irish safeguard, I do not know how this will end and if we can avoid a hard Brexit. It would be devastating for the UK.”Rutte was speaking after a speech in Zurich on Wednesday, in which he highlighted that the “chaos” of Brexit showed “there’s no such thing as splendid isolation”.UK MPs will debate the next steps in the Brexit talks later on Thursday. Theresa May has asked the Commons to approve a motion that “reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January”.Tory MPs in the Eurosceptic European Research Group, chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg, are threatening to rebel as the Commons had expressed both its support for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop and for no deal to be avoided.It has been reported that up to 50 Tory MPs could abstain or vote against the motion, delivering another defeat for the prime minister. A Labour amendment is also seeking to force the government to return to parliament by the end of the month to hold a vote on its Brexit plan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125796cf8e9bd61255b7ad5a7c7f7706bd65725f/20_27_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=610cbc53068dc3881a38eee571f47a03","title":"german economy just avoids recession but weaker exports take toll","story":"Europe’s largest economy recorded zero growth in the fourth quarter of 2018Germany narrowly avoided falling into recession in the second half of last year as weaker exports dragged Europe’s largest economy to stalling point during the final three months of 2018.Several economists had previously warned that Germany was on the brink of recession because of consecutive monthly declines in factory output, with the country suffering from weaker levels of global demand and disruption at factories.Tensions between the US and China have acted as a handbrake on global goods trade, while growth is slowing in the Chinese economy after years of rapid expansion. Sales of cars in China dropped last year for the first time in almost 30 years, affecting manufacturers across Europe.New vehicle emissions tests introduced after the VW emissions scandal have also caused disruption to factories across Europe, including in Britain. Manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of the Germany economy, about double the size of Britain’s industrial base.Analysts said that domestic demand in the German economy – predominantly from investment in construction and machinery as well as government spending – helped it to avoid recession.Growth in consumer spending was, however, subdued, while net exports were a severe drag on headline GDP growth.Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said there were some reasons to hope German GDP growth would recover at the start of 2019.“There may be a further pick-up in auto production as the emissions testing backlog is cleared and household real incomes should rise due to falling headline inflation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446bf777a6840d43aa958156669d7b479e6fe340/0_22_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f423772a5429e3eed046d49929129334","title":"sweden investigates ambassador china strange meetings","story":"Daughter of Swedish bookseller jailed in China says Anna Lindstedt set up meetings in StockholmSweden is investigating its ambassador to China after she was accused of orchestrating a bizarre series of meetings between the daughter of a Swedish bookseller jailed in China and businessmen who said they could help secure his release.The story is detailed in a blogpost by Angela Gui, the daughter of Gui Minhai, a Chinese-born Swedish bookseller who has disappeared twice and is currently held in Chinese custody.Gui Minhai was one of five Hong Kong-based booksellers – known for publishing sensational tomes on the private lives of China’s elite – who disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced in mainland China two years later.He was released in October 2017, but was arrested on a train to Beijing in January 2018 while travelling with two Swedish diplomats. He was reportedly en route to see a Swedish specialist over fears he had the neurological disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.Angela Gui, who is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, has been vocal about calling for her father’s release.In the Medium post, Gui details the “very strange experience”, alleging that she was contacted by Anna Lindstedt, Sweden’s ambassador to China, in mid-January and invited to Stockholm to hear about a “new approach” to her father’s case.Lindstedt returned to Stockholm on Wednesday to meet officials from the foreign affairs ministry, the Swedish embassy in Beijing told Associated Press by phone. Lindstedt is not under criminal investigation. The embassy declined to give further details, but a foreign ministry spokesman in Sweden confirmed that Lindstedt’s departure was related to meetings she arranged between Gui and the Chinese businessmen.“She didn’t explain very much, but said that there were some businessmen she thought could help, and that they wanted to meet me in Stockholm. She’d join too, and these were people she trusted, she reassured me,” wrote Gui.Gui said the meetings were held at a hotel lounge, which required keycard access. She was encouraged not to leave the suite, with the businessmen saying they needed her to “be around as much as possible”. She said she was even escorted to and from the bathroom.After several days, during which time Gui says she was offered a job at the Chinese embassy, Gui said she felt a growing sense of unease.“There was a lot of wine, a lot of people, and a lot of increasingly strange questions. But because Ambassador Lindstedt was present and seemingly supportive of whatever it was that was going on, I kept assuming that this had been initiated by the Swedish foreign ministry,” wrote Gui.She alleges the men told her that talks were underway with Beijing to secure her father’s release but that in order for them to succeed Gui must stop talking about the case and avoid media engagement because “‘the Chinese’ were very angry with me”.Gui says Lindstedt agreed to the plan and promised that if Gui’s father was released she would “go on Swedish television and speak of the bright future of Sweden-China relations”.Gui claims that the conversations took a nasty turn, with one man saying she had to trust him or she would never see her father again and that her refusal to cooperate could harm the ambassador’s career.“Ambassador Lindstedt added that China were adopting a new diplomatic line which meant that if activism and media coverage was to continue, China might ‘punish Sweden’,” wrote Gui.Gui said she rang the ministry of foreign affairs the following week and they told her they were unaware that these meetings had taken place and were not even aware Lindstedt was in the country.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Stockholm denied any involvement in the incident. “The embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Sweden would like to solemnly state that the Chinese side has never authorised and will not authorise anyone to engage with Gui Minhai’s daughter,” the spokesperson said. “China is a country of rule of law, and the result of the Gui Minhai case is to be decided by China’s law, instead of the so-called China’s representative claimed by Gui Minhai’s daughter or the press. We hope that some people will not try to gain publicity for themselves by making up a so-called China’s representative.”Gui concluded her post by saying she would continue to campaign for her father’s release: “I’m not going to be quiet in exchange for a visa and an arbitrary promise that my father ‘might’ be released. Threats, verbal abuse, bribes, or flattery won’t change that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f40b3a5769b2d97649f5f32a76a4ae55fee144f9/0_12_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4516c67e763bc91a5ce89fb5d68422ed","title":"us and israel say confrontation with iran needed for peace","story":"Vice-president tells event that EU mechanism to facilitate trade with Iran is ‘ill-advised’The US vice-president, Mike Pence, has sharply rebuked Washington’s European allies over their efforts to shield their businesses from US sanctions on Iran, as transatlantic tensions over US foreign policy were laid bare at a conference in Warsaw.A scheme the EU has set up to facilitate trade with Iran was “an effort to break American sanctions against Iran’s murderous revolutionary regime”, Pence said during a conference on the Middle East organised by the US in the Polish capital.“It is an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU and create still more distance between Europe and the United States,” he said.The Warsaw meeting was attended by more than 60 nations, but major European powers such as Germany and France, parties to the landmark 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, refused to send their top diplomats over fears that the summit was designed largely to build an alliance against Tehran.The US, by contrast, is represented by Pence, Mike Pompeo, Washington’s top diplomat, and Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and special aide on the Middle East. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu is also attending.The Obama administration eased US sanctions on Iran under the terms of the nuclear deal, but Trump reimposed them when he withdrew the US from the agreement last year.“You can’t achieve stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran. It’s just not possible,” Pompeo told reporters after his formal opening statement. “There are malign influences in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq,” he said, referring to groups Iran supports. “The three H’s: the Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah, these are real threats.”Netanyahu had earlier withdrawn a claim on his Twitter account, said to be the result of a mistranslation, that he was in Warsaw to discuss war with Iran.Netanyahu described the opening dinner at which he sat alongside senior officials from Arab Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, as a historical turning point. Many Arab states do not recognise Israel, and have not shared a diplomatic stage with the country since a Middle East peace conference in Madrid in 1991, but they have been driven together by their common fear of Iran.It remains to be seen how far the new alliance can extend to a combined approach to the Palestinian issue. It is expected Kushner will discuss his peace plan with Arab leaders in private as well as at a public session on the sidelines of the summit.Netanyahu has argued that the Arab world is open to normalised economic ties with Israel that are not dependent on a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.At the opening session, he sat next to Khaled Alyemany, the foreign minister of Yemen, and the two exchanged a brief smile. Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s Middle East envoy, said on Twitter that Alyemany offered his microphone to Netanyahu, whose own had broken. Netanyahu then joked it signalled a “new cooperation between Israel and Yemen”, Greenblatt said. Palestinian officials have condemned the summit.Netanyahu, who faces elections shortly, told reporters in Warsaw: “In a room of some 60 foreign ministers representative of dozens of governments, an Israeli prime minister and the foreign ministers of the leading Arab countries stood together and spoke with unusual force, clarity and unity against the common threat of the Iranian regime.“I think this marks a change and important understanding of what threatens our future, what we need to do to secure it, and the possibility that cooperation will extend beyond security in every realm of life.”Officials said Netanyahu spoke around the same table as senior officials of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, none of which have relations with Israel. The country only has diplomatic relations with two Arab states, neighbouring Egypt and Jordan.Pompeo’s call in his opening speech for a new era of cooperation in the Middle East will viewed with scepticism by EU leaders, who feel they were not consulted on the US decision to pull out of the Iran deal, or the planned withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria.The Iranian foreign minister, Javed Zarif, described the Warsaw conference as “dead on arrival” and another attempt by the US to pursue an unfounded obsession with Iran.A former US ambassador to Sweden, Azita Raji, also dismissed the event saying “conducting a lacklustre and rambling conference on the Middle East shows that it is amateur hour at the White House and is ultimately another blow to US prestige and leadership”.The Warsaw conference came as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, increasingly seen as a key player in the Middle East, hosted his Iranian and Turkish counterparts to discuss a final settlement in the Syrian civil war, including the presence of a large number of Islamist fighters in Idlib province.The three countries, particularly Turkey and Iran, do not agree on the final settlement in Syria, but have been uneasily cooperating to find a solution that does not betray their interests.Iran wants Turkey to agree that Syrian forces should be deployed along the border with Turkey, but there has also been a separate US discussion of an international force to assuage Kurdish fears of Turkish invasion once US forces depart.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that the leaders would also discuss forming a special committee tasked with drawing up a new postwar constitution for Syria. The composition of the committee, including the role of civil society has been in dispute for more than a year. The previous UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, admitted on his retirement in December he had not overcome mainly Syrian government objections to his vision for the committee’s membership."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3793889.1550150540!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"raw sewage from 86 000 people flows into irish waterways daily epa","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Water managing director Eamon Gallen: ‘We want to avoid people paying these charges not to enforce them.’  Raw sewage from the equivalent of 86,000 people is flowing into Irish waterways every day, a health threat the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says is not being dealt with quickly enough. In a submission to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, the EPA said on Thursday that more is needed to tackle waste water, one of the principal threats to Irish rivers, lakes and estuaries. “Ireland is not addressing the deficiencies in waste water treatment infrastructure at a fast enough pace and, consequently, our health is continually exposed to risk,” it said. The agency said the threat was a reflection of “a legacy of under-investment” in infrastructure. The most pressing needs, it said, are to eliminate untreated waste water and to ensure it does not cause pollution. The committee was told Ireland has suffered a 3 per cent decline in good water quality between 2016 and 2017 and a continuing long-term decline of high quality rivers. Most pollution is caused by excess nitrogen and phosphorus from human activity, primarily from farms and urban areas. At the same hearing, Irish Water said with drinking quality having been prioritised in recent years, the wastewater network is now in “extremely poor condition” and will require “many years and hundreds of millions of euro” to fix. In Cork harbour, 5,000 tonnes of untreated sewage is pumped into the sea every day, although this volume was halved last year. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government submission noted European Commission infringement actions have been taken against Ireland in relation to water quality generally, but that most urban wastewater treatment would be compliant by 2021. At one point in the meeting Solidarity-People Before Profit TD Mick Barry castigated the panel of eight men for not including a single female participant and asked each for a breakdown of women in senior management positions.Irish Water managing director Eamon Gallen said six of 12 senior managers are women. The EPA’s Dr Tom Ryan said two of its six executive board members, including its director general, are women. Feargal Ó Coigligh, assistant secretary at the Department of Housing, said three of seven assistant secretaries are women. Mr Barry said his point was not pedantic but that the situation “tells a story about what goes on in this place far too much”. He took issue with a “seating restriction” that necessitated Irish Water’s head of asset operations Katherine Walsh remain in a row behind the main committee panel. At Mr Barry’s request to address the imbalance, she pulled up a seat beside her colleagues. However, his frustration was not universally shared. Fine Gael Senator Martin Conway, who is visually impaired, told the panel he could easily ask them similar questions in the area of disability employment but would not do so. “It certainly isn’t appropriate to embarrass public servants who are just doing their job,” he said. Meanwhile, the committee heard that the level of forthcoming “excess water use” charges would be decided following a public consultation process due “shortly”. Responding to questions from Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin on excessive use and the cost of repairing leaks, Mr Gallen said Irish Water’s interest was conservation. “We certainly don’t want to be penalising elderly people for a leak inside their house they can’t repair,” he said. “We want to avoid people paying these charges not to enforce them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Netherlands\u0026rsquo foreign minister tweets photograph with creature sprawled across deskIncident happened at about 10am between the Cookstown and Tallaght Hospital stopsEnvironment agency criticises failure to tackle health threat problem quickly enoughEvery child in Dublin 24 area to receive one book every month until they are aged fiveGarda\u0026iacute said money was part of \u0026pound26.5m Northern Bank robbery in 2004This time last year country shivered ahead of big freezeLord Mayor of Dublin Nial Ring met mortgage debt demands on Clontarf houseStephen O\u0026rsquoConnor died after incident outside fast food outlet in Killorglin last SundayGarda\u0026iacute seize eight cars a day driven by unaccompanied learner driversAndrew Doan is accused of murdering Charles John McCarthy in Australia in 2017Minister insists huge progress made in recent years in provision of social homesRobbie Walsh had pleaded not guilty to murder of Karl Haugh (25) in August 2017Six-wheeled vehicle Opportunity was built to operate for just three monthsMan who was in the house not injured but considerable damage caused to sitting roomInterim committee would focus on whiplash and other soft-tissue injuriesEfforts to counter the threat have fuelled much experimentation and investigationArchitectural historian and astrophysicist pick up top academic accolades"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3792877.1550093716!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda%C3%AD seize eight cars a day driven by unaccompanied learner drivers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMotorists whose vehicles have been seized face court fines of up to €1,000 and release fees of €125 for the first day, and €35 for each additional day. File photograph: Bryan O’Brien Gardaí seized 377 vehicles driven by unaccompanied learner drivers in the first 50 days of new legislation, according to the latest statistics.From December 22nd until February 10th gardaí seized almost eight cars per day on average, from learner drivers who failed to obey the regulation requiring them to be accompanied by a driver who has held a licence for at least two years.While it was already an offence carrying up to four penalty points and a fine of €120 for learners to drive unaccompanied, last December gardaí acquired new powers known as the Clancy Amendment, which allow them to impound the vehicles of learner drivers caught breaking the rule.Motorists whose vehicles have been seized face court fines of up to €1,000 and release fees of €125 for the first day, and €35 for each additional day or part day.Where the vehicle’s owner claims the vehicle was taken by the unaccompanied driver without permission, the gardaí may institute an additional prosecution for theft against the learner.The amendment is named after mother and daughter Geraldine and Louise Clancy who were killed on December 22nd, 2015, when an unaccompanied learner driver lost control of her car in Co Cork.The Clancy family campaigned for the amendment and in recent weeks Noel Clancy, father of Louise and husband of Geraldine, has appeared on a new road-safety campaign describing how his wife and daughter were killed and how he misses them.Among the first of the vehicles to be seized under the Clancy amendment was a car which was stopped on the M8 southbound, near Fermoy, by the local roads policing unit, according to the Garda. The driver had been detected speeding, and it was discovered he was an unaccompanied learner driver.The level of vehicle seizures was described as “disappointing” but evidence of the need for the legislation, by a spokesman for the Road Safety Authority.‘A disgrace’However Kerry TD Michael Healy Rae described the numbers as “a disgrace”.Mr Healy Rae said young people were being criminalised because of the legislation and were not driving to flout the law, but because they had no other option to get to college or work. He said “politicians inside in the Dáil who voted to ban this told me privately that this is how they learned to drive themselves, it is the ultimate disgrace”.Garda sources said there appeared to be some overlap between offences with those who were not compliant with the Clancy amendment frequently being responsible for further infringements.In one such case, a youth stopped driving in south Dublin had no licence, tax or insurance and told gardaí he had bought the car for €90.One incident found a motorist who was stopped because of a faulty rear light was in fact an unaccompanied learner driver who had taken off the car’s L-plates before driving.In another case, an unaccompanied learner driver failed a roadside breath test and was found to be over the legal alcohol limit.A learner motorist was detected in Co Kildare travelling at 115kmhr in a 50kmhr zone, while driving unaccompanied."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3793711.1550141018!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"festivals marts creches closing due to rising insurance d%C3%A1il told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Ireland is an outlier’ in personal injury awards compared to other countries, Dara Calleary said.

We now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. File photograph: Sebastian WillnowAFPGetty ImagesWhen you imagine a Neanderthal you probably think of the classic image of the “cave man”: heavy brow, monkey-like face, stooping posture, shaggy hair, holding a big club. Although this is not how most scientists imagine Neanderthals today (have a look at http:www.nhm.ac.ukdiscoverwho-were-the-neanderthals.html), the early images were based on observed characteristics of Neanderthal skeletal remains. An Irish-based scientist, the geologist William King, had an important role in interpreting these remains and even provided the name Homo neanderthalensis to express his belief that they were the remains of a new species of hominid similar to, but distinct from, modern humans.The position of Neanderthals in the ancestral tree of Homo sapiens has been a subject of debate since the first skull was discovered in Germany in 1856. Since then, fragments of more than 500 iniduals have been discovered. Scientists have asked questions about Neanderthal language and cognition, about Neanderthal tools, about Neanderthal burial practices and beliefs. Perhaps the most furious debate has concerned their relationship to fully modern humans. After the Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010, the debate has focused on how much interbreeding occurred between communities of Neanderthals and of Homo sapiens in Europe. In short, what percentage of our DNA did we get from Neanderthals? Before genome sequencing, scientists could only use their knowledge of comparative anatomy to determine the relationship between fossilised remains and living organisms. Using a cast of a skull cap and the descriptions of other Neanderthal skeletal remains written by other scientists, King asserted that the remains found in the Neander valley were different enough from modern humans to form a new species.King, originally from Sunderland, had been appointed a professor of geology at one of the newly opened Queen’s Colleges in 1849. The controversial “non-denominational” colleges were the precursors of NUI Galway, University College Cork and Queen’s University Belfast and aimed to increase the opportunities for Ireland’s middle classes to access higher education. The colleges were particularly forward thinking in their focus on scientific instruction. Isolated in Galway with few students but with a good laboratory and access to the ever-increasing scientific periodical press, King ranged widely across many sciences we might now consider separate. Most geologists today would think twice about debating the comparative anatomy of modern humans, chimpanzees and ancient remains. Yet when King obtained a cast of the unusual German skull cap, he compared it with a variety of other skulls (using both a collection of objects and descriptions in scientific papers) and concluded that the skull was so different from modern humans as to constitute a new species. Before King’s contribution, the predominant view was that the Neanderthal might be a deformed or diseased human. King dismissed this idea with the suggestion that even the most degraded and “inferior” human races (as King believed races other than Europeans to be) showed a more spherical skull and a higher forehead than the Neanderthal skull cap suggested. During the 19th century, a high forehead was believed to indicate superior intelligence. Australian Aborigines were most Europeans’ favourite example of a supposedly “degraded” and “savage” race and King believed that even their skulls showed more similarity to modern humans than the Neanderthal skull. In short, the Neanderthal skull’s “strong simial tendencies” led King to believe that it was simply too different from humans to be of the same species. In his 1864 paper for the Quarterly Journal of Science he even proposed in a foonote that “I now feel strongly inclined to believe that it is not only specifically but generically distinct from Man”. That is, not a member of the genus Homo. It is hard for us to recapture the shock value of King’s ideas in asserting the existence of another species of human-like creatures at a time when the Biblical version of creation was widely considered an accurate description of the Earth’s history.Things have come almost full circle from King’s time: we now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. Yet what has remained curiously consistent is our belief that Neanderthals were inferior to modern humans, although the explanations have changed. Rather than the absence of a high forehead, scientists now refer to the absence of some kind of genetic adaptation that enabled Homo sapiens to create more advanced societies and out-compete their shorter, stockier neighbours.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3792834.1550083910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"when it comes to 2020 don t count out the moderate democrats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Kamala Harris    –  already living down her past as a prosecuting attorney. Photograph: Win McNameeGetty At some point, any able-bodied Democrat who does not run for US president will have searching questions to answer about their self-esteem.Declared and probable candidates for 2020 are well into the double figures. Senator Kamala Harris has even reached the excruciatingly titled memoir-manifesto stage, with The Truths We Hold and, for lucky children, Superheroes are Everywhere.Surveying this erse, jostling field, many commentators say the party’s future is left wing. Radicalised in opposition to president Donald Trump, activists are demanding universal healthcare\u0026nbspthe abolition of current immigration enforcement and\u0026nbspthrough a Green New Deal, the rapid decarbonisation of the US economy.The centre is clean out of morale and, after Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016,\u0026nbspelectoral credibility, too. When Trump decried “socialism” in his State of the Union address, he was inadvertently flattering the left’s current momentum.Trump has made some Democrats ravenous for an equal and opposite reaction to him. But he has made many more just itch to defeat him, whatever the means. A Monmouth University survey has found that 56 per cent of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents favour an electable candidate over an ideologically sympathetic one. Just 33 per cent prefer the inverse. The gap is even larger among women. Polling director Patrick Murray says this preference is untypical in primary races within either party.If this win-at-all-costs discipline seems easy to promise\u0026nbspand harder to practise, remember that it has already been tested. In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats could have promised Trump’s impeachment or a battery of green taxes or kinder treatment of immigrants. Instead, they hardly strayed from a narrow, exhaustively poll-tested message about healthcare. The result was a handsome victory.What if the party really were as radical as the hype around a few of its congressional newcomers suggests? A moderate would still have grounds for hope.A candidate who runs as a progressive faces a gauntlet of purity tests. It is the nature of purity that no actual human possesses it. Candidates end up debasing themselves in a futile quest to establish their political pristineness. Harris is already living down her past as a prosecuting attorney, which some liberals cite as proof of latent authoritarianism. Another senator, Elizabeth Warren, has apologised for once registering as “American Indian”, lest anyone think a white-looking woman was claiming victimhood. A third, Kirsten Gillibrand, is accused of coming to the left conveniently late.Even to recite these stories is to feel sorry for the candidates. But it was their choice to pitch to the left, whose tendency to eat its own has never been a tightly guarded secret.A moderate can hope to evade these tests altogether. By never claiming to be all that radical in the first place, any pragmatic compromises on their record are unworthy of censure, or even comment. Klobuchar is some way to the left of a 1990s New Democrat. But it is well known that she gets on with Republicans and only goes so far on universal healthcare.Such accommodations with reality are the point of her candidacy, not a stain to be explained away. Activists may still balk, but they cannot put her through the kind of ideological invigilation that leaves the subject looking shifty, hypocritical and pandering. Dissenting from the base confers a perverse kind of staying power.The Democrats’ leftward turn is a story that has outstripped the available evidence. Some of it is wishful Republican thinking. Some of it is the media’s enchantment with novelty. But just three months ago, the Democrats won suburban votes by the bushel with a risk-averse, even drab campaign. The lesson is not entirely lost on the party. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"exorcisms thelutheran intercessors nigeria pictures","story":"Comment: The Left think it\u0026#39s rebellious to hate Churchill, but it just shows how little they understand BritainExeter murders: Police rule out OAP victims were shot dead as it emerges shotgun was found near one body‘They thought it was contagious’: Teenage mothers at risk from postnatal depressionBrexit vote: What are MPs voting on today, and how will it affect the deal?Brexit latest news: Theresa May risks fresh Brexit humiliation as Tory Brexiteers threaten revolt over Government motion   Shocking range of plastic found in loggerhead turtle that died on an Italian beachIsil schoolgirl Shamima Begum \u0026#39will not be rescued\u0026#39, as Security Minister warns \u0026#39actions have consequences\u0026#39Theresa May condemns John McDonnell for calling Winston Churchill a \u0026#39villain\u0026#39 as shadow chancellor repeats criticismComment: A \u0026#39Manchester Round\u0026#39 of global talks would show Britain is still the home of free tradeValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Who was St Valentine and what is the true meaning behind February 14?Australian senator apologises for wiping blood on ex-leader\u0026#39s door after parliament brawlPrince Harry says rugby changes lives during Q\u0026ampA with England Rugby union co-captain Dylan HartleyGovernments urged to stockpile antibiotics for a future flu pandemic Gay couples in Japan join together on Valentine\u0026#39s Day to sue government over same-sex marriage banDispatch: Inside Syria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Camp of Death\u0026#39 where British mothers and children struggle to survive in legal limboFather of Isil bride says the girls are \u0026#39no threat\u0026#39 to Britain as he pleads with Government to allow them to returnA\u0026ampE performance hits all time low Duke of Edinburgh to face no further action over Sandringham crash after CPS decides against prosecutingBrexit latest odds: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenComment: To fix the backstop, Theresa May should push on with the Malthouse CompromiseSenior Philippine journalist arrested amid fears of crackdown on press freedomWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/opinion/2019/02/06/TELEMMGLPICT000187047511_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQDfO_Li8BnuRdRCVfSGXuQvhzdjcZien2ya59CfVOfk.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"social media companies want force good responsibility must become","story":"Like them or loathe them, social media companies have transformed the world in which we liveBanner: Duty of CareLike them or loathe them, social media companies have transformed the world in which we live. From finding love to toppling corrupt governments, this multi-billion dollar industry – with sharing as its organising principle – can be a force for good.As a former science and innovation minister, I know we are only at the start of this technological revolution. And I want Britain to be the go‑to place in Europe where digital platforms – including social media and messaging behemoths like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Tinder – can flourish.But that also means recognising that this great leap forward in connecting people can cause harm, to iniduals and society at large. The argument that the web should be beyond careful regulation is long past its sell by date. Social media giants have come of age and are making vast profits. Now they must take on the big responsibilities we expect of all big companies.To lead the world, therefore, Britain must set a new standard for these firms: to enhance their reputation and sustain their business models for the long term, by protecting their users.The time to act is now. A growing body of research has linked social media use to a range of mental health problems, from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and sleep problems. As the generation that use social media the most, it is those aged 16 to 24 that are being hardest hit.Duty of care puffA report by the Royal Society for Public Health suggested that social media can be more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes. Cyber‑bullying and grooming are rife on some platforms. The tragic suicide of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who was exposed to distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram, brings home the dark side of social media. Systems designed to bring people together are leaving many young people feeling isolated, alone and alienated.The harmful effects extend beyond this, however. From extremism and intellectual property scams to subverting our democratic processes, the power of social media can all too easily be perverted.So we need a new approach that all social media sites will adopt – we need something that will go viral, so to speak. As the use of social media is increasingly universal, any solutions have to be systemic – and taken seriously by all the players in the industry. This is why I am backing the Daily ’s duty of care campaign.Put simply, social media giants should have a statutory duty of care to their users, obliging them to take more responsibility for reasonably foreseeable damage caused to iniduals and the public through use of their platforms. The idea of a duty of care set out in statute is not new. For decades, companies have had a duty of care to their employees as well as employers. As Professor Lorna Woods and William Perrin point out, there is no reason why a similar system cannot be evolved for the tech industry.Real and fast progress is vital. But this will only be achieved if the tech giants take the lead in working with a willing government to design this new statutory regime. The attention paid to this issue by this newspaper and the dignified campaign of Molly Russell’s parents have forced Instagram to welcome the idea of a duty of care. That is a good start, but it will take more than words to mitigate the harmful effects of social media.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreEffective leadership involves tech giants rethinking the design of their services in a safety-conscious way. Just as passenger, public and environmental safety is critical to the car manufacturing industry, social media platforms need to see prevention of harm as core to their business. We, rightly, expect more from business, with the demands on them to operate responsibly – wherever they are – increasingly daily.Tech giants spend serious money understanding their users. Investing in tools to limit the anxiety, insecurity and depression their services can foster (for example) should be part of their license to operate.If social media companies want to be a force for good, they must share the responsibility and lead the way in dealing with the bad. This should be their covenant with their customers.Duty of Care CampaignComment: The Left think it\u0026#39s rebellious to hate Churchill, but it just shows how little they understand BritainExeter

valentines day 2019 date ideas february 14th st valentine","story":"Valentine\u0027s Day is here, with plenty of people sure to panic-purchase heart-adorned cards, bumper boxes of chocolate, bouquets of red roses and teddy bears wearing T-shirts emblazoned with cutesy messages in shops across the country.Now heavily commercialised and laden with expectation, the annual event was once a day where people earnestly showed their love and affection for another person.The oldest surviving Valentine\u0027s poem was written by a prison-entrapped, pining lover: Charles, Duke of Orleans wrote it for his wife in 1415, confined in the Tower of London after being captured at the Battle of Agincourt.However Valentine\u0027s Day was celebrated for centuries before that. From who the saint was to the best romantic gift ideas, here is everything you need to know about Valentine\u0027s Day.The event falls on the same day each year. February 14 of course - which this year is a Thursday. Couples across the globe typically recognise the annual celebration by exchanging gifts, flowers and cards, although it it isn\u0027t a public holiday in every country.Sweets for my sweet...While Valentine\u0027s Day is now heavily commercialised, the church originally decided to make the day a Christian celebration to honour St Valentine. The feast of St Valentine of February 14 was first established in 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who included Valentine among all those ... whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God.While the details of who St Valentine was are contested, one thing is agreed upon: he was martyred and buried on February 14 at the Roman cemetery on the Via Flaminia, the ancient road from Rome to Rimini.St Valentine is thought to have been imprisoned for secretly marrying Christian couplesHowever the details we have of St Valentine could be of one saint or two conflated saints with the same name this means there are many different biographies in circulation. The most popular legend is that St Valentine - a priest from Rome - was arrested after secretly marrying Christian couples, who were being persecuted by Emperor Claudius II in the third century AD.As helping Christians was considered a crime, St Valentine was imprisoned while in jail he attempted to convert the emperor to Christianity and was condemned to death. He was beaten with stones and clubs, before being beheaded outside the Flaminian Gate.According to some, while in prison St Valentine fell in love with the jailer’s daughter and sent her a love letter signed ‘from your Valentine’ on February 14, the day of his execution, as a goodbye.Wearing a coronet made from flowers and with a stencilled inscription, St Valentine\u0027s skull now resides in the Chiesa di Santa Maria in Cosmedin, on Rome’s Piazza Bocca della Verità.A casket containing a number of St Valentine\u0027s bones and a vial of his blood have been stored in the Whitefriar Street Church, in Dublin, since 1936, and couples regularly visit the religious shrine to ask him to watch over their lives.Many couples preparing to marry also head to this church on February 14, the feast day of the saint, for a Blessing of the Rings in the presence of the reliquary. Cupid is the god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars.Cupid is also known in Latin as Amor (Love). His Greek counterpart is Eros and he is just one of the ancient symbols associated with St Valentine’s Day, along with the shape of a heart, doves, and the colours red and pink.He is usually portrayed as a small winged figure with a bow and arrow which he uses to strike the hearts of people. People who fall in love are said to be ‘struck by Cupid’s arrow’.The heart was once associated with knowledge as well as feelings: Egyptians believed that the heart was the source of our memories, as well as our emotions. They placed so much value on the organ that they left it in people\u0027s bodies during mummification, while throwing all other organs, including the brain, away. And they weren\u0027t the only ones - Aristotle also believed that the heart was an organ of intellect.This idea was widely accepted until Galen, a Roman physician, said the heart was more likely to be responsible for emotions than reason - apart from love, which was found in the liver.As the influence of Christianity grew in the Middle Ages, so did the religion\u0027s pairing of the heart with love. \u0027Courtly love\u0027, where knights wooed women, became popular in the eleventh century and was tied to spiritual attainment.It became popularised in lyric poems written by troubadours, such as William of Aquitaine, one of the first troubadour poets. Some say he was likely influenced by similar views on love in the Islamic world, which he came into contact with during the First Crusade.In 1184, poet Andreas Capallenus referred to the organ as one of affection, writing ‘the pure love which binds together the hearts of two lovers with every feeling of delight’.Around the same time, members of European families began to insist their hearts were buried separately from the rest of their bodies, in places that were special to them. In 1199 King Richard I of England had his heart buried in Rouen in Normandy and his body in Anjou, where his father was buried.Over the centuries, the idea that the heart is linked to emotion has persisted and the two are now intrinsically linked.It was during the middle of the 18th century that Valentine\u0027s Day started to take off in England, with lovers sending sweets and cards adorned with flowers, ribbons and images of cupids and birds.Eventually huge numbers of printed cards replaced hand-written ones. In 1913, Hallmark Cards of Kansas City began mass producing Valentine\u0027s Day cards.Now about a billion Valentine\u0027s Day cards are exchanged every year and it\u0027s the second largest seasonal card sending time of the year.However, not all the cards are intended to be read: every year, thousands of letters addressed to Juliet are sent to Verona, where Shakespeare\u0027s fictional Romeo and Juliet lived.100 funny quotes about love, sex and marriageWhat message will you be writing to your loved one this Valentine\u0027s Day?If you\u0027re thinking of just putting Happy Valentine\u0027s Day and leaving it there - well, that\u0027s fine. Not all of us can be poets. But if you wanted to go for something a bit more elaborate, why not take inspiration from some of the greatest love letters ever written?Plus, if you want to quote the modern greats, look no further than  Culture\u0027s collection of the best love poems ever written.This trend was started by the Victorians, who thought it was bad luck to sign Valentine\u0027s cards with their names.The Victorians also started the rose-giving trend. They were the favourite flower of Venus, the Roman goddess of love, and have come to indicate passion and romance.Nowadays, more than 50 million roses are given for Valentine\u0027s Day every year. There will of course be some people who do not receive any cards, flowers or gifts on Valentine\u0027s Day. In 2016, one teenager solved that problem by buying 900 carnations and giving them to out to all the girls at his school.Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to mean buying out-of-season strawberries or boring boxes of chocolates - nowadays, there are more creative food gifts to show the love. From choux-art to cookery classes, here is how to woo the ravenous and romantic in style.Consider all things choux. Maitre choux patisserie\u0027s signature bake for 2019 is the \u0027Red Love\u0027: a delightful macaron eclair filled with Tahitian vanilla cream and a delicious raspberry purée. £5.80 from maitrechouxFor people who want to stay in Being crammed into a dining room full of other couples is out.

The chefs offer everything from quality Italian to Japanese to Michelin. It’s basically an upmarket Deliveroo, so expect to pay more dough than your average takeaway, but it can be less than eating out. www.labelleassietteFor the perfect romantic dateThe Ritz London is holding a range of afternoon tea sittings on Valentine\u0027s Day this year, with 18 loose-leaf teas to choose from and a selection of finger sandwiches, scones and pastries to devour, completed with a delightful glass of rosé champagne. Kay Plunkett-Hogge suggests a cocktail or three to get you in the Valentine\u0027s Day mood - or to get you through it, depending on your romantic state of mind...Celebrate Valentine\u0026#39s Day with a cocktail or twoOn Valentine\u0027s Day, sometimes a bunch of flowers won\u0027t do - you need a grand romantic gesture, writes Helen O\u0027Hara. For inspiration, here are some of the best ever captured on film:A real contender for the title of greatest rom-com ever, and certainly the quickest witted, the climax here sees star reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) realise that her editor and ex-husband Walter Burns (Cary Grant) has engineered their quest for a scoop so that it also sabotages her plans to marry again. Instead of raging at such temerity, she falls gratefully into his arms. It’s a beautifully executed little twist, making it clear that the pair are in cahoots even when they’re apparently working against each other.10 Things I Hate About You (1999) - The Shakespearean-ish sonnetHeath Ledger’s grandstanding performance of I Love You Baby gets mentioned a lot in relation to romantic gestures in this film – but that’s a lark that’s relatively easy to laugh off. In terms of putting yourself out there for your other half, Julia Stiles’ Kat takes the bigger risks. First, she flashes a teacher to give Ledger’s Patrick the chance to escape detention. Then she reads a sonnet, no less, revealing her feelings for him to her entire class. The guts required are almost unthinkable.Beauty and the Beast (1991) - The libraryBelle (Paige O’Hara) isn’t particularly materialistic in this Oscar-nominated animation, but she’s as susceptible as the next bookworm to the gift of an entire, enormous library. This one comes with a convenient sofa by the fire and sweeping baroque staircases to shelves that stretch about 200ft. in the air. The fact that the Beast (Robbie Benson) – previously bad-tempered and hostile – presents his revelation with a charming degree of shyness and hope just makes it all the sweeter. He was originally cursed for his selfishness, so the thought counts all the more here.While Britons tend to think of red roses, corny cards and chocolates when it comes to Valentine\u0027s Day, some countries around the world celebrate love differently and have their own traditions.In Denmark, couples exchange pressed white flowers called snowdrops while in the Philippines, weddings and vow renewal ceremonies significantly increase on the romantic day, with couples gathering at shopping centres and other public places to tie the knot.In South Africa, women wear their hearts on their sleeves on Valentine\u0027s Day, quite literally, by pinning the names of their love interests to their shirts.China celebrate its own version of Valentine\u0027s Day called Qiki, during which young women prepare offerings of fruit to Zhinu, a heavenly king\u0027s daughter, in the hope of finding their perfect match.In Brazil, they celebrate Dia dos Namorados, translating as Lovers\u0027 Day, on June 12, with music festivals and performances, while in Argentina, they celebrate love for an entire week during July, in what is called Sweetness Week.If you\u0027re single and looking for love, look no further than online dating. Any stigma which may have surrounded searching for love online has been banished, and meeting for a mid-week Tinder date is no longer something people feel they have to lie about.But given how much choice is out there, how can you separate the wheat from the chaff? We\u0027ve selected the top 20 dating apps to help you find your perfect match.Looking for love?

SussexThe Duke of Sussex has spoken of sport\u0027s amazing ability to change people\u0027s lives as he kicked off a rugby charity fundraising night attended by past and present England stars.Harry met the current crop of national players and their head coach Eddie Jones at the event and England\u0027s Rugby World Cup winning heroes - Jonny Wilkinson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jason Leonard.The night was in aid of Try for Change, an England rugby programme committed to supporting disadvantaged young people, and mental health charity the Jonny Wilkinson Foundation.After watching a video showing young men who had developed personally after playing rugby Harry, who was taking part in a question and answer session with England co-captain Dylan Hartley, described the benefits of sport.The duke, who is patron of the Rugby Football Union, said: Sport has an amazing ability to bring people together, it doesn\u0027t matter what size, shape, background or beliefs that you have.He went on to say: In the world today where there is so much missing from community up and down this country I think rugby - and I may get a boo for this - not just Rugby Union but Rugby League as well...rugby as a sport has an amazing ability to change people\u0027s lives.Harry was in the royal box to watch England\u0027s emphatic win against France in the Rugby Six Nations championship at the weekend.The duke has been a lifelong rugby fan playing the sport at school until he was injured and among the cheering fans who watched England win the Rugby World Cup in 2003.Most of the England squad declined the offer of champagne and wine when they first arrived despite this weekend being a rest period before their crunch game against Wales towards the end of February.England player Brad Shields chatted with Harry before the evening began with his teammates, and later spoke about supporting the charity night being staged in the grounds of Kensington Palace.He said: I think it\u0027s humbling and brings you down to earth a little bit to know you\u0027re in a pretty good position and to use that for good.Speaking about training on Thursday, he added: We\u0027ll just go out there and hopefully get a good run leading into the Welsh game - would be nice.Harry departed before the dinner and silent auction began and left the players and supporters of the two charitable causes to enjoy the night.Duke of SussexComment: The Left think it\u0026#39s rebellious to hate Churchill, but it just shows how little they understand BritainExeter

The argument revolves around a feature called envelope tracking, which allows the phones to improve their battery life while they send and receive wireless signals.Qualcomm claimed that some of the non-Qualcomm\u0026nbspchips Apple was using infinged those patents, and should be removed from sale.German courts agreed with Qualcomm, and banned sale of the iPhones that used those chips. That led Apple to completely remove those phones from sale in both its retail and online stores, while an appeal continues.Now Apple said it will put those phones back on sale, but will only use the versions that feature the Qualcomm chips and so will be in line with the court\u0027s decision.The dispute between Apple and Qualcomm has been felt across the world. In December, Apple was also ordered to stop selling some iPhones in China because of a similar argument.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The losses are not due to any changes to the UK’s trading relationship with the EU, but instead are “related to expectations of future changes, and uncertainty about future changes”, he said.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCompanies have told the central bank that Brexit fears had hit\u0026nbspinvestment, with many scaling back plans for expansion.

Mark Carney warns of further market volatility due to no-deal fears“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the bank, as it held the base rate at 0.75 per cent. BoE governor Mark Carney also warned that the risk of a no-deal Brexit had gone up. “I would have described no deal, no transition, a few years ago as a low-probability event,” he said. “I would describe it now as not the central scenario.

It was hastily signed despite Seaborne having no ferries, no track record and no contracts with ports at either end of its proposed Ramsgate-to-Ostend route.Weeks after Grayling\u0027s department quietly released the contract notification on Christmas Eve, he announced it had been\u0026nbspcancelled, ostensibly because potential backer Arklow Shipping\u0026nbsphad walked away.How did the ‘no-boats’ ferry contract\u0026nbsphappen?The public spending watchdog released a memo this week on the DfT’s procurement of extra ferry capacity.It found the DfT had struggled to generate any interest from ferry companies to run the extra services. Perhaps as a result of this, the DfT\u0026nbspoffered what looked like a sweetener for the Seaborne deal.The contract promised £3m to the Tory-run council in Thanet\u0026nbspto cover the cost of preparing\u0026nbspthe little-used port of Ramsgate for freight ferries, which hadn’t run a service since the last operator collapsed in 2013.\u0026nbspThe contract would not go ahead without this money. Grayling had assured the Commons that no taxpayers’ money would be spent unless services started. But a dredger, estimated to cost at least £14,000 a day for a month, was clearing the harbour on Wednesday despite no contract being in place.The DfT says it is not paying for it, but it is unclear why or how a private company with no known customers would fund the work unless public backing had been assured.\u0026nbspThe council postponed voting on its budget at the eleventh hour last week after a call from Chris Grayling. Local sources speculate the transport secretary made renewed promises of funding. The DfT would not comment on any assurances.In truth Seaborne Freight is merely one window into the DfT’s handling of the options for air, land and sea routes between the UK and EU after Brexit.The NAO’s memo revealed that Grayling’s department, tasked with preparing the nation\u0027s trade routes, was itself woefully underprepared.The shipless ferry contract isn’t Grayling’s only recent failureLabour demands May sack Grayling amid claims he misled parliamentGrayling’s incompetence sends the worst message about Brexit BritainThe DfT only realised in September that there was an urgent need for more capacity to prevent significant no-deal Brexit disruption at Channel ports supplying more than a fifth of the UK’s goods.It decided not to go through the normal open tender process and instead contacted nine ferry operators privately and asked them to bid.Only three did so. All of them were awarded contracts, but the amount of capacity secured was less than half of what the DfT had hoped.\u0026nbspDespite Theresa May\u0027s claims in the Commons on Wednesday that full due diligence was carried out there was almost no time for checks.\u0026nbspThat didn\u0027t prevent Deloitte, Mott MacDonald and Slaughter and May\u0026nbspcollecting\u0026nbsp£800,000 between them for their advice on the procurement process.But in terms of due dilligence Slaughter and May carried out only a rudimentary “blush test” which checked things like Companies House records. Mott MacDonald and Deloitte both flagged concerns with the latter stating that it was not possible to conduct financial checks on a company with no financial history.Created with Sketch.

And the contracts may never even go ahead if a deal is agreed.\u0026nbspHow much does this matter?These sums are trivial compared to the vast damage that could be wrought by a chaotic no-deal Brexit. The DfT put the cost of six months of disruption at ports without intervention at £5.25bn, others put it higher.A charitable analysis of Grayling\u0027s performance would say that the minister is dealing with a unique\u0026nbspset of circumstances under immense time pressure.However, given what we now know about Seaborne Frieght, what might be uncovered elsewhere\u0026nbspif hundreds of other Brexit preparedness contracts were subject to the same level of scrutiny?\u0026nbspTo take one example, what has happened to the £29m earmarked for Operation Brock Grayling’s plan to turn much of East Kent into an emergency lorry park?Kent county councillor Paul Messenger says many of the roads to be resurfaced as part of the plan simply don’t need it.\u0026nbspThis is just a tiny fraction of the £2bn awarded by government departments in December to get ready for life outside the EU.It seems hopeful to think that the rest has been allocated any more efficiently.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The government has admitted it has run out of time for no-deal Brexit supplies and the ports are in no position to cope with what\u0027s coming.\u0026nbspYes, inflation fell, but cheaper energy played a big role and prices are going back up as a result of Ofgem raising its price cap. So it won’t last.\u0026nbspBut wait, we’re not here to criticise. We’re here to sing that Monty Python song, “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life”. So here\u0027s one big consolation from the current mess. However it ends, it should once and for all nail the Tories’ claim to economic competence, or any form of competence come to think of it.\u0026nbspThere is a subset of people that will vote for them because of that. You’ll hear them saying things like, “well I know they\u0027re b******s, but at least they\u0027re b******s that know what they\u0027re doing”.\u0026nbspRight now they\u0027re proving themselves to be just b******s, without even the redeeming feature of being good at it.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding recent polls, that might make it a lot harder for them to get elected than previously when people look at the \u0027Conservative Party Candidate\u0027 under the name of their local MP, particularly if he or she is one of the Brexitremists Prime Minister\u0026nbspMay is in hock to.\u0026nbspIf you have two bad options, but one pays at least lip service to caring about the sick, the poor, the disabled, schools, hospitals etc while\u0026nbspthe other is just\u0026nbspflat out rubbish and mean with it, well, you do the maths.\u0026nbspStill not much of a fan of the Corbynistas, who could be\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspbeneficiaries of this? Well here’s a consolation especially for you, courtesy of Ford’s warning that it will do whatever is necessary to protect itself from May’s hard Brexit.\u0026nbspThat will inevitably mean shutting down car plants and throwing people out of jobs.\u0026nbspFord\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspfar from the only car company set to swing the axe.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing good about being chucked out of a job. It\u0027s\u0026nbsphorrible. I speak from personal experience.\u0026nbspBut it will mean less members and perhaps\u0026nbspless influence for Unite’s Len McCluskey. He’s been palling around with May and Business Secretary Greg Clark of late, and is seen as one of the chief blocks to\u0026nbspLabour doing what it should do and supporting a final say vote, which is about the only thing that could save us from this godawful mess.\u0026nbspSlim pickings, it has to be said, but I did tell you I was taking uber strong happy pills. Wait, I\u0027m feeling the full effect now.\u0026nbspSo maybe Len’s members will be alright after all. Maybe Ford’s warning, and that of the BCC, puts some backbone into the limited number of Tories who are still possessed of a little sanity and actually care about their country.\u0026nbspClark is supposed to be one of them. There are allegedly up to 20 ministers who, we are told, have threatened to walk if May moves to drop the hammer on every last one of us.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The losses are not due to any changes to the UK’s trading relationship with the EU, but instead are “related to expectations of future changes, and uncertainty about future changes”, he said.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCompanies have told the central bank that Brexit fears had hit\u0026nbspinvestment, with many scaling back plans for expansion.

Mark Carney warns of further market volatility due to no-deal fears“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the bank, as it held the base rate at 0.75 per cent. BoE governor Mark Carney also warned that the risk of a no-deal Brexit had gone up. “I would have described no deal, no transition, a few years ago as a low-probability event,” he said. “I would describe it now as not the central scenario.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being.

Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise.

He must carry ampoules for injection in the event of an emergency, but these have a limited shelf-life and he needs regular fresh supplies.He recently went to his usual pharmacy\u0026nbspto obtain a new batch of these life-saving drugs, but was informed by the pharmacist that she did not have them in stock. She told Woodman that “we can’t get hold of them” and explained it was because of Brexit.If Brexit is reversed ‘there will be blood on the streets’The experience of being denied the drugs that he needs to keep himself alive reinforced Woodman’s opposition to the UK leaving the EU. “I am horrified by the biggest act of national self-harm in my lifetime – I am 52 – and probably going back a lot earlier,” he says. “It’s not as bad as going to war, but it’s not far off.”The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nursesHe does not see the political and economic damage as something confined to a post-Brexit future, but as a destructive process that is underway and already inflicting losses among real people. As a regional organiser for Unison in Wales, he deals with the problems of union members such as staff at less well-known and less well-funded universities that can no longer attract foreign students. The prospective students are deterred by Brexit uncertainties over their status and qualifications but formerly paid high fees and were an essential cash-cow for the institutions.Woodman says he is particularly concerned about the University of South Wales. Brexit, he believes, “has the capacity to bankrupt the place because the supply of overseas students has dried up”. Other universities are coming under intense financial pressure, meaning “lecturers and support staff are being let go … I am trying to save my members’ jobs”. He adds that Brexit is exacerbating the crisis in the NHS in Wales because of the difficulty in recruiting foreign doctors and nurses who have hitherto kept it going.Ian Thomas, a psychiatric nurse at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, agrees that the active recruitment of foreign medical workers has been essential. “The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nurses,” he says.Created with Sketch.

The first concrete signs of this are in higher education and health as well as in international companies such as Airbus and Nissan. But it is the political changes in Britain produced by the 2016 referendum which are more advanced and more visible than the economic ones – and which have the potential to be much more serious.Two very different political trends have gathered pace since the vote to leave the EU and are becoming irreversible: Britain is a far more ided society, perhaps more so than at any time since the Home Rule crises in the 19th and early 20th century and possibly since the turmoil of the 17th century. “People who lived happily next door to each other are now at daggers drawn,” says Woodman. Grievances that have little or nothing to do with the EU\u0026nbsphave been energised and envenomed by the anti-EU vote.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisCardiff and south Wales are a useful guide to the politics of Brexit in Britain because the outcome of the referendum here helps demolish conventional wisdom about why a majority of those who went to the polls in the rest of Britain wanted to exit the EU.\u0026nbspWales voted Leave\u0026nbspby 52.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent, which surprised some because it receives substantial EU subsidies, amounting to £680m a year, according to the Welsh government. What’s more, Remain\u0026nbspwas backed by the Labour Party, which has dominated Welsh politics for the past 97 years. Yet only five out of 22 local authorities voted to remain, very much mirroring the split in England between poor and better off, less educated and well-educated, old and young.Cardiff, a prosperous-looking city of 350,000 – one of five UK cities most dependent on EU markets – voted 60 per cent to stay in the EU. But the valleys just to the north of Cardiff, a de-industrialised region once filled with coal mines and steel plants, opted strongly for Leave. The pattern of voting was much the same as in England, though the valleys are famous for their strongly-held Welsh identity and loyalty to the Labour Party, something which they were to confirm in the 2017\u0026nbspgeneral election.In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our houseThe outcome of the referendum in Wales puts in doubt the widely credited belief that Brexit was significantly fuelled by resurgent English nationalism and nostalgia for a lost imperial past. This thesis looks less convincing if Welsh socialists, who do not feel the same about the British empire and are still bitter about the crushing of the miners’ strike in 1984-85, voted the same way as English Leavers.Care also needs to be taken when arguing about the degree to which the Brexit vote was propelled by opposition to immigration and Islamophobia, because, while there are many immigrant communities in Cardiff, there are very few in the valleys,\u0026nbspwhere there is not a single mosque according to residents.Of course, the absence of immigrants on the street does not necessarily mean that there is no hostility towards their presence\u0026nbspnationally. Local opinion is split on this, but Graham Simmonds, an independent member of Caerphilly Council who is a Leave supporter, says that emphasis on anti-immigration as an issue in the valleys “is just a stick that the media uses to beat us”. He adds: “I have never encountered it.”Whatever the role of the anti-immigrant vote, there is a simple reason why Cardiff, a government centre with much employment in health and education (it has three universities), should vote differently from the families of former miners and steel workers in the valleys.West Wales and the valleys, once a hub\u0026nbspof the industrial revolution in Britain, today top the list of the five poorest areas in northern Europe, according to 2016 figures. Interestingly, the next four on the list are all in England: Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, and the Tees Valley and Durham. As in Wales, these deprived regions voted strongly for Brexit, with Lincolnshire having the highest proportion of Leave voters in the UK. Poverty, not national identity, appears to be the dominant factor.UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitImmigration is an easy explanation for people in deprived areas who want to know why they are jobless or have ill-paid, insecure employment. Pro-Brexit tabloids have for decades drip-fed readers with stories portraying immigrants as parasites on the NHS and the undeserved recipients of largesse through exploiting state benefits.Even so, it is difficult to judge the extent of anti-immigrant feeling, because people are embarrassed to express it and, even when they did in interviews with The Independent, some later asked for their comments to be removed. Police figures for hate crimes or abuse are not very accurate because officers often do not have the resources, the numbers or the inclination to follow such incidents up, according to Cardiff residents.Those from ethnic minorities in the city are better judges of the extent to which the referendum and its aftermath turbo-charged racism in Britain and raised it to a new and more toxic level. Trade union leaders from minority communities (Pakistani, Sikh, Caribbean, Portuguese) spoke to The Independent about their personal experience of racism and about their members who had filed or been the targets of complaints about alleged abuse. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShavanah Taj is a national officer for the Public and Commercial Services Union, whose father came from Pakistan to work in a steel plant in south Wales in 1958-59. She is married to a Nigerian and has two children aged five and seven. She says that racist abuse has markedly increased in the last three or four years, though she stresses that it was also bad in the past.\u0026nbsp“In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our house.” She says this of kind of abuse ebbed in the following years, but has now returned – and strengthened. \u0026nbspAs an Asian woman with two small children, she says she has been harassed by white men who block her way in the street. Invariably, when she walks into a shop “the security guard will follow me around”.For the first time she and her husband are asking themselves if they\u0026nbspwill get to the point when they\u0026nbspno longer think of the areas as\u0026nbsphome.\u0026nbspPreviously, she and her family had never felt it necessary to have a Plan B about where they should live.\u0026nbspNow they wonder if they ought to.Created with Sketch.10 novels to help you beat the Brexit blues Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendAmarjite Singh, a Sikh who works for the Royal Mail, is branch secretary of the Communications Workers Union and wears a distinctive red turban. He agrees with Taj that open racism receded from the end of the 1980s up to 2016. Other are less sanguine and say there has been mounting Islamophobia propelled by 911, 77 and the rise of Isis after 2014.Singh says\u0026nbspthe most significant change is the degree to which the extreme right is today able to mobilise\u0026nbsppeople. “I haven’t seen so many far-right demonstrations up and down the country ever before with rallies on the same weekend in Birmingham, Leeds and Newcastle,” he says.I know a plasterer who told me that he is now reading a book by Tommy Robinson called ‘Enemy of the State’, which he says is the first book that he has ever readBrexit may originally have been about leaving the EU and about anxiety over immigration from Eastern Europe – indeed, says Singh, many Sikhs voted Leave because they thought foreigners were coming to take their jobs. But then they found that immigrants from the subcontinent and beyond were also targeted.Singh recalls:\u0026nbsp“Two weeks ago I was on a bus and there was a Somali woman with a baby in a pram who could not put it in the space allotted for it because a young man was blocking it. When the bus driver told him to let her park the pram there, the young man replied: ‘Who does she think she is?\u0026nbspShe’s only a foreigner’.”Woodman, whose mother immigrated to the UK from Portugal in 1952 and whose father came from Guyana, agrees that the Brexit vote has exacerbated racism, saying: “It emboldens people, as it does in Trump’s America, to say in public what they used to say in private. I have been called the n-word and that rarely happened in recent years.” He adds that it is wrong to blame everything on Brexit, but he finds it difficult to think of any other explanation for the racist surge.It’s time to call out broken Brexit promises on tradeWhite indigenous residents in south Wales confirm that the extreme right is becoming legitimised in a way that it was not in the past. Ian Thomas, who has long campaigned against racism, says\u0026nbsphe is more worried now than he has ever been before, because he believes that racial hatred, that was always there, but hidden, is coming increasingly to the surface.The rise of the extreme right and open displays of racism have occurred in the past (Oswald Mosley in the 1930s, the Notting Hill riots in the 1950s, Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood”\u0026nbspspeech in 1968, the National Front in the 1970s) but they have peaked and then evaporated or returned to obscurity. Often, they took advantage of periods of acute economic and political instability which came to an end.What is so different about the current crisis over Brexit is that there is no reason why the crisis should come to an end any time soon, and every reason why it should get worse, providing the far-right with fertile ground to expound their racist creed.Not all the arrows point in the same direction and some polls show that hostility to immigrants has receded somewhat since 2016, when Syrian refugees were flooding into Europe and Isis was carrying out highly publicised atrocities in the centre of European capitals.But in the eyes of many people, immigrants remain a threat and the evidence is that this perception has not changed very much. As Woodman says, all that you need to do to generate racial hatred “is to persuade people that those who are different from themselves are the reason they are poor”.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.She dresses like a primary school teacher, smiles like the Cheshire cat, and sees the best in absolutely everybody: Kimmy Schmidt is an unusual heroine today. There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm.

This all seems very much at\u0026nbspodds with earlier comments from Carney that Brexit could wipe 8 per cent off GDP and that house prices could crash by as much as 35 per cent.On the face of it, this is a conversion to rival Paul’s as he approached Damascus in AD5.

He talked about, among other things, the effects of a slowdown in China. Then he placed Brexit in the context of broader upheavals stemming from globalisation. The crisis in policing shows the danger of a single-issue government“Trade tensions abroad and Brexit debates at home are manifestations of fundamental pressures to reorder globalisation,” Carney said.“It is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy.”But crucially he then laid out a second point that has conveniently been left out of a number of accounts: “At the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and prosperity for all.”Carney’s approach here should not surprise anyone. He is an economist and a central banker, not a political pundit. In that role he doesn’t back one side of a debate or another he puts forward a range of possible outcomes, based on analysis.He is used to traders and market commentators poring over and dissecting his every word for a sign of where interest rates are heading, and so he deliberately gives little away.But what about that project fear doom-mongering in months gone by?As it happens, Carney\u0026nbspdidn’t say house prices would crash by 35 per cent or that GDP would drop 8 per cent in a year. In both cases he laid out a number of best, worst and middling scenarios.The middle scenario rarely makes for the best headline.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But few people will feel the impact more sharply than the 3.5 million EU nationals who have built their lives in this country – and who are now having to take steps to secure their right to be here.The government has pledged that all EEA citizens (ie those from the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), their family members and dependents living in the UK on or before 29 March\u0026nbspcan remain in the country with no loss of their rights.The EU Settled Status Scheme, which opened fully last month, is designed to facilitate this, providing – in the words of Sajid Javid –\u0026nbspa “simple, streamlined process for residents and EU citizens and their family members to obtain their new UK immigration status”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut campaigners warn that it risks leaving thousands of EU nationals undocumented – and pushing them straight into the claws of the so-called “hostile environment”.The obligations on employers, landlords and doctors to make routine immigration checks under existing\u0026nbspmeasures mean that anyone who doesn’t obtain settled status before the deadline – 30 June 2021 – could suddenly find themselves unable to work, rent or access healthcare.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentOne of the main concerns is\u0026nbsplack of awareness.

There is real fear that tens of thousands of people will miss the “arbitrary cliff-edge” deadline simply because they do not know about the scheme.There are also concerns that mistakes will be inevitable as the Home Office takes on a\u0026nbspsignificant increase to its caseload.\u0026nbspIt is unclear whether current provisions of staffing and training in the department are sufficient to meet the need – and the number of blunders exposed in the past year suggests it is already struggling. This could leave people wrongly denied settled status simply due to administrative\u0026nbsperrors.Even people who do successfully apply for the Settled Status Scheme could\u0026nbspfeel the force of the hostile environment, as they are suddenly\u0026nbsprequired to prove their immigration status each time they get a new job, rent a home or go\u0026nbspto the GP.Some landlords and employers may start choosing British passport-holders over EU nationals simply to avoid the extra bureaucracy, making them inadvertent victims of dicrimination.The government has made little\u0026nbspattempt to remedy the hostile environment measures which proved so detrimental to Windrush nationals – now EU citizens risk falling into the same trap.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

the love with others in need this Valentine\u0027s DayWhen it comes to the perfect V-Day gift, it’s all about balanceIt is perhaps for these\u0026nbspreasons he has come to be considered the patron saint of love and lovers, a slightly contradictory notion for a faith at other\u0026nbsptimes placing an emphasis on self-denial.An alternative explanation comes from Geoffrey Chaucer, whose Parliament of Foules (1380) mentions: “Saint Valentine’s day, when every bird comes there to choose his mate.”Few details can be substantiated from the saint’s biography relating to romance, the argument goes, so his association with the theme has more to do with fanciful revisionism in the Middle Ages, Chaucer associating his matrydom and feast day with the arrival of spring and the optimism and renewal the season represents.Chaucer’s influence was carried thereafter by the poets, from Shakespeare to John Donne, and by the Victorian era the custom of exchanging cards or gifts as tokens of affection had taken hold.St Valentine’s\u0026nbspskull, crowned with flowers, is on display at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, while the rest of his bodily remains are retained at St Anton’s Church in Madrid, Spain.The one exception is his heart, which\u0026nbsphas been held at Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland, since 1836, where it serves as a site of Christian pilgrammage for those in search of true love.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It will have an insurmountable impact on the UK,” he told the Financial Times, adding that Britain was a “more diminished country compared to what it was two or three years ago”.Sony and Panasonic are among high-profile names to have cited Brexit in their relocation, but the trade and investment arm of the Dutch government, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, has been actively soliciting more firms and says hundreds more are on the verge of moving.Mr Rutte also said Britain’s allies on the continent were aghast at the fact the UK was doing little to stop a no-deal Brexit.“At the moment the ball is rolling towards the Dover cliff and we are shouting ‘Stop the ball from rolling any further’ but nobody is doing anything at the moment, at least not on the UK side,” he said.Responding to Mr\u0026nbspRutte’s comments, the PM’s spokesman said: “I disagree entirely. Employment is at a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK.“Deloitte named the UK as Europe’s leading destination for foreign direct investment and London as the world’s top city for investment just last month.”Reports out of Westminster and accidental leaks from UK Brexit negotiators suggest Theresa May wants to wait until the very last moment to force her MPs to vote through her Brexit deal.But the brinkmanship raises the prospect of a possible no-deal, as sought by some hardline Conservative MPs.Mr Rutte said that as a result of the exodus the Netherlands had only seen benefits from Brexit so far – though his country could face serious disruption at its ports and airports in the event of a no-deal.Created with Sketch.Politicians\u0027 Brexit tweets don\u0027t hold up well to time or fact Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.These billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThese billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThe Dutch government has sometimes appeared better prepared for Brexit than the UK, with advanced plans to recruit as many as 1,000 extra border officials to deal with potential disruption and extra bureaucracy caused by the UK’s exit.In addition to private businesses, the UK has also lost a key EU agency to Amsterdam: the European Medicines Agency, which employs around 900 highly skilled workers.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

We should not be helping to deliver Brexit.”Mr Lewis – who resigned to oppose the triggering of Article 50 exit notice in 2017 – again called for an in-or-out Final Say referendum on the prime minister’s deal.He also warned of a future European war, as Brexit propelled the rise of the far right, saying: “If we walk away from Europe now, my children, your children, or possibly our grandchildren, will be back in Europe in a few years’ time – but in uniform.”Brexit \u0027uncertainty\u0027 blamed as airline cancels UK flightsBrexit already costing UK £800m per week, Bank of England expert saysUK a \u0027diminished country on the wane\u0027 after Brexit vote, says Dutch PMDefeating May in Commons would \u0027hit PM\u0027s chance to win concessions\u0027“We cannot forget what Europe has done to keep the peace in Europe.”A second frontbencher – rail spokeswoman Rachel Maskell – also called for a referendum on the Brexit outcome.Labour’s official position is still to press for a general election, if its softer Brexit plan is rejected in the Commons, with a fresh public vote only “an option”.Frontbench supporters of a referendum are becoming increasingly frustrated by Mr Corbyn’s failure to switch to outright support – even after the prime minster rejected Labour’s proposals, which include staying in a customs union.Resignations are possible if the Labour leader continues to sit on the fence when the next round of Brexit votes take place on 27 February.However, shadow ministers are keen for a concerted move, which would need to be led by the shadow cabinet, where Keir Starmer, the Brexit spokesman, is pushing for a referendum.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Perhaps with some additional words which the attorney (general) can say have real significance, but it will be essentially the same deal. That is not holding your nerve, that is plain reckless and we have to say no.That\u0027s why Labour\u0027s amendment today is intended to put a hard stop to running down the clock, it says that on the 27\u0026nbspFebruary the government must put a deal to the House for its approval or bring an amendable motion so the House can take control of what happens next and it\u0027s essential that we do so.Sir Keir Starmer says Labour has concerns about the backstop but so close to Brexit accepts that there needs to be a backstop.\u0026nbspHe is asked by Conservative backbencher Sarah Wollaston when Jeremy Corbyn will back a second referendum, and dodges the question it completely.\u0026nbspSir Keir Starmer says Theresa May has spent weeks and weeks and weeks trying trying to renegotiate the backstop...and she\u0027s got absolutely nowhere.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe adds: The simple and painful truth is this if there had been a viable alternative to the backstop there would never have been a backstop.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, says Theresa May is pretending to make progress while running down the clock.\u0026nbspBut he suggested her threats of no deal were empty, saying:As for the prime minister, taking us out of the EU on the 29\u0026nbspMarch of this year without a deal - we\u0027ll see about that. We\u0027ll see about that.I don\u0027t think the majority in this House are going to countenance that, I think the majority in this House will do everything they can to prevent that.He added: And deep down I do not think that this prime minister will take us out of the EU on the 29\u0026nbspMarch, and that\u0027s the basis that we should be having this conversation.Stephen Barclay\u0027s insistence that no deal remains an option has not gone down well with Tory Remainers. Caroline Spelman says\u0026nbspit is contemptuous of this House after MPs voted on 29 January against a no-deal Brexit.Asked why the government appears to be ignoring a Commons vote last month against a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit, Stephen Barclay says MPs also\u0026nbsppreviously voted for laws settling the ball rolling on the UK\u0027s departure from the EU on 29 March, and the legislation frankly takes precedence over that motion.Opening the Brexit debate in the Commons, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, says Theresa May needs more time to\u0026nbsptake Parliament\u0027s mandate for a deal to the EU.He says:On\u0026nbsp29\u0026nbspJanuary a majority of honourable and right honourable members told this House, and our country, that they would support a deal.But this support was conditional, that members were prepared to compromise on issues but not on the overriding issue of the backstop.He added that this Parliament\u0027s mandate must now be given the time to achieve its end, and the prime minister the chance to do so, adding that it is clear the priority is to address the indefinite nature of the backstop.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the slightly weird moment in the Commons when Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House, read out a Brexit-themed Valentine\u0027s Day poem...\u0026nbspJohn Bercow has just announced which amendments he will allow MPs will vote on tonight - and there are only three.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThey are:\u0026nbspAmendment A, tabled by Jeremy Corbyn (Labour) - would force the government to offer a meaningful vote by the end of February. If there is no deal, then the government would have\u0026nbspmake a statement on what the next steps will be.\u0026nbspAmendment E, tabled by Anna Soubry (Conservative) - tabled by anti-Brexit MPs,\u0026nbspcalls for publication of the most recent official briefing document relating to business and trade on the implications of a no-deal Brexit presented to cabinet.”.Amendment I, tabled by Ian Blackford (SNP) -\u0026nbspwould require the government to negotiate an extension of at least three months to the Article 50 process.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspStrong words from Theresa May\u0027s official spokesman in response to John McDonnell\u0027s criticism of Sir Winston Churchill. Speaking at the morning No 10 briefing for Westminster journalists, he\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbspThe British public will reach its own judgment on this characterisation of Sir Winston Churchill. I note that in 2002 he came first in a public poll of the 100 greatest Britons.The prime minister has quoted and referenced Sir Winston Churchill on many occasions and acknowledged him as one of the great prime ministers of the 20th century.She has a portrait of Sir Winston Churchill hung on the wall of her study in Number 10.His strong leadership, determination and unwavering personality inspired our country through our darkest hour and helped Britain protect those values of peace and freedom that we hold so dear today.Andrea Leadsom has just read out a Valentines Day poem in the Commons..\u0026nbspThe Leader of the House said:Labour is redTories are blueOur future is brightWith\u0026nbspa good deal in sightFor the UK and our friends in the EU\u0026nbspIn response the SNP\u0027s Pete Wishart\u0026nbsppenned a few lines of his own prose. He said:\u0026nbspLabour is redTories are blueThe message from Scotland is we are staying in the EU\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPA have produced this very helpful summary of the key amendments MPs are likely to vote on tonight...\u0026nbspGovernment motionThis apparently innocuous motion asks the House to welcome Ms May\u0027s statement on Tuesday, setting out progress in Brexit talks, note that talks on the Irish backstop are ongoing and reiterate its support for the approach to negotiations agreed the last time MPs voted, on 29 Janaury. The problem for the government is that MPs voted that day not only to authorise the PM to go back to Brussels and seek a replacement for the controversial Irish backstop, but also for a non-binding motion which would rule out a no-deal outcome. Leave-supporting backbenchers from the European Research Group fear that this would effectively mean signing up to a bar on no-deal.Labour amendmentTabled by Jeremy Corbyn and his frontbench, this would require the government to either call a vote on its withdrawal plan by 27 February or hand control to Parliament to decide the next steps. Liberal Democrats have tacked on their own amendment to this proposal, calling for a second referendum as endorsed by the Labour Party conference.Alternative voteA cross-party amendment tabled by the Father of the House, veteran Tory europhile Kenneth Clarke, would allow MPs to vote on their preferred Brexit outcome. Any Brexit option which secures the signatures of 50 or more MPs would be included on a ballot paper, and MPs would be asked to rank them in order of preference. Using an alternative vote system, the least popular option would be excluded and second-preference votes redistributed until one outcome has more than half the votes. There would then be a vote in the Commons on this option. This proposal has the backing of senior Labour backbenchers including Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey as well as Tory Remainers Dominc Grieve and Anna Soubry.Revoke Article 50Tabled by the Scottish National Party\u0027s Angus MacNeil and backed by Mr Clarke, this amendment calls on the government to revoke the letter informing the European Council of the UK\u0027s intention to leave the EU under Article 50 of the treaties, thus ending the Brexit process and allowing Britain to remain a member of the EU.Publish the papersThis amendment - backed by 60 critics of Brexit from across the House - instructs the Government to publish its most recent official briefings on the implications of a no-deal Brexit for business and trade. Tablers Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna believe the papers presented to Cabinet paint a chilling picture of the damage which no-deal will do.Indicative votesThis calls for a series of votes on 26 February\u0026nbspon various Brexit options including the PM\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement, no-deal, renegotiation of the backstop, a Canada-style deal, Norway-style membership of the EEA and a second referendum. If only one option wins a majority, Ms May would be required to ask for an extension to Article 50 beyond its March 29 deadline to pursue that outcome. If two or more won majorities, the PM would be required to hold a public vote on those options. If none commanded a majority of MPs, Mss May would have to call a second referendum with the options of her deal or Remain. Tabled by Conservative Remainer Sarah Wollaston, the proposal has backing from opponents of Brexit across the House.Plaid Cymru optionBacked by the Welsh nationalist party\u0027s four MPs, this requires the Government to extend Article 50 to provide time for a referendum on Ms May\u0027s deal or Remain. If no extension is allowed by the EU, the government would be required to commit itself to a referendum at the end of the transition period in 2021 on whether the UK should rejoin the EU.Close alignmentAn amendment signed by a small group of Labour and Plaid MPs, and tabled by Swansea West\u0027s Geraint Davies, would require an extension of Article 50 and a commitment from the PM to seek a deal - subject to ratification in a referendum - which leaves the option open for future governments to adopt Labour\u0027s current vision for post-Brexit relations with the EU, including a customs union and close alignment with the single market.SNP optionTabled by the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader Ian Blackford, this would require the government to negotiate an extension of at least three months to the Article 50 process.Liberal Democrat amendmentLiberal Democrats led by Sir Vince Cable are proposing an extension to Article 50 beyond March 29 to allow time for a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper.Three-option referendumTabled by Labour backbencher Roger Godsiff, this would require any withdrawal agreement approved by Parliament to be put to the public in a referendum. The ballot paper would have three options - to accept the agreement, leave with no deal or remain in the EU - and voters would be asked to rank them in order of preference under the alternative vote system.Security minister\u0026nbspBen Wallace\u0026nbsphas said the government will not help\u0026nbspShamima Begum, the schoolgirl who fled\u0026nbspto join Isis in 2015 and has now been found by\u0026nbspThe Times\u0026nbspliving in a Syrian refugee camp.\u0026nbspHe told BBC Radio 4\u0027s\u0026nbspToday that actions have consequences, saying:The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, for whatever reason, is putting themselves in considerable danger.Everyone who returns from taking part in the conflict in Syria or Iraq must expect to be investigated by the police to determine if they have committed criminal offences, and to ensure that they do not pose a threat to our national security.There are a range of terrorism offences where iniduals can be convicted for crimes committed overseas and we can also use Temporary Exclusion Orders to control an iniduals\u0027 return to the UK.I\u0027m not putting at risk British people\u0027s lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state - there\u0027s consular services elsewhere in the region and the strong message this government has given for many years is that actions have consequences.The latest showdown comes as European Council president\u0026nbspDonald Tusk\u0026nbspexpressed frustration at a lack of progress in London.He tweeted: No news is not always good news. EU27 still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London on how to break Brexit impasse.And Dutch PM Mark Rutte told the Financial Times the Netherlands is already benefiting from businesses relocating from a diminished Britain.In a bid to keep lines open with EU leaders, Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspspoke with French president Emmanuel Macron and Romanian president Klaus Iohannis on Wednesday evening.But she faces an immediate threat in the Commons as Tory Brexiteers have expressed concern at the thrust of part of the Government motion.Many back the fact it reiterates support for the direction agreed on January 29, when MPs supported an amendment authorising Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspto return to Brussels to renegotiate the controversial Irish backstop.But members of the backbench European Research Group (ERG) say that it effectively endorses another amendment approved by MPs that day, which rules out no-deal but is not binding on the Government.Though Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspis expected to be able to weather a defeat on the Government motion, such an outcome would be embarrassing as she seeks to get the EU to agree to changes regarding withdrawal proposals.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

They were murdered as part of a bloody turf war with Al Capone’s Italian contingent, the two factions fighting for control of Chicago’s illegal liquor black market, catering to underground speakeasies since the 18th amendment had banned the production, import or sale of alcohol in 1920.The two sides had been at war\u0026nbspsince North Side boss Dean O’Banion was shot in the back of the head while clipping chrysanthemums in his North State Street flower shop on 10 November 1924. When the Chicago Outfit’s leadership was subsequently passed on from the experienced Johnny Torrio to the less even-tempered Capone, violence became a way of life on the city’s streets.Torrio and Capone narrowly escaped attempts on their lives but O’Banion’s successor, Hymie Weiss, was not so lucky. The St Valentine’s Day Massacre was reportedly planned as a hit on Moran after he had avenged Weiss’s murder by taking out Pasqualino Lolordo, one of Capone’s made men.On 14 February, the North Siders were set up by an undercover Capone contact, who promised a shipment of Canadian whiskey hijacked from the Italians would be delivered to the SMC Cartage Company garage at 2122 North Clark Street.Moran’s men arrived before 10.30am to meet the incoming truck but, in a peculiar quirk of fate, the target himself was running late. A police car promptly arrived outside, bearing two men dressed in uniform and two more in civilian clothes. Moran, pulling up just in time to spot the quartet entering the building, quietly moved on.The four entered the depot, cornered the men and ordered them to line up against a rear wall. A hail of gunfire erupted from a brace of Thompson submachine guns and a shotgun. The perpetrators duly made a getaway in the squad car, never to be identified.\u0026nbspThe only survivor was a German shepherd named Highball, his lead tied to a parked car’s bumper nearby.The dead included Moran’s right-hand man and deputy Albert Kachellek, bookmaker Adam Heyer, business manager Albert Weinshenker, two brother enforcers – Frank and Peter Gusenberg – as well as two associates, optician-turned-gambler Reinhardt Schwimmer and mechanic John May.\u0026nbspWhen the real cops arrived, Frank Gusenburg was still alive despite being riddled with 22 bullets but refused to say who did it, dying in hospital still loyal to the thieves’ code of honour he had lived by.The killings, reported on every front page in America, provoked a public outcry.\u0026nbsp“From coast to coast, people suddenly seemed to be reaching the conclusion that a line had been crossed, that the violence had become too much to bear,” wrote Capone biographer Jonathan Eig.President Herbert Hoover met with city elders and duly instructed his attorney general, William Mitchell, to “get Capone”. Though widely suspected of having ordered the hit, the mobster was careful to be in Florida at the time it was carried out.\u0026nbspWhy do people still admire the Kray Twins?His bodyguard, “Machine Gun” Jack McGurn, was arrested and accused of being the mysterious connection who had set up the whiskey plot, but no case could be made against him. He said he had spent the day with his girlfriend, Louise Rolfe, and quickly married her to ensure she could not be pressured into testifying against him. She was thereafter popularly referred to by the press as the “Blonde Alibi”.Ballistics experts did trace the Tommy guns used in the massacre to the Michigan home of one Fred “Killer” Burke. A career criminal with ties to Egan’s Rats and the Purple Gang – mobs out of St Louis, Missouri\u0026nbspand Detroit, Michigan, respectively – Burke went on the run after he was involved in a car accident in December 1929 and killed the investigating police officer, Charles Skalay, in a moment of panic.\u0026nbspBriefly on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, Burke was found hiding out on a farm in Green City, Missouri, when a local man recognised his mugshot in a copy of True Detective magazine. He was imprisoned for the murder of Skalay in March 1931 and died nine years later of a heart attack.Though the Valentine’s Day killings were never successfully pinned on him, the murder weapons were found in Burke’s possession and he was missing a front tooth, a detail that matched an eyewitness description of one of the ersatz officers spotted fleeing the scene.\u0026nbspThe remaining killers are thought to have come from a St Louis gang known as the “American Boys”.\u0026nbspA criminal named Byron Bolton\u0026nbsptold the FBI in 1934 the Valentine’s Day hit squad had consisted of Burke and American Boys Fred Goetz, Gus Winkeler, Raymond “Crane Neck” Nugent and Bob Carey, apparently modifying the truth to exclude the fact he himself had served as lookout, hence his inside knowledge. Oddly, the bureau’s director J Edgar Hoover left the matter to local police rather than acting on the tip-off.Al Capone was finally brought down for tax evasion in 1931, the result of an extensive investigation by the Treasury’s Special Intelligence Unit\u0026nbspled by Elmer Irey and the work of agent Eliot Ness and his team of “Untouchables”, men who could not be bribed.Capone spent\u0026nbsphis final days on the island prison of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged. If anything, their mood has hardened.In a second referendum, a straight choice between Leave and Remain would turn Brexit into a landslide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s why we have rigorous safety standards. But we are in danger of going overboard.The Tories must shake themselves out of their paralysis, and find a backbone.THE police appear to be missing in action in the case of odious “Sir” Philip Green.They usually can’t wait to jump into action when they can get an easy headline, nor do they spare any effort in virtue-signalling PR operations.And yet after thehas revealed lurid allegations about his conduct and serious questions about cover-ups, there’s hardly a dickie bird.The Government, too, must act.They have been shown in black and white how the rich and powerful continue to abuse expensive gagging orders to keep shameful behaviour private – no matter the public interest. Ministers offer warm words on changes to come.But it’s time for a little more action, and a little less conversation.A DAMNING new book reveals the man his followers call “JC” is certainly no messiah.We know Jeremy Corbyn’s politics are potty, potentially leading us to a similar economic ruin to that inflicted on long-suffering Venezuelans.But it’s his personality that truly condemns him.He is not up to the job of leading Britain.SPARE us the Beeb’s bleating about how hard it’ll be to continue dishing out free licences for the over-s.The giveaway was a Gordon Brown electoral bribe and it is simply too much for the taxpayer to continue funding.If the BBC want to keep it free, the cash should come from their own bloated empire.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The BBC — fuelled by £billion of public money — has expanded into a state-backed media monster encroaching on areas that should be none of its business, from trivial “clickbait” stories to lestyle advice.After all, the BBC Charter states that it should “provide impartial news and information to help people understand  the world around them. It should offer depth and analysis not widely available from other UK news providers”.Somewhere, this has gone very wrong.It churns out so much stuff online that it could be renamed the British Publishing Corporation.In the process, the monster is devouring the market for everything from local newspapers to gossip websites.Why does “our” national broadcaster now feel obliged to publish “news” stories such as the classic “Serial poopers: What makes people poop in public ” The BBC is also hopelessly addicted to pumping out recipes. Type in “spaghetti bolognese” on Google and the first result that s is from BBC Good Food — a commercial site that trades on the broadcaster’s brand.Why is the BBC even in the already-crowded recipe market  Never heard the one about “too many cooks” By stretching its insensitive tentacles into local areas from its London and Salford HQs, the BBC has contributed to wrecking the local and regional Press, longstanding voices of real communities.At least  local and regional titles have closed since , as circulation halved from .million weekly in  to .million in .Since , the number of regional journalists has also been halved, to around ,.An estimated  per cent of the country now has no daily or weekly title.A robotic BBC web page is no substitute for local Press coverage of council meetings and court proceedings.And yet the money pours in to fund this expansion way beyond its remit.Last year the BBC spent £million on BBC Online and “Red Button” services. The national and local Press are under siege from the tech giants and their BBC collaborators. But this is about more than newspaper self-interest.The future of dirt-digging journalism and democratic debate is at stake.Cairncross estimates that “legacy newsbrands” — aka national and local newspapers — are responsible for around  per cent of all original news journalism in the UK, more than broadcasters and online-only outlets put together. That seems an underestimate.The role of the Press in reporting the news is not just a matter of historical “legacy”. As one ex-editor of a London local paper observes, “councillors and crooks must surely feel relaxed” without local hacks watching and reporting what they are up to.Every big story of recent years was broken by newspapers, from the fire risk Vauxhall Zafira and how Age UK pushed expensive power deals to OAPsto Philip Green gagging reports of sexual and racial harassment .Even last year’s most popular BBC-based story — the snogging scandal on Strictly Come Dancing — was a Sun on Sunday exclusive, before the BBC did its usual parasitical trick of topping Google searches for articles about “the Strictly Curse”.The newspaper tradition of long-form writing and forensic examination will continue to struggle as the online purveyors suck up adverts for cheap and cheerful clickbait.The print medium remains unmatched for serious analysis.Yet the BBC’s self-aggrandising aim is now to expand its global audience further, rather than meet the needs of the underserved as a public service broadcaster surely should.Thus the social media chief of BBC News, Mark Frankel, boasts of the corporation having on Facebook “the largest news page and total fanbase of any news organisation in the world”.The publicly funded BBC need not care that the tech giants don’t pay for stories, as for them Facebook is just a free publicity funnel.That alliance makes it even harder for the rest of the media to take a stand against being royally ripped off.Auntie is effectively in league with greed-driven tech giants.What of the output of all these BBC s  They claim to be a beacon of liberal ersity.The one thing the BBC can’t tolerate, however, is ersity of opinion.It is a bastion of illiberal luvvie smugness, peddling its elitism as the centre ground, blasting out conformist propaganda in Brexit-bashing  debates and Brexit-bashing comedy shows.Lord Reith, the first BBC chief, wanted the then-monopoly corporation to “inform, educate and entertain” the public, from the point of view of the British Establishment.Reith’s successors might have quite a dferent world view.But the new BBC establishment —  managers paid between £, to £, a year,  on between £, to £, — would love to have a state-backed news monopoly again, educating and informing the ignorant public, whether we like it or not.Those of us who appreciate the importance of a vibrant and erse media to democracy, should tell the BBC to get its tanks off the free Press’s lawn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he’s broken it, Mills  Boon style, “into a million pieces”.No one is suggesting that Meghan isn’t upset by the way her father and other off-message relatives have behaved — who wouldn’t be But this supposedly “private” attempt to build bridges lacks authenticity.Decades of dealing with PR spin designed to deflect suspicious journalists away from the real storyhas taught me to trust my gut instinct.And given Thomas’s previous form on speaking to the Press, it’s telling me that Meghan wrote this rather staged letter in the expectation that he would leak it and, therefore, seamlessly allow her to peddle her own narrative while maintaining the cover of the innocent party who has been betrayed by her own father yet again.But Thomas kept the letter under wraps. Until, that is, he was baited in to defending himself against claims made by some of Meghan’s close friends, who spoke anony-mously , about the duchess’s plight to the US-based People magazine.One said: “After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship’.”Look, Thomas Markle is by no means blameless. He did a deal with the paparazzi for staged photos, is clearly given to petulance, has only released the parts of the letter that suit him and, as the parent in this scenario, should be the one to stop this tit-for-tat soap opera and just shut the hell up.But equally, any sympathy one might have felt for Meghan in dealing with her off-message family is evaporating fast in the face of such a blatant PR exercise that has her manicured fingers all over it.One of the friends who spoke out has “let it be known” that the duchess herself knew nothing of them speaking to People magazine.Sorry, but I just don’t buy it. Meghan has form for dropping friends like hot potatoesthey displease her, so the notion that those who remain “close” would speak to the Press — anonymously or otherwise — without approval is, to my mind, utter bunkum.Which leads me to conclude that this was a ham-fisted, Hollywood-esque attempt to try to manipulate Press coverage and put a stop to, as her friends put it, the “global bullying” of The Duchess of Sussex. But it has backfired badly.Yes, plenty of the criticism levelled at Meghan is unfair, and some of it is downright offensive.But as the rest of the Royal Family could tell her, they’ve all suffered their share of brickbats over the years but come through it.How  By earning respect through dutul and consistent hard work, not demanding it early doors via an ill-conceived PR initiative.JENNIFER ANISTON has just celebrated her th birthday.Or “poor Jen” as she’s frequently referred to because she’s single and childless which, obviously, is something to be pitied because marriage and giving birth defines us.Meanwhile, back in the real world, the single le appears to suit the fierce Ms A very well indeed.She says she considered her marriages to be successful, but when the end came: “This is our one le and I would not stay in a situation out of fear. Fear of being alone.“To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you’re doing your one le a disservice.”She’s right, of course. But moving on is far simpler when you don’t have children together.If you do, then taking the decision to break up the family home is a far tougher one.Because your kids only have “one le” too.NOW US teenager Ethan Lindenberger has turned , he has finally had the MMR vaccination while criticising his “anti-vaxxer” movement parents for refusing to give it to him when he was younger.His mother, Jill Wheeler, who believes that vaccinations cause illnesses such as autism, says his decision is “insulting” and a “slap in the face”.Ethan, from Ohio, did his own research into the jab and commented on social media site Reddit, “God knows how I’m still alive” – presumably a reference to the fact that measles can be deadly.He probably swerved it thanks to all the parents who recognise the need for herd immunity and do have their children vaccinated.PARENTS in America say that regular viewing of children’s TV show Peppa Pig is causing their kids to start speaking in a British accent.Many moons ago, I went to collect my youngest from her first day at nursery and was greeted by an excited young assistant who hailed from Valencia.“I didn’t know your daughter could speak Spanish!”“Neither did I,” I replied.Turns out that rather too much time in front of Dora The Explorer had indeed been educational.LUNG cancer screening units are to be offered in supermarket car parks across the UK in an NHS bid to improve early detection rates.This reminds me of when a mobile cervical cancer screening unit was set up in a Birmingham car park in the s and an elderly lady approached the receptionist.She was directed to a curtained booth, given a smear test, then emerged to declare: “I’ve never had to do this to get a bus pass before.”NETFLIX documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened is proof,needed, that all on Instasham etc is not what it seems.The Fyre festival was the brainchild of US “entrepreneur” Billy McFarland, now serving six years in prison for fraud, aided and abettedby a close coterie of consultants, marketeers, media experts andonline “influencers” who helped sell the dream of an exclusive event on a luxury, Bahamian island to unsuspecting, albeit wealthy punters who turned up to find a nightmare of soggy tents, bad food and no headline acts.Among those who appeared in a promotional video and posted the event’s distinctive “orange tile” to their millions of followers to help drive ticket sales were models Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.Most notably, model Kendall Jenner was paid an eye-watering , via wire transfer for just one post about it to her million-plus followers.It shows with compelling clarity that while the power of A-list, online influence is real, what’s being promoted can sometimesbe a Grade A dud.So, buyer beware of those “influencers” who only post for favours or cash.They’re just the social media version of the old-fashioned freeloader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Somehow, they’ll stop it.” I don’t think I was alone in reckoning that.It’s looking very much like that at the moment, isn’t it  We’re  days away from deadline time, March . But what do you reckon the likelihood is of the deadline being put back  I’ll bet it is.Olly Robbins thinks it’s likely. He’s a civil servant and the Prime Minister’s chief negotiator to the EU. He was overheard jabbering about the whole business in a bar in Brussels. And he saidthere WERE a delay, it would most likely be a long one.We’ll probably all be here this time next year, then, in exactly the same position.By which time the deal will be so watered down, the whole point will have been lost. It’s pretty close to that stage right now.Why has this happened  Because our establishment do not want us to leave. And while they may pay lip service to “respecting the voice of the people”, they don’t remotely mean it. They never did.And so, on the one hand we have establishment voices — Blair, Mandelson, Heseltine — and a growing number of current politicians demanding we must have another vote. Because we got it wrong last time.The European Union has a history of ignoring popular votes and getting countries to run the vote again, after a slew of propaganda about why the people were so wrong.Then, on the other hand, we have a Prime Minister who voted Remain leading our negotiations. And at every stage of the process more and more has been given away.We started from a position of weakness by allowing the EU to dictate the order of the negotiations. So they got to demand things from us — such as extortionate amounts of money — before we even got down to talking about our trading relationship.And at every stage the deal has got weaker. Every time she came back from Brussels, something more had been given away. Until we reach today’s position, where the deal before us isn’t really leaving the EU at all.We’ll still be tied to the customs union for the foreseeable future. We will still have the horrible European Court of Justice telling us what we can and can’t do for another two years.And there are plenty of people who believe that the famous issue of the Northern Ireland backstop is simply an attempt to get us to remain, for ever, inside the customs union.Here’s what I think will happen.Brexit will, in the end, be delayed. And by the time a deal is put before us again — months down the line — it will bear no real resemblance to “leaving the European Union”.And so those of us who have no trust in our liberal establishment, because we know what scant respect it has for democracy, will be able to say: “Told you so. They were never going to let it happen.”Congratulations to young Hartlepool lad Michael Rice for becoming our entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest.He’s singing a ditty called Love Is Really Lovely or something, and will come third from last, just above Kosovo and France.Michael Rice will represent the UK at Eurovision but will probably come third from lastBut bless him, at least he’ll be going.Far left, anti-Semitic bullies have been demanding we boycott the extravaganza because it’s in Israel.A bunch of C-list celebs wrote a letterinsisting we pull out.They said nothing when the contest was held in the repressive Islamic state of Azerbaijan.Good luck, Michael.

He said: “Probably very similar to the place reserved for those who designed a monetary union without a proper banking union.“And when the financial crisis hit, cynically transferred the bankers’ gigantic losses on to the shoulders of the weakest taxpayers.”Apparently, people are their most happy when they’re  years old – and .That’s according to a new study.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The skin and ear lips are what move primarily.And while the five-year-old pooch does have a few other medical challenges, Heather says Toads le is mostly normal.She doesnt hear, see or smell very well because everything in her head is misaligned, but otherwise shes totally normal, said Heather.She is very devoted and loyal to her family. She thinks shes a lap dog and always insists on sitting on my lap.All of the other dogs move out of the way for her, everyone has accepted that she gets special attention because our bond is so tight.Other mainstays at Mutt Misfits include Scary Jack, who owes his unusual appearance to a severe case of puppy strangles.Heather said: The charity was formed because in shelter settings there arent many organisations that specialise in the special needs pups.Most rescue groups take in highly adoptable pups from shelters and re-home them.

That’s why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.”Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties - a type of nuclear reactor which uses heavy wateras a coolant to maintain temperatures in the reactor.Also under the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure Iran maintains the deal.The deal said thatIran abides by the deal it would receive relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The President also views the EU as a foe on trade.He said: “Well I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade.Now you wouldn’t think of the European Union but they’re a foe."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ac-comp-weather-graphic-17001.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather forecast valentines day hotter than california as african plume sends temperatures soaring to 16c","story":"An “African plume” sweeping over the country is expected to make the mercury shoot up today.And forecasters predicted the day of love could reach much higher than average temperatures in parts of Britain, with sunshine in abundance.A Met Office forecaster said: “Valentine’s Day isn’t the only reason it’s warming up.

It’s all about where the government is going, he told ITV.Mrs Mays ally Liam Fox said that voting it down would harm her in talks and would show the EU that Mrs May cant get a deal through Parliament.He warned: I think that theres a danger that we send the wrong signals and I think that we need to understand that the public want us to leave the European Union but they would prefer us to leave the European Union with a deal.What we say is looked at and listened to by those that we are negotiating with, he told BBC Radio s Today programme.But Brexiteers buckled down, saying they should not be associated with anything that seems to take No Deal off the table.MP Steve Baker said this morning: Compromising no deal would be the daftest negotiating strategy and not in the national interest. Todays storm in a teacup only arises because the Governments motion is not neutral. This unnecessary carry on is wanted by no one.And in a warning shot that Remainers arent happy either, Tory Nicky Morgan added: If the Government had taken the time to discuss the wording of the motion with MPs on all sides of the Brexit debate they’d have achieved a clear  united signal to the EU as Brady did on th January.Today the Prime Minister’s spokesman said: “It is important that MPs support the Prime Minister today in order to send another clear message to Brussels on the need to address parliament’s concerns about the backstop so we can leave on time, with a deal on March th.Last night Downing Street said ministers would continue to plan for No Deal and the rebellion was just a show of force because the Malthouse compromise hasnt officially been adopted as Government policy.They said that the EU could abandon talks with Britain over the hated Irish backstopshe loses tonight.It would force the Government to act within two weeks, either by holding another formal vote on the PMs deal or by declaring that the deal is now off the table permanently.SOUBRY AMENDMENT -

Harry met the current crop of national players and their head coach Eddie Jones at the event and Englands Rugby World Cup winning heroes - Jonny Wilkinson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jason Leonard. The night was in aid of Try for Change, an England rugby programme committed to supporting disadvantaged young people, and mental health charity the Jonny Wilkinson Foundation. After watching a video showing young men who had developed personally after playing rugby Harry, who was taking part in a question and answer session with England co-captain Dylan Hartley, described the benefits of sport.  The duke, who is patron of the Rugby Football Union, said: Sport has an amazing ability to bring people together, it doesnt matter what size, shape, background or beliefs that you have. He went on to say: In the world today where there is so much missing from community up and down this country I think rugby - and I may get a boo for this - not just Rugby Union but Rugby League as well...rugby as a sport has an amazing ability to change peoples lives.  Harry was in the royal box to watch Englands emphatic win against France in the Rugby Six Nations championship at the weekend. The duke has been a lelong rugby fan playing the sport at school until he was injured and among the cheering fans who watched England win the Rugby World Cup in . Most of the England squad declined the offer of champagne and wine when they first arrived despite this weekend being a rest period before their crunch game against Wales towards the end of February. England player Brad Shields chatted with Harry before the evening began with his teammates, and later spoke about supporting the charity night being staged in the grounds of Kensington Palace.   He said: I think its humbling and brings you down to earth a little bit to know youre in a pretty good position and to use that for good. Speaking about training on Thursday, he added: Well just go out there and hopefully get a good run leading into the Welsh game - would be nice. Harry departed before the dinner and silent auction began and left the players and supporters of the two charitable causes to enjoy the night.

Debonair Dogs Canine Grooming Salon in Moreton, Merseyside, today issued a statement saying the clip had been investigated and the woman involved no longer worked there.In the footage, the woman grabs the dog and holds it by the scruff of its neck before repeatedly prodding it in the ribs, making it squirm and wriggle. There is one dog in the foreground, and another tied to a metal unit at the back of the room.   The female groomer walks up to the dog at the back of the room, unleashes it, and picks it up. Unable to get a grip on the struggling dog, she holds it with one arm, and shakes it, looking at it while she does so. The dog briefly stops struggling, and the girl continues to suspend it in the air, by the scruff of the neck. With her other hand, the girl tries to grab the dogs ribs and each time the dog struggles and tries to get away. The girl then grips the dog with both hands from behind, and walks over to the front of the room towards where the other dog is.   Debonair Dogs Canine Grooming Salon released a statement on the Facebook page yesterday evening, saying: As a recent video has come to light I would like to reassure all of our customers that the girl involved no longer works under our employment and has left to start her own business. I can assure you that all the Debonair Dogs team are huge animal lovers and we love nothing more than providing you and your pooches with the best care. The girl involved has been investigated as complaints have been brought to light by other members of staff which is why we had cameras put in place to seethere was any evidence to back these complaints up - which we managed to get.  But as this is a serious matter, steps needed to be taken before it could be taken any further. We really hope to continue pampering your pooches and maintaining a caring environment for them. Thanks, Debonair Dogs team. Speaking today, the manager of Debonair Dogs, who declined to give his name, confirmed the video was taken at the grooming salon. He also confirmed the woman left the salon of her own accord two weeks ago. He said: Theres a lot of people that are really upset.  The police, the RSPCA, have been involved. I dont really want to say anything until weve sorted things out with them. I can maybe say more at the end of the week. Most Facebook users who watched the clip were disgusted by the girls actions.

Matt Sumner added: You never pick up a dog like this, its disgusting. If the dog is a nipper, its for the owners and the business to discuss and then use a muzzle. Not this. Others defended the woman, including Nicola Leanne Sayers who commented: I think she was literally just trying to get hold of the dog without getting bitten. I dont see her shaking the dog at all.

Police have tried and failed to get a search warrant to go through the serial killer’s possessions. Keith’s brother Alan has said there is a ‘desperate’ need to examine the killer’s s paperwork because he took the secret of the -year-old’s final resting place on Saddleworth Moor with him to the grave.

There seems to be no compassion or thought for Keith or his family.” He added that he had correspondence with Brady while he was alive and the serial killer told him there were ‘instructions’ for him in his will. He has made a ‘personal plea’ to Mr Makin by email and letter but claims he has heard nothing.  Brady died, aged , from cancer and emphysema in Ashworth Hospital.

A witness said he saw her head was down to the left side and was twitching and she had foam in her mouth.Tests also revealed she was twice the legal drug-drive limit for cannabis, Stoke on Trent Live reports. Little Corey Rhodes was given first aid by witnesses at the scene but sadly he couldnt be saved and died shortly after arriving at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.Rebecca, fromFenton, died after undergoing emergency surgery in hospital a day later. Her six-year-old son Kyle Rhodes, who was also in the car, survived after being airlted to Sheffield. The -year-olds BMW had veered on to the other side of Uttoxeter Road, Draycott, before hitting the Mercedes Sprinter van as she made her way to Poundland in Uttoxeter. According to a witness, the driver of the van was on the phone to the emergency services who repeated I couldnt stop. Another, Craig Barks, claimed he saw the van lt up in the air following the impact.   In a statement, he said: I was travelling along Uttoxeter Road towards the A in a Citroen Picasso. I was driving behind a Mercedes Sprinter at mph. I heard an almighty bang and I saw the van in front of me lt up about four or five feet from the surface. I got out of the van and approached a silver car and saw a woman sat in the drivers seat. She appeared to be fitting as her head was down to the left side and was twitching and she had foam in her mouth. Witness Linda Woolliscroft was travelling in the same direction as Rebecca in her Land Rover when she heard a loud bang. In a statement read out at the hearing, she said: I saw a car approaching from behind, it was a silver car that I thought was going to overtake me. Then I heard an almighty bang and I wasnt sure what had caused the bang. I looked across and noticed there had been a crash. I parked my car on a grass verge, put my hazards on and went over to try to help. I noticed it was the silver car that was behind me moments before. I noticed there were two young children in the back of the car and the driver of the van was on the phone to the emergency services who repeated I couldnt stop. I went over to the BMW and one man was trying to assess those in the car. I noticed the young boys in the back and they started CPR on Corey.  The inquest heard it is not known whether Rebecca suffered a fit before the crash or as a result of the accident. But her long-term partner James Rhodes revealed that while visiting his surviving son in hospital, Kyle told him Rebecca had suffered a fit. He said: As soon as I walked through the door, the first thing he said to me was mums had a fit and that she had no hands on the steering wheel. He would have seen Becky having fits before and he knows what one is. James added: She started to suffer some more regular fits about eight months before she died in the early part of last year. When I was at work the kids would tell me she had a fit and they were around once every three months. On the one occasion she had three fits in one day. Her medication was increased and she still had fits. She took her medication but sometimes shed miss it. Becky didnt use any illegal drugs apart from having around three cannabis cigarettes a night when the kids had gone to bed. Corey was in reception and was a happy-go-lucky child. Kyle would always wear his seat belt, but Corey from time to time would put part of the belt behind his neck. Corey and Kyle could be a distraction in the carthey were fighting as five and six-year-old brothers do.  Collision investigator PC Roger Wetton said that there was no evidence that Rebecca had informed the DVLA about her epilpesy. PC Wetton said: The BMW drove along the central hatch marks into the lane of the Mercedes. The van driver didnt see it as a problem until he had insufficient time to. A collision occurred between the front of both vehicles, both rotated in an anti-clockwise direction. Witnesses say the driver appeared to be having a fit. Her condition was not disclosed to the DVLA, which would have resulted in her licence being removed. PC Wetton added both Kyle and Corey were not in child booster seats. He said: Neither child had a hard seat and Corey was not wearing his seatbelt properly which could have protected him from hitting the rear of the front seat. Assistant Coroner for North Staffordshire David James recorded that both Rebecca and Corey died from multiple injuries as a result of a road traffic collision.

Georgina Paraskevas said she was left looking like a monster after having an allergic reaction to what she said was Clairols Nice N Easy product last November. The -year-old claims the dye left her blind for two days and with a scorched scalp. Georgina, from Bristol, believes the reaction was to Paraphenylenediamine- a chemical commonly found in dark hair dyes. The online jewellery store owner is now speaking out about her terrying experience to ensure other people know of the potential risks and are aware of alternatives.  It was honestly the most horric experience of my le, Georgina said. Looking back at the pictures now is just horrible, my head doubled in size and I looked like a monster. It felt horrible and made me feel like I had zero confidence. I hated going out and felt really self-conscious and like people were staring at me. I made the conscious decision to stay inside as I hated going outside and feeling like people were looking at me, it was awful. Georgina was refreshing her hair colour using the Clairol black hair dye on November th - a product shed previously used with no problem - and claims her face and scalp suffered no adverse reaction.  However the following evening during a romantic meal with partner Josh Cox, , she said her head began to feel really hot and itchy. Over the next two days her face slowly started to balloon so panicked Georgina rang  where an operator advised taking an antihistamine to combat the swelling. After visiting her GP the following day and receiving cream to soothe her scorched and blistered skin her face continued to swell so much so her eyelids closed over leaving her unable to see. Georginas desperate mum bakery worker June Kellett, , rang for an ambulance on and was rushed to Southmead Hospital where she was hooked up to a drip. Georgina said: My whole family use Nice N Easy and Ive used it a few times before with no problems. That evening my head was absolutely fine but it was when I went out in the evening the following day my whole head was hot and seriously itchy.  I had blisters on my scalp and the skin on my hairline was really crispy. Later that week the swelling got worse and when my eyes started to swell up and I couldnt open them, thats when I felt really panicked. When I went to the hospital it felt like I had glass in my eyes and I went full-on blind. I couldnt see a thing for two days, it was horrible.  After being discharged from hospital with a antihistamine and steroid prescription, Georgina had to be cared for by her mum and partner as her vision was still affected for a few days. Three months on Georgina now avoids chemical hair dyes and uses coffee granules to tint her brunette locks. Georgina said: Ive started using natural remedies on my hair now and use coffee granules to colour it, it works really well. I want people to be aware that things like this can and do actually happen. A lot of people dont realise whats in hair dye and that it can be really dangerous, Im really lucky and super grateful that it didnt escalate. Since this happened Ive read up on it and I could have permanently lost my eyesight and its scary to see that people have died from it.  Im also a lot more cautious about the things I use on my skin and I just make sure I read everything and make sure it contains natural ingredients. A Clairol spokesperson said: The safety of the people who use our products is our first and most important priority, so we were very concerned to hear about Ms Paraskevas experience with Nicen Easy No Ammonia when we were first made aware of the incident last November. Unfortunately we were unable to get in touch with Ms Paraskeva at the time. Allergic reactions are very rare and hair colourants are extensively researched to ensure they are safe when used as directed and it is imperative patch tests are conducted at least  hours before each colouring occasion. Details of how to perform this test are included with each of our products to help minimise risk to consumers. We remain happy to discuss the matter with Ms Paraskeva should she wish to contact us on our customer helpline.

Taking to Reddit, the unnamed bride shared her side of the story, asking fellow usersshe was an a**hole for not including her friend in the wedding party.She began the post by explaining that shed been friends with two women, Kristy and Erin, since they were all very young. The woman claims she and Erin had grown apart a little, and that she was now closer to Kristy, but soon reveals this isnt the reason she didnt ask Erin to be her bridesmaid. [Kristy] told me that Erins feelings were hurt and then asked me why I didnt include Erin, and I told her the truth.   Erin has MASSIVE breasts. Literally bigger than should be physiologically possible because she has a hormone disorder that caused her breasts to grow to an excessive degree. The bride goes on to explain that initially she had wanted Erin to be a bridesmaid, but thinking about the logistics of getting a dress tailored to fit her friends dimensions had stressed her out. But her bigger worry was being upstaged on her big day by her friends breasts. She continued: Part of me has a fear that Erins presence would be a distraction.   Ive been Erins friend since we were kids. Ive been there through it all, and I have seen how people react to her situation. When people think back on my wedding, I want them to think about how beautul the venue was, or how nice the wedding party looked, ormy fianceacute and I finally getting hitched! I dont want people to remember my wedding for the bridesmaid with the giant boobs. The woman added: I told Kristy these feelings and she more or less told me I was being an a**hole. And honestly I recognize that she might be correct, because Im being selfish... but then I also think thatever theres a time I can be a little selfish then its probably my wedding day.   People who read the post were less than impressed by the brides decision - and were quick to tell her so. One person agreed she was being an a**hole. They said: You specically didnt include someone in your wedding party for a medical problem they cant control. Trade out the issue at hand with needs a wheelchair or has a prosthetic arm and youll see the clear issue.  Another commented: The best way to handle the one bridesmaid needs a dferent sort of dress is to not do matching dresses but instead matching colours. A third added: I would be so hurtsomeone I knew from childhood decided not to include me because I was too skinny or because I had dferent coloured hair or because I had a certain sized breast. After reading all the responses, the bride updated her post admitting she failed to fully comprehend the depth of [her] a**holery. She has promised to sit down with Erin, apologise to her and do whatever she can to recty the situation.

One woman clearly wasnt very interested in brushing up her knowledge on the company she wanted to work for, or wowing the interviewer with her ious skills and qualications. Instead she took a very dferent approach in attempt to put herself in line for the job.  Recruiter Graham Wynn says he was shocked to receive a message from a potential candidate, offering sexual favours infor a receptionist role.Graham, the founder of HR firm Superior People Recruitment, claims to have been sent the highly inappropriate message earlier this week. He shared screenshots of the bizarre conversation online. The conversation begins with Graham offering the unnamed woman a job interview.   He writes: I have received your resume and would like to arrange an interview at level ,  Collins St, Melbourne. If convenient could you please advise best day and time. Thank you. Graham. The woman replies, saying: Hi Graham. Is there anything I can do, specically to you, that would help me get the job  She adds a winking emoji to the end of her message.  A little surprised, Graham attempts to steer the conversation back to a more professional tone. He shoots back: Just to come and meet me and will see what I can do for you. The woman then askshe wants a blow job.Speaking to news.au, Graham said: It was a shock in this day and age and all the things around #MeToo.  I put my phone down and walked away for five minutes, I asked people What do I do  My concern was, is this entrapment to see how I responded  With all this stuff going on. Graham admits he considered just ignoring the message, but colleagues convinced him that no response could be taken as a response. He explained: The rationale was because I didnt say no, I might be open to it. I spoke to a couple of people and they said the best thing to do is respond by saying This is not appropriate.  His actual response read: Refraining from ever sending text like that would help. In general showing unethical traits or an inappropriate sense of humour tends to detract from ones chances of getting a job. According to Graham hes heard nothing back from the woman since - and hes definitely not putting her forward for the job. But this wasnt the first time hes been offered a bribe. The recruiter claims he was once offered , to help someone get a job - but this was the first time someone has propositioned him with sexual favours. He added: We quite often get abusive emails from people who didnt get a job, but this sort of thing  No. I was quite taken aback by it.

Birth photographer Jana Brasil captured the baby completely surrounded by the amniotic fluid which had protected it during the pregnancy. Noahs whole body is engulfed by the sac but he still wiggles and attempts to cry as he is pulled from his mothers body. The sac usually splits just before birth and is more commonly known as a womans waters breaking. His -year-old mother told reporters at the Praia da Costa Hospital in the city of Vila Velha: People all around the world are reposting the photos and looking for us. I saw him being born. They lowered the screen so I could see. I cried a lot. Its an emotion that has no size.  Ms Brasil, who dedicated herself to photographing births as a full-time job three years ago, said: Its indescribable to register that moment. Last year I took photos of babies in the sacs, I have two awards. But nothing like the photo of Noah, it surprised me. I thought I had been through all the emotions, but he pulled a face and did a little pout.   Gynaecologist Rafael Angelo Baggieri said: An en-caul birth occurs when the baby is born without breaking the amniotic sac, in other words, within a little house which shelters it during gestation. Mr Baggieri says the special births occur in every , to , births and do not put the baby or mother at risk. Noah is reportedly still in hospital as Mr Baggieri said the newborn was tired after the birth but the tot is expected to be allowed to go home by the end of the week.  Back in August , a baby was filmed when it was born while still inside the amniotic sac. It is not known where the baby was born or how much he weighed. In the footage the newborn can be seen trying to stretch out asit was still inside its mother.

Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid stole the plane in what he termed a criminal event.The fateful flight took off from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March ,  but vanished without a trace with  crew and passengers on board.Vance, formerly of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told CBC News: It’s not an accident. This was planned and conducted, carried out by one inidual who had control of the aeroplane via his job to have control of the plane. He claimed that the pilot or co-pilot made the decision to take it to a remote part of the ocean and make it disappear forever.   After studying the crash debris, Vance claims the sections of the flap system were positioned downwards and that the plane entered the water at a low speed. He said: I believe with  percent certainty that the aeroplane entered the water in a controlled ditching with the flaps extended. This indicates the pilot had deliberately crashed the aircraft into the sea, he claims. We would call that a controlling ditching into the water, Vance told  Minutes Australia in an interview. The only way that could happen issomeone was flying the aeroplane. In particular,somebody selected the flaps to be in the extended position.  He added: If the flaps were down, then somebody would have had to have put them down, and they had to have put them down intentionally. Vance has put forward the theory in his book MH Mystery Solved which he spent  months researching. The investigator was not part of the official investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau Bureau but teaches the details of the incident to students.   Vances theory has not been universally accepted by those connected to the case. Martin Dolan, former head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, there was not enough evidence to support a murder-suicide conclusion - adding that it was speculation that the flap system was positioned downwards. The evidence is not yet sufficient to draw as firm a conclusion as you appear to have done, he told Minutes.  MHs disappearance has resulted in numerous theories as to its eventual fate, including some which say the plane was switched on autopilot and ran out of fuel.Indonesian fisherman Rusli Khusmin, , claims his crew witnessed the disaster while on an expedition off the coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia.He stated that the stricken plane emitted black smoke as it plunged into the Straight of Malacca in .  Speaking at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur, he said: I saw the plane moving from left to right like a broken kite. There was no noise, just black smoke as a result of fires before it crashed into the water. He swore an oath on the Koran and handed over evidence supporting his claims, including a a GPS navigator which he used to record the coordinates of the spot where he believes tyhe pane went down.

Being on the pitch it certainly felt it could have been a lot more than - at the break.“We dominated the game and that gives you a bit of confidence, especially playing against a Premiership team.“Second half we knew St Mirren were going to come out and have a bit more about them.“They did, but we were dealing with it without any real problems.“Unfortunately for us, Calum Butcher got sent off when it was a - tackle in midfield and could have just been a yellow card.“But he got sent off and then we showed the character to stick in and win the game.“We were playing against a team from the level above us for about  minutes with  men.

They’ve got something like  full-time clubs within a three-hour drive of where they’ve grown up,” he said.“When I was growing up in Adelaide, we had one team and then it was a two-hour flight to the next closest.“Soyou weren’t good enough for that team, you had to work harder and be prepared to sht around.“I know boys here who only want to play for teams in or near Edinburgh – and they can.“Scottish boys are very lucky to have so many clubs and opportunities without having to move.”While he’s no regrets about his nomadic career, McGowan admits the chance to hang around in one place for a prolonged period is growing more attractive.Particularlythat place is here in Scotland, the country he regards as his adopted home.“I do sometimes think I’d love to sign a two or three-year contract somewhere again,” he added.“I would have probably have loved to have stayed on at Hearts for a couple of more seasons and I was enjoying my time at United when I was there but bids came in and were accepted.“And having an Australian passport does open doors in Asia, which is why I’ve ended up there a few times.”If the chance arises to stay at Dundee long-term, he admits it’s something he will give serious thought.He has not, and will not, look that far ahead until he’s helped the Dark Blues out of their current predicament.“A couple of weeks ago moving to Dundee hadn’t even come onto my horizon. Everything has happened quickly and I just want to make sure that, first and foremost, we stay in this league.“When the summer comes,an opportunity arises to stay I will definitely consider it but there is a lot of work to be done between now and then.”He is confident by the end of the season Dundee will be safe.“It’s been really good so far. They are a great bunch of boys and they have made me feel really welcome in the dressing-room.“I’ve kicked most of them when I was playing here in seasons gone by so I know most of them.“There’s a good manager in Jim McIntyre to work under as well. I’m showing my age here but I’ve actually played against him when I was a young player on loan at Ayr from Hearts.“He was coming to the end of his career then and later I played against a couple of his teams once he’d become a manager.“I’m quite close with a couple of players who have played under him and they spoke highly of him and that was more of a factor in coming here.“Having played across the road I also knew how big a club Dundee is. It’s a good club, in a dficult position at the minute but definitely one we can get out of.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c62a1edba50c1.56795146.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee are in a far better place now than when jim mcintyre arrived","story":"Almost four months into his reign as Dundee manager, Jim McIntyre won’t look back on his first match in charge with too much fondness.However, he might just do so with a great deal more satisfaction with how his squad has shaped up in the time since.Despite only picking up two wins and six draws in the  matches under McIntyre, there’s a growing sense of optimism at Dens Park after some encouraging displays since the January transfer window.The opposite can be said of Saturday’s opponents Livingston, the side the Dark Blues faced in Jim’s debut in the dugout.After a lightning-fast start to theirto the Premiership – which peaked with that - thumping of Dundee back in October – Livi’s form has slipped off a clf with last Wednesday’s - draw at Hearts bringing a five-game losing streak to an end.Since leaving Dundee gaffer Jim in no doubt how big a job he had on his hands with that - success at the Tony Macaroni Arena, Gary Holt’s side have only picked up three victories and none since the middle of December.That’s seen them slip from a high of second spot with  points from their first eight games down to ninth with just  picked up from the following  matches.And, though the gap between the sides hasn’t shrunk in those four months, the feeling around both clubs right now couldn’t be more dferent.A massive part of that from Dundee’s point of view is the complete overhaul of the playing squad in the winter transfer window.In fact, there’s a fair chance there won’t be any of the players who featured in the - defeat the last time the Dark Blues travelled to West Lothian this time around.Only three of the  used by Jim that day remain at the club – Elliott Parish, Cammy Kerr and Kenny Miller.Of those, only Miller looks like he could be given a start this time around but even he has a fair bit of competition to overcome with Andrew Nelson on the goal trail and Craig Curran preferred by the manager to lead the line in every match since he arrived at the club at the start of January.A missed penalty in stoppage time in their last run-out won’t have helped veteran Miller’s cause either.Meanwhile, Parish hasn’t featured since that - thumping and doesn’t look like dislodging Seny Dieng as first choice any time soon.The nature of the goals that day, with all four from set-pieces, no doubt led the manager to question his defenders.Parish quickly paid the price by dropping to the bench while three of the back four have been moved on.Andy Boyle is now at Ross County, Ryan Inniss was sent back to Crystal Palace after a nightmare at Palmerston in the Scottish Cup and Calvin Miller has also dropped to the Championship, being picked up by Ayr United on loan from Celtic.Kerr was right-back in October but he’s seen his place taken by new signing James Horsfield in recent games.The former Manchester City kid has looked assured in Kerr’s place and will take some shting before Saturday.The rest of the team have since been shown the exit door – Glen Kamara, Kharl Madianga, Lewis Spence, Sofien Moussa, Benjy Kallman, Roarie Deacon and Adil Nabi have all moved on.Even the side that drew - with Livi at Dens on Boxing Day will be unrecognisable to the one running out this weekend.Whatever side he opts for, Jim knows his team are in a far better place than when he took over – now they have to prove that by getting points on the board."},{"url":null,"title":"ruthless dundee united hammer dundee 7 0 in wee derby","story":"A very strong Dundee United reserves were ruthless at Dens Park as they dispatched a youthful Dundee -

to Robbie Neilson’s Championship outfit.Referee Willie Collum was just yards away from the collision and only deemed the offence worthy of a yellow card.Even though the foul was seen by the referee, under SFA rules compliance officer Clare Whyte could have issued a notice of complaint to the former Dundee full-back had she decided the incident was “exceptional in nature”.A  of three former referees would also have to have given their unanimous agreement McGinn deserved to be sent off for Whyte to proceed with a notice of complaint but it has been decided there was not enough evidence."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c640bc2771117.02764497.jpg ","title":"tom duthie this time the renewed hope at dundee united might not be a false dawn","story":"For the first time in a long time, perhaps even since the dark days of relegation in , there is strong reason for optimism at Dundee United.The one thing that should be stressed about that immediately is it’s still early days.Robbie Neilson’s rebuilt team is only two games in and that means there is some way to go before we can confirm things are definitely on the up at Tannadice.And the truth is that will only come with promotion back to the Premiership.It must also be said there have been other  dawns over the past three years.The arrival of Ray McKinnon and then Csaba Laslo as managers brought hope and even early promise that, after the disastrous   campaign, things were being turned around.In fairness to McKinnon in particular, had he been handed the kind of budget that was made available to the current team boss in the January transfer window, the major problems at the club might well have been sorted and the Tangerines could have been back in the top flight already.Unfortunately for him, those in the boardroom when he was in charge were unable to provide the kind of cash for signings new American owner Mark Ogren has.That, incidentally, is not a criticism of the previous regimes, just an unfortunate fact.Neilson has been lucky he’s got an owner with dollars to spend and the indications so far suggest that owner is just as fortunate that he has a manager who knows how to spend it wisely.Ogren can also consider himself blessed his predecessor in the chairman’s seat at Tannadice, Mike Martin, found not just a good manager, but one who through being out of the game for a period, had taken the time to look at United and form a clear picture of what was needed.Because one thing that’s obvious about the signings made is all have been part of a jigsaw in the manager’s mind.January  didn’t just come round and see Neilson turn his thoughts to what was available. He’d done his homework and, equally importantly, worked out exactly where his squad needed strengthening.That means the right players for the right positions have been found, or so it seems.That’s produced victories over Morton and St Mirren that have lted spirits among Arabs. Rightly so, because both outings have seen impressive work.Of course, with most of those brought in lacking match fitness – that’s usually the major issue with January signings – the good football, has mostly come in the first hour.Players who’ve not had a lot of game time have tired, particularly when reduced to  men at St Mirren. They’ve then shown their ability to manage matches.What the manager also looks to have done well is identy those already in his squad who were good enough to be part of his plans.For all new boys like Peter Pawlett, Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly have deserved the praise they’ve received for their first couple of performances, attackers Pavol Safranko and Nicky Clark have shown they remain big players.After a run of just two goals in nine games, Safranko has found his scoring touch with one in each of the last two outings and has looked the lethal striker he did when he first arrived on loan from Aalborg.Now he’s finally got fully fit, Clark also looks dangerous and there’s no doubt both have benefited from having better players round them in the last two outings.For Neilson and his players the trick is now to keep the good work going. The good news for United fans is, this time, that might just happen."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-pollok-country-park-plans-to-become-more-cycle-friendly","story":"VISITORS to Pollok Country Park are expected to triple when the Burrell Collection reopens at the end of next year."},{"url":null,"title":"lgbt-history-month-council-decision-not-to-fly-pride-flag-is-slammed","story":"A COUNCILLOR has slammed the decision not to fly the Rainbow Flag on Glasgow City Chambers during LGBT History Month."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-mcdonalds-branch-is-serving-up-side-of-classical-music-with-big-macs","story":"A GLASGOW branch of McDonaldrsquos is serving up a side of Bach with its Big Macs in a bid to reduce anti-social behaviour."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potato-day-back-at-the-reidvale-centre","story":"ITS a favourite day in the allotment calendar and the Glasgow Potato Day willthis year."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-reveals-kieran-tierney-wont-make-valencia-game","story":"Tomorrow nights Europa League game against Valencia will come too soon for Kieran Tierney."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-tells-celtic-to-believe-ahead-of-valencia-tie","story":"As tests go, there will be an examination this evening at Celtic Park that will be far more intense than anything  Brendan Rodgersrsquo side have experienced since the turn of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"student-party-flat-in-glasgow-city-centre-allowed-to-keep-licence","story":"THE LANDLORD of a student flat which neighbours claim is an intolerable party zone has been granted a new licence."},{"url":null,"title":"savoy-centre-revamp-art-and-culture-drawing-in-new-generation-of-customers-into-iconic-mall","story":"A PLAN to breathe new le into Glasgows Savoy Centre with boutique stores, cafe bars and contemporary art is drawing in a new generation of customers, according to traders as the next phase of the project is launched."},{"url":null,"title":"10-of-the-most-embarrassing-things-peoples-toddlers-have-said-in-public","story":"KIDS, famously, say the funniest things ndash but sometimes they can leave their parents in thoroughly awkward situations."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-trampoline-park-flip-out-announce-free-entry-for-a-year-giveaway","story":"Trampoline enthusiasts could be jumping for joy after a Glasgow arena announced it has opened applications to bring in ambassadors -

Exodus, the third game in the series inspired by Dmitry Glukhovsky#strilogy, takes Artyom out of the from the tunnels he calls home and out to discover what happened to the rest of the world outside of the Russian capital.With small band of Spartans,Exodus will take you on-board the Aurora as you seek to explore what#s happened to the rest of your country following the nuclear war that devastated the world  years earlier.No corner of the country you explore is untouched by the devastation of the war, with small bands of civilians struggling to make a le in the countryside controlled by mutated creatures, disfigured monsters and violent bandits holding up in the ruins of Civilization.So it#s time to dust off your gas mask, grab your geiger counter and head back into post-apocalyptic wildlands # and as the Russians say, Удачи.  Exodus moves away from the claustrophobic, cramped confines of Moscow#s underground and instead takes you out in the wilds of post-apocalypic Russia.The Aurora # an armoured steam train # serves as your semi-mobile base as you move through the countryside battling to survive. Every stop of the train not only helps progress the story, but also acts as a central hub for exploration of the inidual zones you come across.These large zones feel much bigger than anything previously seen in agame, the well-crafted, well-designed environments are dferent and enticing, populated with a mix of radioactive mutants, ferocious wildle, unforgiving radiation zones, crazy civilians and vicious bandits. Players are able # and actively encouraged # to explore the zones in depth with smaller optional side quests giving an added reason to explore the far corners of the map.Hidden throughout each of the zones are small secure bases which act as a home away from the train, with workbench for crafting and bed to progress the day night cycle which can change the flow of a mission.As you progress through the game, set over the course of an entire calendar year, the seasons and environments change, moving from winter to spring and beyond, with the dynamic weather adding an extra challenge as you battle through blizzards, thunderstorms and mist.Other locations in the wilderness include small villages, bandit camps and ruined bunkers full of Humanimals and other beasts. Whether you choose to attack these at day or night can have a fundamental affect in the way you approach them. Typically there#s more mutants around at night, but you have the added benefit of being able to hide in the shadow#s easier.The design ofExodus means there#s a real choice between taking an area by stealth, slowly but methodically taking out enemies quietly on your way, or going loud with gunfire and grenades to clear an encampment. Not only will the potential outcome change, with rescuing certain hostages allowing earlier access to some items, but your decisions are reflected in the games dialogue. vw, px\"  Evenyou do opt for a full all-out assault on a base, the designers have created the structures in such a way you can skulk in the shadows to plan your move. Regardless of how you approach it, exploration is key to providing vital crafting components to improve your guns, construct ammo and replenish your stocks of medkits.And while the radiation and toxic air is, for the most part gone, there#s still areas where the iconicgas mask is needed # and keeping it in good nick and stocked with filters is vital for those moments.It#s this crafting element that really allows you to personalise your experience ofExodus. Each weapon has countless dferent possible iations, with the ability to mody pretty much every every aspect of your gun and armour to suit your own play style.Crafting and exploration is key toExodus, here#s a few a spoiler-free tips from us. vw, px\"   Exodus builds upon the success of andLast Light, incorporating the key features while bringing a whole new element in the non-linear open world sections.The balance between making the game feel new and fresh, and very clearly still agame and continuing Artyom#s story is very well done. The five years A games spent making it have been very well used.The level design, use of day night cycles and weather has resulted in a very attractive game with clear elements designed to encourage exploration, but never shoe-horning you into a specic play style. vw, px\"  That great level design is accompanied by fantastic immersive audio which is never more apparent while your sneaking your way through the sewers dodging mutants, and staying out of flicking candlelight while you sneak up on a vigilant guard.For fans of the series this is going to be a must pick up follow-up when it launches later this week, for those new to the series i#m going to recommend picking up the remastered double pack first to familiarise yourself with the story. Saying that, gamers who love the horror action combo are going to be a big fan of the very brilliantExodus.Our review is based on the console version ofExodus played on an Xbox One X."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/AR-1-940x529.jpg ","title":"app brings charlie to life","story":"An innovative Aberdeen children’s charity has joined forces with an Aberdeen-based company to bring its beloved mascot to le.Charlie House, which supports children and babies with complex disabilities or le-limiting conditions in the north-east, has launched a new Augmented Realityapp.The charity teamed up with PWK Sales  Marketing, the firm behind the mobile application ROAR, which acts as a tool for businesses and organisations and allows them to bring video content to the screen.Supporters of the charity can download it for free and use it to scan a picture of Charlie Dog in his Big Build outfit, as well as the charity’s logo which can be found on any of their leaflets. vw, px\"   vw, px\"  When scanned, it will bring up videos and information about its Big Build appeal, which launched in November.The appeal is fundraising to build an eight-bedroom specialist support centre set in four acres of ground at Woodend Hospital.Paul Caruana, director at PWK Sales and Marketing, said: “We are absolutely delighted to be supporting Charlie House in any way we can.“Their desire to engage supporters is fantastic.“Charlie House’s AR campaigns are a fantastic example of how it can be used to raise an organisation’s profile and achieve their goals.”It is hoped the movies will help people learn more about the campaign and encourage them to dig deep and donate towards the charity’s vision.Susan Crighton, director of fundraising at Charlie House, said: “As a charity we are always looking for fun and innovative ways to bring home the Charlie House message and keep people updated in regard to our services and progress with our Big Build appeal.“We are very grateful to PWK for their support with this latest technology, which gives people the opportunity to find out more about us as and when they wish, and also the chance to donate at the click of a button.“We look forward to sharing more exclusive video content via the app shortly.”The new centre, which will be the first of its kind in the north-east, will support a range of facilities such as a sensory room, library, spa pool, craft room, teen den, soft play area, therapy room, star room for end-of-le care and bereavement and sensory gardens.Charlie House launches £ million appeal to build specialist care centre for north-east children\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local charlie-house-launches--million-appeal-to-build-specialist-care-centre-for-north-east-children embed # secretiOPqSVv\" data-secret\"iOPqSVv\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Charlie House launches £ million appeal to build specialist care centre for north-east children# # Evening Express\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire health board 22m debt","story":"NewsAyrshire health board £m debt fearNHS Ayrshire  Arran have slashed the amount spent on agency nurses and made other cutbacks but the shortfall is still soaring.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  FEB NewsBoard Chair Martin Cheyne \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshire’s health board is on the verge of racking up a poundmillion debt this year.

The board had already overspent by pound.m up to the end of December. The debt could soar to pound.m by the end of March.

Nursing agency spend has been pared down to poundm for the current financial year. The report said: “ Whilst it may not be possible to completely eradicate the use of agency nurses, a further poundm reduction is on target to be achieved in  .” There has been a dramatic reduction over the last three years with costs paid on external nursing staff droppng by half.

Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Alan McConnell, , admitted the offence when he appeared in Ayr Sherf Court. McConnell was drinking at home with his partner on December  last year. But at some point he left the address, in Prestwick’s Raith Avenue, said depute fiscal Lindzi Bayne. His partner went looking for him at a nearby corner shop, but he had driven off so shop staff contacted police. McConnell’s car was traced to Drongan, and he admitted he had driven there. The charge against him stated he drove on roads between Raith Avenue, Prestwick and Coronation Road, Drongan. A breath test revealed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit in Scotland is  microgrammes. The court heard that McConnell had been ‘just over’ the limit in an earlier drink-driving conviction. Defence lawyer John Gallagher said his client was well aware he could be sent to jail this time. However, he made a plea for a sentence of unpaid work on his client, now of Lane Crescent, Drongan. Sherf John Montgomery told McConnell: “You were driving at five times over the prescribed limit. “If you ever offend again like this, it is inevitable you are going to jail.” He imposed a four-year-driving ban on McConnell, and ordered him to do  hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months. There was another crumb of comfort for McConnell when the sherf refused a Crown motion to seize his car, worth pound.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrCourtsAlcoholDrink-drivingJusticePrestwickAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"retired girvan bank boss admits","story":"NewsRetired Girvan bank boss admits drink-driving offencesNeighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsWilliam Fairbairn is disqualied from the roads for three years\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA retired bank manager was lucky not to be jailed after admitting two drink-driving offences. Neighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Sherf John Montgomery told him: “That would normally mean a custodial sentence. I note your previously unblemished record.” The sherf instead imposed a fine of pound on Fairbairn, and banned him from driving for three years. Depute fiscal Lynda Carnochan described how an anonymous person phoned police on Tuesday afternoon, August , , around .pm. An hour later, police traced a blue Audi car to Rodney Drive in Girvan, and Fairbairn was still in the vehicle. His speech was slurred, said Ms Carnochan. But due to health problems, he struggled to give a breath test.   However, a blood test revealed he had  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood, when the legal limit is  milligrammes. Just two months later, on October , , police on mobile patrol saw Fairbairn driving a Vauxhall Corsa. “They were aware of anonymous reports that he was driving while drinking,” said Ms Carnochan. “They followed him into The Avenue, but he did not stop when police flashed lights at him. He then turned into Rodney Drive, and drove past his own address. However he was eventually stopped.” A breath test was this time successful on Fairbairn. And iot showed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath when the legal limit is  microgrammes. Solicitor Hugh Duncan said Fairbairn had retired from the Bank of Scotland in  on a pension of pound per week.   He used his car to visit his -year-old mother, who is resident in a care home, added the lawyer. “The second matter, within such a short space of time, shows there is an issue with alcohol,” Mr Duncan admitted. “His we tells me his drinking is being curtailed. He was hospitalised with a gallstone, and he suffers from COPD.” Sherf Montgomery fined Fairbairn pound on the first charge, with a  months disqualication. He added an pound fine and a three-year disqualication on the second charge. Fairbairn, of Rodney Drive in Girvan, agreed to pay the pound total within  days. His disqualications will run concurrently, making a total of three years, but the Crown made no move to seize the family cars.

The new safe leave policy, unveiled today, will see staff receive up to  days of absence to gain help and support for themselves and their families. It follows a motion from councillors Laura Brennan-Whitefield and Brian McGinley to adopt the bill, which was unanimously backed by the regions  councillors. The leave will support employees to attend medical appointments and counselling, attend legal proceedings, seek safe housing and visit support agencies. Ms Brennan-Whitefield, SNP member for Ayr North, said South Ayrshire was setting an example by implementing the policy. She told the Ayrshire Post : Domestic abuse can affect anyone at any time - it affects both men and women so this in inclusive regardless of gender or sexual orientation.I think that it was unanimously agreed at full council shows that this issue is now on peoples’ radar. Hazel Bingham, manager of South Ayrshire Womens Aid, added: South Ayrshire Councils decision is a massive step in the right direction for people living with domestic abuse and will, I have no doubt, make a long lasting dference for people at a time when they need help most. I would hope South Ayrshire Councils approach is embraced not just by other local authorities, but by businesses theand breadth of the country, so that safe leave can become a reality for everyone who

between the shortest day and the spring equinox.For Christians it has a particularly special meaning as it was  days after the birth of Jesus and the day when, according to Jewish custom, his grateful parents took him to the temple to give thanks to God.We believe that Jesus is the light of the world who will guide us through our own dark times.Many customs have grown around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to church or temple for a blessing and to give thanks to God for their birth.I have the privilege of being chaplain to two primary schools and while I cannot take the children physically to church or temple, I take each one of them to God every day in my prayers to give thanks for them and ask God#s blessing upon them."},{"url":null,"title":"bubbly bonus at 1930s style choir cafe","story":"At the start of the week, as tickets sold rapidly, final preparations were being made for two shows at Campbeltown Hall,

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"london-based-oil-and-gas-independent-makes-progress-off-scotland","story":"Read more: RockRose hails exciting acquisitionRockrose said the production lives of the Ross and Blake fields north east of Aberdeen are being extended from  to at least  in a development that will allow the firm to book around . million barrels oil equivalentadditional reserves.News of the extensions will be studied with interest in the North Sea oil and gas industry amid the official drive to maximise the economic recovery of the UKrsquos oil and gas resources.RockRose has also made progress with plans to bring finds into development.It said yesterday that plans for the development of the Tain field are progressing and are expected to be submitted to the regulator this year.

I really wanted to do something with the song, so we used it in the trailer.ldquoThen after a while I started thinking the same kind of thoughts we had when we were making Whatever Gets You Through The Night, and that it would be a really interesting way to broaden out the festival beyond astronomy and star-gazing.

A lot of the stories people were coming up with when we were first making that project were about endurance and survival. So it seemed like an interesting thing to explore in this context.The festival, which runs until  February , includes photography exhibitions, film screenings, expert discussion on the cosmos and insight into the inidual benefit of sensory enlightenment through exposure to the dark, with indoor and outdoor venues including the former RAF radar station at Gallan Head, the UKrsquos most north-westerly point.Glasgow-based singer songwriter Emma Pollock said the festivalrsquos appeal lay in its celebration of the winter experience.ldquoItrsquos so dferent to that of the summer on the island or the winter on the mainland, and I think for that reason itrsquos beautul idea, because so many of us just donrsquot get to experience that emptiness or that silence, said the former lead singer of Lanarkshire indie band The Delgados.ldquoThis is essentially a nod to the fact that the contrast between night and day in a rural community is much greater than you ever get living in the city.Ms Pollock will perform her song Dark Skies as part of her performance at An Lanntair, written for the  project as a reflection on growing up in Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway close to the Galloway Forest, one of two Dark Skies Parks in Scotland - the other being in the Cairngorm National Park.She said: ldquoI was thrown back to where I grew up, that emptiness, that rural space which is so much more magnied at night and is such a huge contrast with urban darkness.ldquoIf yoursquore out there and the weather is good, then what you can see is quite incredible.

Why, asked Mr Corbyn, in the circumstances did Mr Grayling proceed with the contract The Labour leader said the advisers were instructed to restrict their due diligence to the ldquoface value of the presentation made by Seaborne Freight, a company with no trading history and that a Freedom of Information request showed the Transport Secretary had ldquobypassed normal procurement rules because a  of experts was denied scrutiny of the deal.But the PM hit back, pointing out how the contract was awarded ldquofollowing commercial, technical and financial assurance at a level in line with the companyrsquos status as a new entrant to the market, carried out not only by senior department officials but also by experienced third-party organisations.She also made clear ldquono money was paid out to Seaborne Freight.However, the Labour leader said the Transport Secretary had ignored warnings about drones regarding airport security, had given a pound. billion contract to Carillion despite warnings about their finances and had overseen the disastrous new rail timetable last year.ldquoHow on earth can the Prime Minister say she has confidence in the Transport Secretary  asked Mr Corbyn.Mrs May insisted Mr Grayling was delivering the biggest rail investment programme since the Victorian era, spending nearly poundbn on improving the railways to deliver better journeys  per cent higher on average every year than under a Labour Government.She then attacked the Labour leaderrsquos own approach to Brexit, saying voters still did not knowbacked a second referendum, a deal or even Brexit.The PM added: ldquoHe prefers ambiguity and playing politics to acting in the national interest.

Under an ambitious development plan, the new Queenrsquos Quay regeneration project in Clydebank will see the installation of MW of water source heat pumps. These will extract warmth from the riverand convert it to energy to supply the pound million complex.This energy project, costing pound million to implement, will heat homes, businesses and some public buildings, including Clydebank Town Hall along with the library, leisure centre and West College Scotland.At its centre is a dedicated energy centre connected to . kilometres of district heating pipe networking the properties. Work on building this is now well underway and initial connections to some of the buildings within the plan are set to go live later this year.The technology works by extracting heat from the water in a similar way to the technique used by a refrigerator to cool its contents. It has existed since the s, works well in the UK climate and can provide heating during the winter, even at temperatures of minus  degrees.The district heating network project, on the site of the former John Brown Shipyard, is being delivered by Vital Energi, a sustainable energy company based in Blackburn, Lancashire.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time. It is up to us to keep fighting. There is parking available in the town so the problem can be overcome.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Why can we tell this is happening  Simple, #because we are at last #seeing the symptoms of decay in its once strict internal discipline.SNP politicians briefing against each other, hostile opposition to official policy, histrionics about BBC bias as a deflection from what’s going wrong with the party’s strategy and policies – and now even the open talk of notNicola Sturgeon should go, but when and where to.I am not making this up. There is no conspiracy. You only need to have been reading, watching or listening to the news to see the SNP is imploding.Firstly, let’s get the Salmond dficulty out the road. Whatever happens with the pending Alex Salmond prosecution it has caused deep isions around competing loyalties within the SNP. Supporters of the ­Salmond or Sturgeon tribes have been briefing against each other. Were Alex Salmond to be cleared of everything, such behaviour will not be forgotten and of course he could be expected to seek re-election. What then for Sturgeon, what then for the SNP  More bitterness, manoeuvring and ision. Let’s not kid ourselves, the SNP will never be the same again, either because of something Alex Salmond might have done, orinnocent, because of the way Nicola Sturgeon has handled the accusations and process – or a mixture of both.Then we have policies like the Car Park Tax. It will be unjust, having no sense in regard to who pays it, who is given a free pass and whether or not they can afford it. The earnings of the driver or the size of car will not ­matter. And, get this, there will be VAT on top of the tax – because the tax will be a bill presented by the employer providing a serviceand so it attracts  per cent VAT on top. £ would become £, or £ would become £.I also have it on good authority that the tax was offered by the SNP to the Greens as a bribe to get their support for the budget – not the other way round. So it is an SNP Car Park Tax that the party cannot escape blame for.No wonder some SNP politicians are openly letting it be known they do not agree with it – it will cost them votes and cost the party seats in Holyrood.That never used to happen, but discipline has gone out of the window under Nicola Sturgeon’s autocratic husband and we rule. Where  in the Western world does so much power rest in a married couple ­holding the posts of party chief executive and Government leader  Not Romania, not the Philippines. Then there have been the protests about an audience member who gave the SNP Culture Secretary a roasting on BBC’s Question Time. The ­programme makers and the BBC have been accused of bias. This is a ­classic deflection of seeking to take away from and avoid discussing the home truths the member of the public made about SNP hypocrisy. Secondly, the man’s politics, religion, allegiances and number of appearances are all irrelevant – are SNP politicians and fellow travellers saying he should not be allowed to speak, that he should have duct tape over his mouth  Is that what an independent Scotland would be like  We also have growing speculation on Nicola Sturgeon being replaced as leader or retiring before she is served notice. Now that’s a new development, partly fuelled by yet another trip to the United States when the real day job of fixing our schools and hospitals is here at home. Is she being lined up for a job at the UN  Who knows, but the fact that I can even ask the question without sounding foolish tells you the SNP is no longer a happy ship.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence top law officer refuses to reveal if nicola sturgeon asked for indyref2 advice","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland#s top law officer has refused to revealNicola Sturgeon has sought his legal advice on holding a second referendum on Scottish independence.Lord Advocate James Wolffe says it would “not be appropriate” even to say whether such advice has been sought in response to Liberal Democrat Mike Rumbles.The MSP has now written to Scotland’s Standards Commissioner calling for an overhaul of parliamentary rulesto force the minister to answer such questions.The refusal has prompted anger because the SNP had been calling for Theresa May to release her legal advice on Brexit.Read more: Nicola Sturgeon: I won’t call a second Scottish independence vote this yearFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to set out her plans for a second vote on Scotland’s future in the UK in the coming weeks.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BROADFORD-PIER-HOUSE-H-FRASER-3.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

faith-based organisation’s new social enterprise shop at Wellington House on the town’s Princes Street. But that is just one aspect of an ambitious multi-phase redevelopment project at the site.“The building had been lying empty for about five years and we are now turning it into a new facility to house everything that the charity does under one roof,” explained Via Wings founder Gail Redmond.Having previously rented premises in the town, the charity worked hard on fundraising projects for several years and received two signicant financial gts which allowed it to buy a building. In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.Discovery of mans body sparks murder probePolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities. Miss Ford, the deputy governor, has instructed them to associate with these prisoners, although some of them have threatened to poision the Price sisters’ food. The families are complainning to the Home Office about the treatment of Mr Price and Mrs Claire Murphy, the girls’ sister, by Miss Ford on their last two visits. This treatment represents a marked worsening of prisoner attitudes from that of the prison staff in Brixton where the girls were during their hunger-strike.”Pay rise for home helpsHOME helps in the Andersonstown areas who were threatening strike action some months ago have just been given a big pay rise.The new rate for the job, which paid only p per hour this time last year, has climbed to p.After the reorganisation of local government services home helps who were working in the Antrim County Council area protested that they were being paid p an hour less than colleagues who were working in the area formerly controlled by Belfast Corporation.In some parts of Andersonstown women working within a hundred yards of each other were being paid at rates which were   p dferent.A pay rationalisation last December by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which now controls the district’s home helps, brought all of the women’s pay up to a standard rate of p per hour.Most of the women work at least ten hours per week, with the average time spent looking after old and housebound people being around  hours.Local Ads in paperPAULA’S Glen Road Shopping CentreLadies and Children’s Outfitters.

It said it represented an increase of p per week for the average household and an average increase of £. per week for businesses.Deputy mayor Cheryl Johnston said: \"Mid and East Antrim Borough Councils approach is always to strike a fair balance between keeping rates as low as possible, with securing existing and attracting new jobs, boosting inward investment and promoting tourism and other key priorities across the borough.\"This is in addition to money council has also already secured for the next  years, at no additional unplanned cost to the ratepayer. \"This includes work on St Patricks Barracks development, The Gobbins phase two, Carrickfergus town centre regeneration, and rollout of broadband services in Carrickfergus and Ballymena.\"Derek McCallan, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, said the overall picture from the council rates was one of \"growth and prudence\".\"Growth, in that councils are investing in high quality services from leisure provision to sustainable job creation, plus all of their regulatory and statutory services like environmental health and planning,\" he added.But he warned the Stormont regional rate could be twice as much as the council average. Mr McCallan said the relatively modest increase was in spite of tens of millions being added to employment costs over the next year. He said this was due to national pay agreements on the National Living Wage and new costs associated with increased powers transferred to councils from government departments.\"It is good that councils are combining growth and efficiency, keeping high-quality services, ambition and affordable costs in equal measure,\" he said.He added that the \"wider decision-taking vacuum\" caused by the Stormont impasse made it dficult for councils to plan properly for the future.\"Councils and taxpayers dont yet know what the Stormont regional rate will be, although it is estimated to be over % - double the average council rate and over twice the rate of inflation,\" he added. \"Frankly, unless the councils are given more resources to deal with an increasing set of expectations, they will be forced to make even more service cuts rather than expect local ratepayers to pay for services which should be supported by the rest of government.\"Belfast City Council, the largest, increased rates by .%.This means domestic ratepayers are paying an average extra p per month, with offices and retail paying an extra £. per month. Ulster Unionist councillor Peter Johnston, who chairs the strategic policy and resources committee at City Hall, said the increase had been kept to a minimum and would be accompanied by the £m City Deal for the region.Alliance had favoured a .% rise, claiming that £, for bonfire ersionary schemes - funding which has been criticised for a lack of transparency - was hiking rates higher than necessary.The biggest increase of .%, set by Derry and Strabane District Council, will see bills rise by around £. per month for householders. The council said the increase represents investment in new services, initiatives and strategic projects linked to a prospective City Deal.Earlier this month the councils lead finance officer Alfie Dallas said there had also been a \"signicant challenge\" with statutory pressures, such as nationally agreed pay awards, pay alignment and pension increases. The \"most challenging and disappointing\" aspect, he said, had been central Government grant cuts.\"The council has lost out on £, of rates support grant since cuts commenced in  , income which could have delivered a further minimum £m of capital investment or investment in other strategic priorities identied in our strategic inclusive growth plan,\" he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37816684.ece/0ffc1/AUTOCROP/w620h342/equal_marriage.jpg","title":"valentines day call for equal marriage to be introduced in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The amendment to the Civil Partnership Bill is being tabled by Conservative peer Lord Hayward.Last year, Secretary of State Karen Bradley told the Commons that the Government would allow a free votethe matter was raised in Westminster, but Baroness Williams opposed the measure when it was first proposed earlier this month.Conor Loughran, LGBT+ officer of the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Irelandsaid the group were appealing to the Minister not to stand in the way \"of the true love of thousands of couples in Northern who just wanted to be treated as equals under the law\".“The Government has to decide whether to stand by Karen Bradley’s public commitment from last year, or to oppose equality for LGBT+ people here. We hope they choose love,” he said.If the amendment passes same-sex marriage would be extended to Northern Ireland, but it would include a clause allowing the Assembly to overturn the decision within six months.Same sex couples are allowed to wed in England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, but it is against the law in Northern Ireland.In November  a majority of MLAs in the Assembly supported the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the measure was blocked by the DUP using a controversial petition of concern.Colum EastwoodAn April  Sky News poll showed % support for marriage equality amongst the Northern Ireland public, with just % opposed.

The mother-of-two died the following year at the age of .Minister Harris offered free smear tests last year amid the fallout from the controversy around the CervicalCheck national cervical screening programme, which saw more than  women who went on to develop cancer receive misreported smear tests indicating a clear result.The move prompted an extra , women to come forward for testing last year.HSE officials told the Oireachtas Health Committee on Wednesday that there was currently a backlog of , smear tests, with reports taking up to  weeks to process.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sinn Fein’s Louise O’Reilly accused Health Minister Simon Harris of not doing his “homework” around a like surge in demand for tests During leaders’ questions in the Dail, Ms O’Reilly told Tanaiste Simon Coveney that the Government should have been better prepared for a spike in demand.“I happen to believe that offering free tests to women who wanted them given the calamity that we witnessed last year in respect of CervicalCheck was the right thing to do,” she said.“But the minister should have ensured that the capacity was there to deliver on that and it is patently clear now that he did not do that.“It is yet another shocking example of the shambles of a system that this minister presides over and it is further evidence that he is not up to the job of leading our health service.”Ms O’Reilly said the argument that the department was unable to predict the level of increased demand was “absolute nonsense”.“This is a relatively recent scandal and I’m sure you’ll recall the public outcry and interest in this subject at the time, so it is little wonder that , women availed of the offer of a free repeat test,” she said.“We all know now about the Jade Goody effect which saw an increase in  of women seeking tests in the wake of the death of this young woman.“It’s no wonder that it happened here, it’s entirely predictable that it would happen here but what we got instead was a soundbite but no work had been done in advance of that.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Tanaiste Simon Coveney said the Government had acted in the best interests of women Mr Coveney acknowledged that the CervicalCheck programme “doesn’t need another controversy”.“It has been a real challenge for the Government, for the Department of Health, for the HSE to deal with what was an extraordinary scandal a little less than a year ago and the Government has responded in a way that had tried to put women’s interests first,” he said.Mr Coveney said that had been Mr Harris’s driving motivation when he offered the free tests.The Tanaiste also insisted that the decision was made with the support of HSE officials, countering claims from Fianna Fail that the minister acted against advice.Health officials also revealed on Wednesday that the switch to HPV testing in Ireland had been further delayed, with a date for its introduction still to be fixed as the HSE focuses on dealing with the smear test backlog.Mr Coveney insisted the HPV test had not been “long fingered”.“It is going to be done properly to ensure that transition works,” he added."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Speaker has provisionally selected the following amendments to todays #BrexitNextSteps motion:  - @jeremycorbyn - @IanBlackfordMP - @Anna_Soubry Read all amendments here: https:t.co GDlfYJLDwL pic QqIUOursK— UK House of CommonsFebruary , .pmLabour MP Yvette Cooperconfirmed she will table an amendment to extend Article  in the event of no deal, which she said was vital to avoid “living in a fantasy world” where no deal could be avoided in another way.Ms Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: “If we don’t do something sensible like this it’s like we’re just all living in a fantasy world in which we talk about alternative arrangements… we say something is going to come along and sort it out and it just doesn’t.“It’s aswe’re all standing around admiring the finery of the Emperor’s new clothes and actually the Emperor is running around stark naked and everyone is laughing at us – or at least they would beit wasn’t so sad.“So I really hope the Government will show some responsibility, I hope they will end up supporting this Bill and I hope they will end up frankly sorting it out even before we get to that point, before it is too late.”.pmTory former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab indicated he may not support the Government in tonight’s vote.Mr Raab said: “We have heard nothing about whetherhas been formally tabled with our EU friends and partners.“I understand it has been raised and discussed with Michel Barnier but has a document, a written version of this, actually been shared  This was the basis on which the Brady amendment was adopted and I think it is a legitimate question to ask.“At the moment I am struggling with the idea of voting for the principled motion but I will listen very carefully to the further assurances ministers will give in winding up because I would rather be in a position of supporting the Government.”.pmEuropean Research Group chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was “highly unlikely” that eurosceptic Tories would vote against the Government in Thursday evening’s votes.Mr Rees-Mogg told ITV News: “Today’s business is not fundamentally important. It is all about where the Government is going.“This is a secondary issue, rather than a primary one, and that is why I think it is highly unlikely people will be voting against this motion.”Could the ERG rebellion be over Jacob Rees-Mogg tells @PaulBrandITV why he thinks its highly unlikely people will be voting against the government Brexit motion: https:t.co qItFAoAL pic QsVvtDaUQ— ITV NewsFebruary , .pm\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Meanwhile in Dublin, Irish premier Leo Varadkar denied being “complacent” over the UK crashing out of the EU.He said: “As we are not certain we have put enormous preparations into making sure that Ireland is as ready as we can be for a no-deal, so this is not complacency, but it is competence.“Ireland certainly wants an orderly Brexit, rather than an disorderly one, the UK does too, so does the EU.“When everybody wants that to happen we will work extremely hard to achieve that but don’t think for a second that is complacency at all. We are making all the preparations for a no-deal.”pm Sir Keir said MPs must now put a “hard stop to running down the clock” and so Labour will back the Yvette Cooper amendment later this month calling for an extension to Article  in the event of no deal being agreed by mid-March.“The simple fact is this, we can’t declare that we are against a no-deal outcome and then do nothing,” he said.“The Government is failing to act so we must act, hence the next step is to ensure a hard stop to running down the clock to ensure that on th February the Prime Minister must either put her deal or allow Parliament to decide what happens next.“I would hope that anyone who genuinely opposes no deal would see that an extension by that date, th March, is unavoidable.”.pmSir Keir Starmer came under pressure from his own party colleagues to confirm holding another referendum on the Brexit deal would now be the next step for Labour.Labour MP Ben Bradshawurged him to act sooner rather than later and said: “The Government has clearly rejected Labour’s offer of a less damaging Brexit and to wait until the end of March to activate our unanimously agreed conference policy in favour of a public vote would be far, far too late.”Sir Keir admitted the Prime Minister had been “non-committal” but said discussions continued, although he refused to disclose details as they were “confidential”.He added: “There must come a point where the options are claried and reduced, then voted upon, and I agree with that proposition and it needs to be done before the end of March.”.pm\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  People’s Vote supporters assemble in Parliament Square .pmWallasey Labour MP Angela Eagle intervened in Sir Keir’s speech, saying: “Is he not as astonished as I am that we have a Prime Minister and a Government that are willing to play this kind of reckless gamble with the future prosperity of our country just to keep their rotten party together.”Sir Keir replied: “Well it is a gamble.”He added: “The plan is to put essentially the same deal back to this House as a binary choice, my deal or no deal. Perhaps with some additional words which the attorneycan say have real signicance, but it will be essentially the same deal. That is not holding your nerve, that is plain reckless and we have to say no.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer addresses MPs .pmSir Keir drew on his past dealings with the PM as he said he did not think Mrs May would take the UK out of the EU without a deal because of her “deep sense of duty”.The former Director of Public Prosecutions said he had worked with Mrs May when she was Home Secretary, saying she had a “deep sense of duty”, adding: “And deep down I do not think that this Prime Minister will take us out of the EU on the th of March, and that’s the basis that we should be having this conversation.”Sir Keir also suggested the likelihood of getting an improved deal which fixes the issues some MPs have with the backstop before we are due to exit the EU are “slim”.The shadow Brexit secretary said: “The simple and painful truth is thisthere had been a viable alternative to the backstop there would never have been a backstop.”.pmShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer urged MPs not to be “fooled” the Prime Minister was continuing to negotiate in earnest.He said: “It is obvious what the Prime Minister is up to – she is pretending to make progress while running down the clock.“A non-update every other week to buy another two weeks of process, inching ever closer to the th March deadline in  days. We should not be fooled.”Shadow Brexit Secretary, @Keir_Starmer is speaking in favour of @jeremycorbyns amendment to the #BrexitNextSteps motion, Amendment .We asked why this amendment has been put forward. pic EcEYfGXuBv— UK House of CommonsFebruary , .pmMr Barclay said the Malthouse Compromise had been “taken forward with the EU” and raised with the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who had “initial concerns”.Tory MP Charlie Elphickeasked   the so-called alternative arrangements were “now Government policy” and asked “will he take a fully worked up proposal to the EU as part of negotiations”.Mr Barclay said: “We have taken it forward with the EU – I have raised it with Michel Barnier and I will be discussing it again with him.”The Malthouse Compromise contains two choices to be offered to the EU: one for how the UK will leave with a deal, and one for how it will leave without. Plan A is similar to the current Withdrawal Agreement, but with changes to the Irish backstop and the implementation period. Plan B assumes that agreement on the Withdrawal Agreement is not possible and creates a “transitional standstill period”.pmReferring to the position of European leaders, Mr Barclay said: “If the EU were to make changes to the backstop, whether that would enable a deal to pass… That is why it’s important a clear message is sent from this House as part of those negotiations. “Colleagues should be in no doubt that the EU will be watching our votes tonight carefully for any sign that our resolve is weakening.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay speaking in the House of Commons .pmMr Barclay said the desire for a deal was shared by many across the EU “because they recognise that no deal is in neither side’s interests. They recognise that no deal is disruptive.”DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds intervened: “Of course we want to get a deal with the EU, but isn’t it the case thatyou take no deal off the table that’s the surest way of ensuring the other side dig in on their current position…  “So those who call for no deal to be taken off the table are actually playing into the hands of the possibility of a no deal.”No news is not always good news. EU still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London on how to break #Brexit impasse. pic vcDlAJeAn— Donald TuskFebruary , .pmOpening the debate the Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said Theresa May must be given more time to take “Parliament’s mandate” for a deal to the EU.He said: “On the th of January a majority of honourable and right honourable members told this House, and our country, that they would support a deal.“But this support was conditional, that members were prepared to compromise on issues but not on the overriding issue of the backstop.”Mr Barclay said today’s motion confirms the Commons’ support for Sir Graham Brady’s amendment which was passed last month, which “in effect gives this Government an instruction which has been taken to our European partners”.He added it is “clear the priority is to address the indefinite nature of the backstop.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  .pm– Amendment A, Labour’s proposal to push Theresa May to either put her Brexit deal to a Commons vote by February  or give Parliament the opportunity to take control of the process.– Amendment I, the SNP push to extend the Article  period.– Amendment E, Tory former minister Anna Soubry, joined by colleagues and MPs from other parties, with a proposal for the Government to publish within seven days the most recent official briefing document, relating to business and trade, on the implications of a no-deal Brexit presented to Cabinet.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town. I am pleased to see our work receive this recognition.During the delegation visit, local authority officials gave presentations on the regeneration of Newcastle and the tourism events strategy for the town.In addition, a representative from the Department for Communities spoke about the Main Street Environmental Improvement Scheme in the resort and the departmentrsquos role in the resortrsquos overall regeneration.At the end of the meeting, delegation members said the examples of successful regeneration they witnessed would prove beneficial to their enquiryrsquos conclusions and eventual recommendations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan actor adds her opposition to disposal plans  ","story":"SHE may have left the Mourne Mountains to pursue an acting career on stage and screen but the Mournes have not left Niamh McGrady.The Castlewellan-born actress has spoken of her horror at recent media stories which claim the Government is looking to the Mournes as a possible location to store nuclear waste.An area of granite bedrock running from Slieve Gullion in Newry to the Mourne is being considered mdash amongst other locations mdash as suitable for an underground disposal facility, according to a preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management , a UK State-owned company.Other locations include an area of rock between Omagh and Cookstown, a location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.Niamh, who has starred in Holby City and The Fall, called for all local people to lend their support as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council passed an emergency motion last week unanimously opposing any future facility.ldquoI am absolutely horried to hear about proposals to host nuclear waste in the Mourne area, said Niamh, who now lives in London.ldquoMourne is an area of outstanding natural beauty, which tourists and local people adore the area alike.ldquoWe do not create nuclear energy here, so why should we be treated as a dumping ground  We will all have to pull together to ensure that this travesty absolutely cannot happen.The Mournes are particularly beloved by the actor, who was born and reared on the Bunkers Hill area of Castlewellan.She married her husband, Dan, close to Spelga Dam just last August and regularly walks in the Mournes when she is home.The  year-old also admitted to often feeling ldquoemotional when it came to Mournes as she was interviewed on the lsquoEamonn Mallie: Face to Face withhelliprsquo series for UTV last night.Apart from giving her viewpoint on her support of the   movement, which calls for equal representation of women in all areas of Hollywood by , Niamh also opened up about her own issues with mental health.She told Mallie: ldquoI have experienced anxiety and depression off and on since my teens. Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

As part of our cultural heritage, looking at our past and history and aspart of our overarching Celtic nations initiative, we want to bring everyone together.Karen added: ldquoMoving forward, the focus is on culture, sports, language, arts and crafts, music and dance.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the resort..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17333834.the-buzz-of-the-farmers-mart/res","title":"outstanding quality at

It will certainly help put Mid and East Antrim on the map, and offer a very inidual experience to lucky newly-weds who want to stand out from the crowd on their special day.Alister Bell, manager at The Gobbins, said: “We are really looking forward to being able to carry out weddings here.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Police probe poisoning of two birds Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so farN.I. child hasnt been seen since Sunday - P.S.N.I. investigatingDerry Girls series two trailer released          ..

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

at worst level for  years","story":"Figures from NHS England show that, during January, just .% of patients were treated or admitted in four hours, against a % target.This meansnearly , patients waited longer than they should, and comes despite lower levels of flu and norovirus than last year.The data shows that , people in January endured very long waits ndash often called trolley waits ndash to be admitted to hospital.After a decision had been taken to admit them, this group waited four hours or more before a ward bed was found for them.The last time the % target ndash which was introduced in  ndash was hit was in July .Nuffield Trust chief economist Professor John Appleby said:ldquoTodayrsquos figures remind us that the NHS is fighting a losing battle in trying to meet its commitments to provide timely healthcare in the face of the pressure it is under.ldquoThere is a risk that we lose sight of these problems as Brexit distracts us, or become numbed as we forget the last time targets were met.ldquoBut this situation has a serious impact on hundreds of thousands of patients, and will be demoralising for many staff.ldquoThe proportion of patients spending more than four hours in AE has risen to .% in January ndash the highest ever in this set of data.ldquoIt looks like the gap between the servicersquos capacity and the care we need from it is widening.He said only two AE departments in England met the four-hour target and attendances have risen by an ldquoastonishing , compared with January last year, at a time in the year when they would usually fall.ldquoLast year, there was widespread concern as we saw trolley waits balloon, yet todayrsquos figures show an even higher level, he said.Royal College of Emergency Medicinepresident, Dr Taj Hassan, said: ldquoSadly the situation afflicting our emergency departments has become seemingly normalised with a lsquochronic crisis modersquothat does not allow staff to deliver the quality of care they would wish and patients should rightly expect.ldquoThe evidence on resultant crowding in departments is clear ndash it adds to the risk of harm to patients leading to excess deaths and disability.ldquoThese figures make clear the true scale of this crisis facing our systems.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said:ldquoAE waiting times are now at their worst level since records began, which is a damning indictment of years of austerity and wider cuts imposed upon health and care services under the Tories.ldquoMinisterial incompetence has left our NHS with chronic shortages of NHS staff with no clear idea of how to sort this out.Patricia Marquis, director of the Royal College of Nursingin England, said of trolley waits:ldquoNo nurse ever wants to leave patients on trolleys in corridors or waiting for hours in an armchair when therersquos no bed.But she added: ldquoItrsquos not just about beds, we also need the nurses to safely staff them.A spokesman for the NHS said thousands more people have been successfully treated in AE within four hours than last year.This is because the total number of attendances has gone up year on year.He said an average , more

strategy at NHS Providers, said demand for care had put signicant strain on trusts and staff but the NHS was treating more patients.She added: ldquoThis is largely down to the work trusts have been doing to improve patient flow and reducing the time patients spend in hospital.ldquoImproved joined-up working with partners in the community and primary care is also helping to support trusts to

Perhaps with some additional words which the attorneycan say have real signicance, but it will be essentially the same deal. That is not holding your nerve, that is plain reckless and we have to say no.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer addresses MPs .pmSir Keir drew on his past dealings with the PM as he said he did not think Mrs May would take the UK out of the EU without a deal because of her ldquodeep sense of duty.The former Director of Public Prosecutions said he had worked with Mrs May when she was Home Secretary, saying she had a ldquodeep sense of duty, adding: ldquoAnd deep down I do not think that this Prime Minister will take us out of the EU on the th of March, and thatrsquos the basis that we should be having this conversation.Sir Keir also suggested the likelihood of getting an improved deal which fixes the issues some MPs have with the backstop before we are due to exit the EU are ldquoslim.The shadow Brexit secretary said: ldquoThe simple and painful truth is thisthere had been a viable alternative to the backstop there would never have been a backstop..pmShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer urged MPs not to be ldquofooled the Prime Minister was continuing to negotiate in earnest.He said: ldquoIt is obvious what the Prime Minister is up to ndash she is pretending to make progress while running down the clock.ldquoA non-update every other week to buy another two weeks of process, inching ever closer to the th March deadline in  days.

Plan A is similar to the current Withdrawal Agreement, but with changes to the Irish backstop and the implementation period. Plan B assumes that agreement on the Withdrawal Agreement is not possible and creates a ldquotransitional standstill period.pmReferring to the position of European leaders, Mr Barclay said: ldquoIf the EU were to make changes to the backstop, whether that would enable a deal to passhellip That is why itrsquos important a clear message is sent from this House as part of those negotiations.ldquoColleagues should be in no doubt that the EU will be watching our votes tonight carefully for any sign that our resolve is weakening.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay speaking in the House of Commons .pmMr Barclay said the desire for a deal was shared by many across the EU ldquobecause they recognise that no deal is in neither sidersquos interests. They recognise that no deal is disruptive.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds intervened: ldquoOf course we want to get a deal with the EU, but isnrsquot it the case thatyou take no deal off the table thatrsquos the surest way of ensuring the other side dig in on their current positionhellip ldquoSo those who call for no deal to be taken off the table are actually playing into the hands of the possibility of a no deal.No news is not always good news.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Sinn Fein spokesperson Sorcha McGeown at the top of William St LurganThe decision, made during a confidential special meeting this week, was split with the SDLP and Sinn Fein voting for council to maintain in-house management of the centre.However the DUP and Ulster Unionists voted for a CoCo arrangement which had been bitterly opposed by staff and unions.This week three unions, GMB, Unite and NIPSA jointly issued a statement condemning the decision and calling on any move towards privatising leisure services to be abandoned.The new leisure centre, which is currently being built, is to replace the current leisure facilities in Lurgan, Portadown and Craigavon.Ms McGeown said: “Unions made representations to all councillors, on behalf of leisure staff, urging us to keep the new leisure centre in-house.“Sinn Féin proposed this option however it was blocked by both the DUP and UUP who voted to out source Craigavon leisure.“This was a vote of no confidence in our staff. Our highly motivated and capable staff have the passion and vision to transform to ensure a high quality service at this rate payer funded setting.“The path the DUP and UUP have taken us down is a dangerous one that will have consequences far more wide reaching than leisure.“There is still time to revisit this decision and I would call on both the DUP and UUP to think again.”Trade union Unite has forged links with other unions such as GMB and NIPSA to fight any privatisation of leisure services in the ABC Council area saying their experience of ’outsourcing’ has been ‘higher prices and reduced staffing’.They have vowed to make retaining in-house management of leisure services a focal point of the forthcoming elections.Fight against privatisation after ‘confidential’ meeting on future of new £m leisure centre Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"They have also started an online petition to keep the management of all the leisure facilities in-house fearing that a ‘CoCo’ option could lead to the privatisation of a £m leisure centre paid for by the rate payer.In a statement Unite said: “Workers at leisure centres operated by the ABC Council learnt with dismay of the decision by the council’s Leisure sub-committee to vote in favour of establishing a CoCo model allowing the outsourcing of the local authority’s leisure services.”Speaking on behalf of his union’s members in the council, Gareth Scott, Regional Officer for Unite, challenged the benefit that outsourcing would offer and pledged the unions would back their members’ campaign to keep leisure services in-house.“Unite the union workplace reps have sought to engage positively with ABC council management in the process of replacing three existing leisure centres – in Craigavon, Lurgan and Portadown – with a single one in Craigavon. Workers have raised a range of revenue-raising proposals including new activities and courses for the new facility. Monday night’s decision saw members of the Ulster Unionist Party joined with the Democratic Unionist Party in voting against the unions’ preferred option which to keep leisure services in-house.“Leisure workers and the wider council workforce are indignant at the likely consequences of this decision – should it be ratied at the next full council meeting.“Unite is committed to overturn this decision.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
