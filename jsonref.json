A nine-figure sum each year – $100million – would add up to $1billion (£760million) over a decade.The couple have yet to say exactly how they will meet their ambition to \u0027become financially independent\u0027. But their unique stellar cachet – blending blue blood and Hollywood royalty – could net them huge amounts.The Queen yesterday made the historic announcement that Harry and Meghan would step back as senior Royals and split their time between Canada and the UK in an agreement to be finalised within days.Her Majesty made clear her deep disappointment at the couple\u0027s decision to quit their Royal duties and said there will be \u0027a transition period\u0027 while the final settlement between the Family and the Duke and Duchess is hammered out."},{"url":null,"title":"Inside Megxit summit Harry talked Queen story","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry in turmoil over cutting his royal links | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE Viscountess Weymouth sends Longleat team Australia help save koalas","story":"Share this article   We Need To Talk About Kevin author Lionel Shriver claims books should be made more readable in order to compete with today\u0027s television shows. \u0027It\u0027s so much easier to sit in front of the TV that, at this stage in the game, it\u0027s probably a good idea to make reading as easy as possible,\u0027 she declares. \u0027I\u0027m not big on obfuscation.

Meghan was barred from dialling in on the meeting from Vancouver. Palace officials said such an idea was rejected because no one knew for sure who else might have been listening in.

The 23-year-old, who had come to Britain to improve her English, suffered catastrophic head injuries when she asked a stranger to take a picture of her against the backdrop of the Seven Sisters cliffs, in East Sussex.         South Korean student Hyewon Kim (pictured above), 23, fell 200 feet to her death from an East Sussex clifftop after jumping in the air for a photograph         The famous landscape around Seven Sister, Seaford (pictured above) where Hyewon fell from She did what countless others had done before her and jumped in the air for a photograph — but lost her footing as she landed and toppled over the edge.When police looked at her mobile phone, which was found lying at the top of the beauty spot, there were six photos that showed her jumping in the air \u0027extremely close\u0027 to the edge.\u0027Her concentration is not on anything other than what she is doing. The expression on her face shows nothing but enjoyment,\u0027 Detective Sergeant Tod Stewart told the inquest into the student\u0027s death.This followed an incident on New Year\u0027s Eve 2016, when a 17-year-old boy from Aldershot, in Hampshire, became the victim of a tragedy that may have been related to taking a selfie on the Paris Metro.

The 41-year-old graphic designer was cycling home after celebrating her mum\u0027s birthday at a pub when she took a smiling selfie. Moments later, she fell off the bike near her home in Isleworth, West London, fracturing her skull. She died days later in hospital.

They were taking selfies from a 100 ft-high wall over the beach when they lost their balance reaching for a dropped mobile phone.An inquest last year into the death of aspiring actress Bethany-Maria Beales, 22, heard she may have been trying to take a photo when she fell to her death from the 19th floor of a luxury apartment block in Moorgate, London.And last year, two young, British holidaymakers — Jayden Dolman, 20, and Daniel Mee, 25 — plunged to their deaths after trying to take a selfie on a cliff in a holiday resort on the Costa Blanca.              Bethany-Maria Beales (left) may have been taking a photo when she fell from a block in Moorgate (right)In 2018, there had been speculation over whether a selfie was to blame for the death of keen runner Andy Lawton, who fell from a cliff at a Welsh beauty spot. Council official Andy, 40, was spotted with his phone on the cliff near Nash Point lighthouse in the Vale of Glamorgan shortly before the tragedy.At an inquest into the death, his father, Barry, told the hearing that his son had \u0027a keen interest in his fitness\u0027 and was \u0027a bugger for taking selfies\u0027.Coroner Graeme Hughes told the inquest in Pontypridd that it was possible Andy might have taken a selfie, although the runner\u0027s family were unlikely ever to find out exactly what happened in the seconds before his death.         Andy Lawton (pictured aboce) enjoyed taking photographs on his regular runs, his father said he \u0027was a bugger for taking selfies\u0027         Nash Point near Llantwit Major in South Wales (pictured above) where it is believed Andy may have taken a selfie Last night, speaking to the Mail, Mr Lawton said it was by no means clear that a selfie had been to blame for his son\u0027s death. But he added: \u0027Having gone to visit Nash Point, I found the area to be very vulnerable to accidents happening and there are very few, if any, signs warning of danger.\u0027There should be warning signs at beauty spots known to be dangerous — and maybe, if people take no notice of the signs, you do need \u0027no-selfie zones\u0027.\u0027Many experts and tourism authorities would concur.The researchers behind the 2018 global study recommended that \u0027no- selfie zones\u0027 should be introduced at dangerous spots in popular tourist areas to make them safer. These would include at the tops of mountains, tall buildings and by lakes.The most common cause of selfie tragedy is drowning, followed by transport accidents and falls.Other causes of selfie-related death listed in the study included wild animals and firearms.In May 2018, a man was mauled to death by a bear in India after trying to take a selfie with it. And in the U.S., selfies with a bear in the background had become such a phenomenon by 2014 that the Forest Service was forced to warn people of the danger of getting too close to the animals.In 2015, five people were gored by bison in Yellowstone National Park in a three-month period. Three of them had been taking photos. \u0027No picture is worth hurting yourself, others or the park,\u0027 visitors to Yellowstone, in Wyoming, are now warned. \u0027Be aware of your surroundings near wildlife, thermal areas, roads or steep cliffs.\u0027In Pamplona, Spain, officials have gone still further. Since 2014, taking selfies has been banned, punishable by a fine, during the city\u0027s controversial bull runs.At a similar event elsewhere in Spain, a 32-year-old man left the spectator area to take a selfie with the charging bulls and was gored, dying in hospital from his wounds.Sometimes, the danger is rather less obvious. In 2016, a man in China was killed in a wildlife park as he tried to take a selfie with a walrus. The businessman had been taking videos and pictures to put on his social media account when the one-and-a-half-ton walrus grabbed him from behind.While women take the most selfies, men, it seems, go to greater extremes for the perfect snap and so account for three-quarters of selfie deaths.The selfie boom has been with us for more than a decade, but really took off when Apple introduced the front-facing camera on its iPhone 4 in 2010.Now, front-facing cameras are commonplace, as are \u0027selfie sticks\u0027 (pictured left) and the filters beloved of the Instageneration.Samsung has predicted that the average millennial will rack up some 25,000 selfies throughout his or her lifetime. But as self-snapped photos have risen in popularity (the word \u0027selfie\u0027 was added to the dictionary in 2013), so has the pressure to capture a picture that will take the internet by storm.So just what is driving this dangerous trend?Social media and celebrity psychologist Dr Arthur Cassidy says an obsession with getting the \u0027perfect picture\u0027 means young selfie-devotees are often oblivious to the risks they are taking.Antics that people pre-social media would never have dreamt of are now commonplace. And it\u0027s all, says Dr Cassidy, about getting a pat on the back from peers.\u0027These young people taking dangerous selfies are looking for attention and validation. They are competing in one-upmanship to see who can get the most \u0027likes\u0027 and the most powerful social media identity in their peer group.\u0027Their end goal is to increase their status in their own mind. They see dangerous pictures as a legitimate pathway to huge success on social media — \u0027look at me.

I know all too well why middle-aged men are tempted into such absurdities and women into different but quite comparable follies of their own.Your mid-40s are the point at which you find yourself saying: \u0027Is this it?\u0027 And at which you hear the doleful answer from the universe: \u0027I\u0027m afraid it is.\u0027Your mid-40s are when you know, beyond even the slimmest of long shots, that you will never sing Born To Run in front of 100,000 screaming fans at Wembley Stadium.It\u0027s the point at which the Booker or Nobel Prizes, the Victoria Cross, the keys to No 10 Downing Street, the screenwriting career, the six-figure salary, the global admiration and esteem, the secure sense of having made a contribution to the world which will both credit and outlive you — all of those things start to slip out of view.It\u0027s not that people your age and older don\u0027t manage all those things. Bruce Springsteen is 70, after all. But the overwhelming majority of them don\u0027t and the ones that do tend to have put the hours in long before this point.In other words, you have left it all a bit late — most likely because you were watching old episodes of Inspector Morse or playing Candy Crush on your smartphone. And now you are where you are, with dwindling reserves of time to accomplish your dreams and dwindling reserves of energy to fulfil them.         It\u0027s not that people your age and older don\u0027t manage all those things. Bruce Springsteen (pictured) is 70, after allYou didn\u0027t paddle hard enough when you had the chance, and now your legs are tired and the waters are moving faster and the temptation to give up is overwhelming.You are defeated. You have measured out your life in coffee spoons, as T.S. Eliot put it, and you are what Ben Elton used to call \u0027a farty\u0027. You\u0027re an ordinary person, just like all those dreary characters you used to think were the supporting cast in your drama. And you are deeply unfree. Like Gulliver on the beach in Lilliput, you are tied to earth by a thousand tiny ropes.There\u0027s all the stuff you own. Where did it come from? Why is it cluttering up your life? The other day I discovered — as someone who does not use an iron from one year to the next — that I own three of the bloody things.If I had the energy, I\u0027d take two or more of them to the dump. But, instead, they join the redundant pasta-maker, the never-used juicer, the jigsaws with missing pieces and the incomplete under-tens chemistry sets in the spare-room gadget graveyard. You spend your time worrying about the mortgage, or the composting collection.Because you have young children, you tidy the kitchen four times a day and it never seems to get actually tidy. You become dismayed by your own toenails. You clean your glasses over and over again because you can\u0027t quite admit that the blurriness is caused by your eyes rather than a smudge of grease on the lens.You bicker with your spouse about paint colours and the hanging of pictures in the loo. And you love your children but they absolutely drive you up the wall.Nobody does what you ask them when you ask them, and everyone wants something from you, all the time. A glass of water. Help with homework. Toast sliced diagonally rather than on the square.Even the cat — which has peed on the sofa for the third time this week and is overdue a visit to the vet from which no traveller returns — is miaowing for another dish of food half an hour after you gave her the last one.Then there\u0027s that glorious moment when you\u0027ve done all your chores and are settling on to the one sofa the cat hasn\u0027t peed on — only for the washing machine to go \u0027Peep! Peep! Peep!\u0027 to tell you to get up and start hanging up the laundry.Plus, obviously, there\u0027s sex. You don\u0027t have as much of it as you once did. You\u0027re not as good at it as you once were. And far fewer people — including your spouse — find the prospect of having it with you especially appealing.Where once the sight of an attractive person sparked lust or excitement in you, now it sparks a twinge of nostalgia.And, ah, vanity: the paunch, the receding hairline, the dimming eyes. Men and women alike are, for the most part, biologically programmed to think that this sort of stuff is important.Our self-esteem is bolstered by the glad eye of another — and as we sink into sexual invisibility, happily coupled up though we may be, that\u0027s a hard thing to get used to.And there\u0027s death. Here you are, closer to the end than you are to the beginning. What used to be an abstract notion has started to feel a bit more real.Your parents — whose immortality used to be a comforting given — may already be gone or they\u0027ll have started looking a bit frail. Perhaps you\u0027re already comparing twinges and minor ailments with your father.You\u0027re turning into your parents and they are turning into old people and you can see all too clearly where this particular plotline leads.But here\u0027s where the rubber meets the proverbial road. In terms of the renowned Kubler-Ross stages of grief, your 40s are when you go through anger, denial, bargaining and depression — all of which are followed by acceptance.You ask \u0027Is this it?\u0027, you get an answer in the affirmative, and you set about learning to love it for what it is rather than resenting it for what it isn\u0027t.You recognise, as your sense of perspective broadens and grows, that nothing matters very much and very little matters at all.That what will both credit and outlive you is, if you have them, those same children you find so overwhelming now.That the esteem of your friends is a steady flame where the glad eye of that hot 20-something is a brief sparkle. And that Nobel Prize wouldn\u0027t have meant a hill of beans anyway.Or that\u0027s the theory. So on the other hand: yippee!Just another 14 months or so and it\u0027ll all be over. I\u0027ll get happier, and happier, and happier — and just as I reach my peak happiness, I\u0027ll drop dead. "},{"url":null,"title":"Victorian era 5 gold coin showing 20 year old Queen leading lion sells record 530 000","story":"Share this article          It depicts Victoria as Una, from the Elizabethan poem The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser. The reverse carries a portrait of the monarch (pictured)The reverse carries a portrait of the monarch.Only 400 of the gold coins, designed by William Wyon, chief engraver at the Royal Mint, were struck.The piece, described as \u0027a truly stellar example of one of Britain\u0027s most iconic and beautiful coins\u0027, was sold by a private collector through US-based Heritage Auctions, in Dallas, Texas.It had been expected to fetch £190,000 but eclipsing the previous record of £421,000 for one of the coins in 2017."},{"url":null,"title":"Railway bosses blasted celebrating expansion Lincolnshire sausages Yorkshire","story":"Share this article          A spokesman for Grantham-based Watkin butchers (pictured) added: \u0027I don\u0027t see how LNER can call a Yorkshire sausage Lincolnshire\u0027A spokesman for Grantham-based Watkin butchers added: \u0027I don\u0027t see how LNER can call a Yorkshire sausage Lincolnshire.\u0027I\u0027m sure it will be tasty but LNER could just call it a Yorkshire sausage.\u0027The rail firm insisted its recipe was for an authentic Lincolnshire sausage – with its unique blend of sage and white pepper – but admitted it was made by a Yorkshire contractor.An application by the Lincolnshire Sausage Association to give Lincolnshire sausages protected status was turned down by the government in 2012."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle visits womens shelter Vancouver","story":"Pick a parka coat by Barbour like MeghanNow sold out - shop similar at John Lewis \u0026amp PartnersIt\u0026#39s chilly over there in Vancouver but Meghan Markle found a way to stay toasty in style thanks to her Barbour parka coat.The classic brand is also favoured by  the likes of the Duchess of Cambridge, and is the ultimate go-to when it comes to nailing an outdoor-chic vibe.A parka coat is a stalwart outerwear choice, offering practical appeal with a nod to nineties cool too.

Lydia’s husband, Sebastián, is an investigative journalist, working to unmask “The Owl”, the leader of an inventively gruesome new narcotics cartel whose grab for power has left the city ravaged and fearful. There are few places on the planet more deadly to be a journalist, and the integrity that attracted Lydia to Sebastián terrifies her now that they have a child – it seems “sanctimonious, selfish”. When Sebastián publishes his exposé, Lydia’s darkest fears come to pass.Jeanine Cummins’s immoderately hyped third novel, American Dirt, opens with blood-sodden terror as The Owl takes revenge: a machine-gun slaughter at a family barbecue. “There are 16 bodies in the backyard, almost everyone Lydia loved in the world.” Only Lydia and her eight-year-old son, Luca, have survived, but there will be no justice, no protection: the police “do nothing, because that’s precisely what the cartel pays them to do”. A distant cousin in Colorado offers the only hope of escape from the cartel’s reach, so Lydia and Luca head for el norte with a threadbare plan to reach the border by freight train (the infamous La Bestia), and then bribe a people smuggler to help them cross the desert to US soil. But The Owl has eyes everywhere.All the elements are in place for a slick cartel thriller: a relentless villain an improbable attraction a clock-ticking chase to safety a conveniently precocious child (Luca has an “intrinsic sense of his position on the globe, like a human GPS, pinging his way through the universe”). But despite its flamboyant and breathless first act, that’s not the novel American Dirt aspires to be.From Theodore Dreiser’s An American Tragedy (1925) to Philip Roth’s American Pastoral (1997), there is a particular kind of literary ambition rooted in titularly American tales – a desire to puncture the soft complacency of American dreams. That dream may be the meritocratic myth of classlessness (Philipp Meyer’s sharp 2009 debut, American Rust) or the pretence of a colour-blind justice system (Tayari Jones’s exceptional 2019 Women’s prize winner, An American Marriage). Cummins’s title is no accident. “I am acutely aware,” she explains in her afterword, “that the people coming to our southern border are not one faceless brown mass, but singular iniduals, with stories and backgrounds and reasons for coming that are unique.” American Dirt is her attempt to “honour the hundreds of thousands of stories we never get to hear” by inhabiting one. But it proves hard to reconcile the novel’s humane intentions with its propulsive, action-movie execution (film rights have already been optioned by the company that produced the Clint Eastwood-directed crime drama The Mule). It’s an activist’s gambit: create a trauma so immense that we cannot help but be swept along by the force of its pathos. It dusts American Dirt with a sheen of sensationalist unreality that obscures rather than illuminates the quotidian terrors that beat at the heart of this book.“This path is only for people who have no choice, no other option, only violence and misery behind you,” a priest warns early on in Lydia and Luca’s journey. “Many will be maimed or injured. Many will die. Many, many of you will be kidnapped, tortured, trafficked or ransomed … every single one of you will be robbed.” American Dirt turns each of these grim prognostications into object lessons, populated with characters who are vectors and vessels for instructional trauma. There is no doubting the wrenching truths – and years of meticulous research on Cummins’s part – that underpin each inhuman ordeal, but there is a fine line between world-building and didacticism, empathy and pity, bearing witness and trauma tourism.American Dirt is at its best when it knowingly explores the insulations, obligations and tenuousness of privilege. When Lydia and Luca beg the assistance of a busload of Pentecostal missionaries from some “faraway cornfield church” in Indiana, only to be met with hesitation. “Are they just drive-by Samaritans?” a local church member asks. “They just want to make pancakes and take selfies with skinny brown children?” Or when Lydia remembers her past self, “peripherally aware of destitution”, distractedly listening to news reports of the caravan of desperate families fleeing Guatemala and Honduras: “All her life she’s pitied those poor people. She’s donated money. She’s wondered with the sort of detached fascination of the comfortable elite, how dire the conditions of their lives must be wherever they came from, that this is the better option.”It matters that American Dirt is willing to ask and answer this ever-urgent question. But the outsized carnage in the novel’s opening pages gives Lydia and Luca an unequivocal answer. Their northward journey is unimpeachably worthy, the political, economic and moral complexities of migration rendered in monochrome. Who could argue with a persecuted mother and child fleeing the grisly hellscape Cummins describes (beheadings, babies hanged from trees, forced self-cannibalisation) for the sanctuary of the US, where the only danger to migrants is the threat of deportation? What emerges is a kind of modern Odyssey with the United States as Ithaca, a gleaming refuge. For a novel that sets out so earnestly to challenge the insular nationalism that leads the US‑Mexico border to feel like some kind of moral boundary, American Dirt may, despite or because of its manifest good intentions, accidentally reinforce the very kind of absolutist reasoning that keeps such myths alive.• American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins is published by Tinder (RRP £14.99).

Wiener was a 25-year-old member of the New York literary establishment’s “assistant class” when she was seduced into the world of startups. In tech, she realised, people her age could be involved in building the future instead of fetching coffee for the quickly receding past.After the web analytics startup, she moved to (the unnamed but barely disguised) open-source platform GitHub, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5bn. Before she burns out and cashes in her stock options, our narrator gets an education in the world as imagined by confident and careless young men, or, as she puts it, “immersion therapy for internalised misogyny”. Wiener’s judgments are cutting and satisfyingly wry. “They engaged with their new home by rating it,” she writes of her fellow tech workers in San Francisco. Incisive commentary on the aesthetic excesses of the successful abound the book’s first half unfolds like an exquisitely curated Tumblr blog, with a scroll of beautifully juxtaposed snapshots of the young, newly wealthy and utterly absurd.It’s in the second half that the book feels frustratingly, and at times startlingly, thin. Wiener’s admission that she did not like to think about the societal implications of her choices is inadequate, and the degree to which aesthetic judgments supersede ethical or moral considerations grows wearying. Her friendship with a billionaire CEO coyly identified as “Patrick” (that would be 31 year-old Patrick Collison, CEO of payments company Stripe) offers an opportunity for her to lay her political cards on the table, but she largely refrains. In 2018, Collison’s company gave more than $400,000 to oppose a local business tax that would have funded services for the city’s homeless. In the book, his gravest transgression is having a birthday party in the woods but not sticking around to camp out.San Francisco’s large homeless population is impossible to ignore. During her tenure at GitHub, Wiener describes observing a homeless man wearing a hooded sweatshirt branded with the company’s logo while on her way to work. (The encounter is not the first time our narrator has remarked on the visual dissonance of a person in poverty wearing tech industry swag.) Wiener admits to feeling “disturbed” by the sight of the beggar for the rest of her commute. “The man seemed like a novelistic apparition, a hallucination,” she writes. She tells a co-worker: “It was the city’s socioeconomic gap personified, I said. It felt even more significant that the man in the light-rail station was black, and not just because San Francisco was losing its black population at a rapid clip. To my knowledge, the company had just two black employees.” The co-worker deems the situation “sad”, then adds: “I wonder whose it was … We’re not supposed to give away the hoodies.”What are we to make of moments such as these? I can see how this might be intended as another cutting observation of the clueless tech bro in his habitat, but 200 pages in, I found myself struggling to swallow bitter ironies about human suffering as eagerly as I had witty remarks about bespoke cocktails and startup office furnishings. The amoral cocoon within which Wiener and the rest of the tech industry reside is pierced with greater frequency as the book proceeds towards the November 2016 election. Discrimination in the workplace, antisemitic trolling, Gamergate, structural racism and sexism become topics of concern, but not ones that she shows particular interest in engaging with. They are instead presented through the same approximate frame as the homeless man in the hoodie – as problems that make Wiener feel uncomfortable opportunities for irony not empathy. When a repository of files related to the debunked anti-Hillary Clinton Pizzagate conspiracy theory spread by the far right shows up on GitHub’s servers, she shrugs. “I didn’t know what I was looking at, and didn’t want to. My teammates seemed to have it under control.”They didn’t have it under control. These days, amid the consequences of the surveillance, harassment campaigns, discrimination, extremism and nihilism that the tech industry fostered, it is natural to wonder how we got here, and why more people haven’t done anything to stop it. It is here, perhaps, that the book feels less like an outsider’s account and more like an insider’s unwitting confession. • Uncanny Valley is published by 4th Estate (£16.99).

Chief executive, Willie Walsh, accused Virgin of “wanting the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline”.Any government loan would also attract EU commission scrutiny for breaching state aid. However, the EU approved loans made last September by the German government to save Condor, a subsidiary of the Thomas Cook Group, when the UK allowed its sister airline to go bust.The Treasury will also face the wrath of environmental groups after it announced a review of APD, a tax that adds £26 per passenger to all Flybe domestic return flights, to “ensure regional connectivity is strengthened while meeting the UK’s climate change commitments to meet net zero by 2050”.An additional review has been promised to examine how else regional transport connectivity can be improved. The Treasury said: “In light of these discussions Flybe have confirmed they will continue to operate as normal, preserving flights to airports such as Southampton, Belfast and Birmingham.”Air passenger duty, or APD, is a British tax on aviation, introduced in 1994. It is charged on each passenger on flights departing from the UK, and set according to the distance of their final destination and the class of travel.Destinations are grouped into two bands, above and below 2,000 miles from London, and charged at three rates – effectively for economy class, premium economy and businessfirst-class seats. All short-haul flights to Europe, including domestic, are charged in the same band, rising from £13 in economy to £78 in first class. A long-haul first-class flight now attracts APD of £528.Airlines have long lobbied against the tax, particularly after the rates were doubled in 2007.Flybe has argued that it is especially hard hit as the tax only applies to UK departures, and is therefore applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at £26, while an international return flight from the UK to Moscow pays £13 in APD.Long-haul flights from Northern Ireland are exempt from APD, as well as departures from remote parts of Scotland.The chancellor, Sajid Javid, said: “I welcome Flybe’s confirmation that they will continue to operate as normal, safeguarding jobs in UK and ensuring flights continue to serve communities across the whole of the UK.“The reviews we are announcing today will help level up our economy. They will ensure that regional connections not only continue but flourish in the years to come – so that every nation and region can fulfil its potential.”Lucien Farrell, chairman of Connect Airways – the parent company of Flybe – said: “We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government’s recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK. As a result, the shareholder consortium has committed to keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives.”Flybe’s chief executive, Mark Anderson, said: “Flybe is made up of an incredible team of people, serving millions of loyal customers who rely on the vital regional connectivity that we provide. This is a positive outcome for the UK.”The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said his department would undertake “an urgent review into how we can level up the country by strengthening regional connectivity”. He said it would look at all the options to ensure airports could continue to play an important role in driving economic growth.The government had been urged by MPs, unions and business to save Flybe, which serves almost two in five domestic UK flights and employs more than 2,000 people. It carries 8.5 million passengers a year between 56 airports across the UK and mainland Europe, and is the main airline at regional airports including Belfast, Southampton and its Exeter base.The deal came after a day when the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged that the government was “working very hard to do what we can” for Flybe and avert a further airline collapse so soon after Thomas Cook. The Conservatives had committed in their manifesto to improve regional connectivity.The pilots union, Balpa, welcomed the news. General secretary Brian Strutton said: “This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe.“The government is to be applauded for stepping up to the plate to help one of the few remaining independent UK airlines and a vital one at that.”The company’s pleas for help to survive the winter came less than a year after it was taken over by a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic, with Stobart and Cyrus Capital, after posting recurring losses of around £20m per year.Flybe has long struggled financially, and the fall of sterling since the 2016 EU referendum has piled additional pressure on UK airlines, with major costs such as fuel incurred in US dollars.The airline has argued it is particularly hard-hit by APD, which is charged on each passenger on a flight taking off in the UK. While all short-haul economy flights, including domestic, are charged at the same rate – £13 – the tax is applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return Flybe flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at £26, while the duty on a Glasgow to Malaga return costs half that.Potential moves to ease APD were condemned by environmental groups. The MEP for South West England – a constituency that includes Flybe’s Exeter home – Molly Scott Cato of the Green party, said it was “absurd to suggest that we should provide a further boost to the aviation industry”. She highlighted that routes deemed socially necessary could be subsidised under EU rules – Flybe’s Newquay to London route is already funded with state aid.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: “The government cannot claim to be a global leader on tackling the climate emergency one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel cheaper the next. Cutting the cost of domestic flights while allowing train fares to rise is the exact opposite of what we need if we’re to cut climate-wrecking emissions from transport.”Flybe flights were operating as normal on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae0be9c6ad34b352c42f168e95a5bdc20b87534f/0_149_4134_2482/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=774f0de6bddf81bdeb810ac53d85950b","title":"the case for making low tech dumb cities instead of smart ones","story":"High-tech smart cities promise efficiency by monitoring everything from bins to bridges. But what if we ditched the data and embraced ancient technology instead? Cities is concluding with ‘The case for ...”, a series of opinion pieces exploring options for radical urban change. Read our editor’s farewell hereEver since smartphones hooked us with their limitless possibilities and dopamine hits, mayors and city bureaucrats can’t get enough of the notion of smart-washing their cities. It makes them sound dynamic and attractive to business. What’s not to love about whizzkids streamlining your responsibilities for running services, optimising efficiency and keeping citizens safe into a bunch of fun apps?There’s no concrete definition of a smart city, but high-tech versions promise to use cameras and sensors to monitor everyone and everything, from bins to bridges, and use the resulting data to help the city run smoothly. One high-profile proposal by Google’s sister company, Sidewalk Labs, to give 12 acres of Toronto a smart makeover is facing a massive backlash. In September, an independent report called the plans “frustratingly abstract” in turn US tech investor Roger McNamee warned Google can’t be trusted with such data, calling the project “surveillance capitalism”.There are practical considerations, too, as Shoshanna Saxe of the University of Toronto has highlighted. Smart cities, she wrote in the New York Times in July, “will be exceedingly complex to manage, with all sorts of unpredictable vulnerabilities”. Tech products age fast: what happens when the sensors fail? And can cities afford expensive new teams of tech staff, as well as keeping the ground workers they’ll still need? “If smart data identifies a road that needs paving,” she writes, “it still needs people to show up with asphalt and a steamroller.”Saxe pithily calls for redirecting some of our energy toward building “excellent dumb cities.” She’s not anti-technology, it’s just that she thinks smart cities may be unnecessary. “For many of our challenges, we don’t need new technologies or new ideas we need the will, foresight and courage to use the best of the old ideas,” she says.Saxe is right. In fact, she could go further. There’s old, and then there’s old – and for urban landscapes increasingly vulnerable to floods, adverse weather, carbon overload, choking pollution and an unhealthy disconnect between humans and nature, there’s a strong case for looking beyond old technologies to ancient technologies.It is eminently possible to weave ancient knowledge of how to live symbiotically with nature into how we shape the cities of the future, before this wisdom is lost forever. We can rewild our urban landscapes, and apply low-tech ecological solutions to drainage, wastewater processing, flood survival, local agriculture and pollution that have worked for indigenous peoples for thousands of years, with no need for electronic sensors, computer servers or extra IT support.This month, Julia Watson, a lecturer in urban design at Harvard and Columbia Universities, published her book Lo-Tek: Design by Radical Indigenism. It’s the result of more than 20 years of travelling to research the original smart settlements, through an architect’s lens.She visited the Ma’dan people in Iraq, who weave buildings and floating islands from reeds the Zuni people in New Mexico, who create “waffle gardens” to capture, store and manipulate water for desert crop farming and the subak rice terraces of Bali. Watson walked the living tree-root bridges that can withstand adverse weather better than any human-made structure, and that allow the Khasi hill tribe in Northern India to travel between villages during the monsoon floods.“There are so many different ways you can rewild cities,” says Watson – and it’s not just a case of plonking an ancient system in a city, but rather adapting complex ecosystems for different types of places with their own unique requirements. Take a current proposal she is working on for the high-rise city of Shenzhen on the Pearl River estuary by Hong Kong. It was once a fishing village, then a textile town, “and it just skyrocketed,” says Watson. “All of the fishponds and polders and dykes and wetlands that absorb all the water in that delta landscape are being erased. So the city is developing in a way that’s erasing the indigenous resilience in the landscape.”But you don’t have to erase to go forwards, she says. “You can leapfrog and embed local intelligence, using a nature-based traditional Chinese technology that’s climate resilient, ecologically resilient and culturally resilient. And we can make beautiful urban spaces with them as well.”Kongjian Yu, a design professor at Peking University, agrees with this philosophy. Known as the “sponge cities” architect, Yu creates urban landscapes in China that passively absorb rainwater, using permeable pavements, green roofs and terraced wetland parks that flood during monsoon. If wetlands are situated upriver of the buildings, they will flood before the water reaches the city proper.The parks have brought fish and birds back to cities, says Yu, “and people love it.” The projects, he says, “are performing well, and many of them have been tested for over 10 years, and can certainly be replicable in other parts of the world.” In fact, this month he has visited Bangladesh, ironically, “helping their ‘smart city’ project,” where he has convinced “the minister in charge that nature is smart, and our ancient wisdom tells us how to live with nature in a smart way.” Copenhagen, too, has opted for a dumb – or, as local planners call it, “a green and blue” – solution to their increasing flood risks: namely, a series of parks that can become lakes during storms. The city estimated they would cost a third less than building levees and new sewers, and come with the added ecological benefits of rewilding. An abandoned military site was cleaned up in 2010 and rewilded into a nature reserve and common for grazing animals, the Amager Nature Centre – a vast park with not only happy people meandering and cycling around but insects, protected amphibians, rare birds and deer.But dumb cities can be even smarter than that. Not only can functioning wetlands defend cities against floods and restore nature, they can clean wastewater. And they can do it more efficiently than sewage-treatment works – all while absorbing a whole lot of carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and methane, and creating a fishing industry and fertile farmland. No water, energy, treatment chemicals or fish feed required. The world’s largest such system, in east Kolkata in India, involves the city’s sewage feeding the fish. It saves the city approximately $22m (£17m) a year in running costs for a waste treatment plant. The water can be used for irrigation, saving a further £500,000 in water and fertiliser costs. And it enables much of the city’s food to be grown locally.Or, as waters rise globally, we can learn from Makoko, the incredible city-on-stilts in Lagos that is home to 80,000 residents. Its “floating school” – sustainable and solar-fuelled – has captured the world’s imagination. Rotterdam has already introduced a floating forest and farm, and is developing plans for a sustainable floating city.As for dumb transport, there can be no doubt that walking or cycling are superior to car travel over short urban distances: zero pollution, zero carbon emissions, free exercise. A few token green walls and trees won’t do it. Watson calls for a focus on permaculture: self-sustaining ecosystems. “If it’s an urban forest,” she says, “perhaps it’s in the centre of the city, perhaps it’s on the periphery, or it could be an interior environment – an atrium designed to have a complex ecosystem that’s also agriculturally productive.”There are hundreds of nature-based technologies that have never been explored. For example, Watson envisions stunning urban uses for the living root bridges of the Khasi hill tribe: “They could be grown to reduce the urban heat island effect by increasing canopy cover along streets, with roots trained into trusses that integrate with the architecture of the street – in essence, removing the distinction between tree and building.” They could even retain their original use during seasonal floods – living, physical bridges over the water. In April, Greta Thunberg and  columnist George Monbiot made a rallying video calling for more trees and wetlands and plant cover to tackle the climate crisis. Cities can be part of this push. The idea of smart cities is born of what Watson describes as “the same human superiority-complex that thinks nature should be controlled”. What’s missing is symbiosis. “Life on Earth is based upon symbiosis,” Watson says. She suggests we replace the saying “survival of the fittest” with “survival of the most symbiotic”.

There are few stages that look so white as a Democratic debate in Iowa in early 2020.It wasn’t just the recent departures of every leading candidate of color in this contest to unseat our orange president.Somehow the makeup caked on the faces of the surviving contenders made them look even more white than the frozen cornfields they watch through the windows of their campaign buses all day.Until one moment, after an hour of earnest discussion about national security, when the blood suddenly rushed into Bernie Sanders’ cheeks.On the face of it, Bernie’s face was burning from the much-anticipated discussion of a pre-election conversation with his former friend and current rival Elizabeth Warren. Did he really say a woman couldn’t win an election? Did she really fib about what he’d said behind closed doors?For two candidates who like to talk about structural, radical change, this sounded like a good old-fashioned dispute about spilling beer in a crowded bar. The beverage was just an excuse for a beating.Only Sanders got suckered into a different dispute – not about women, but about winning. Specifically, whether he could beat an incumbent Republican. And more specifically, whether he could add up.“Look at the men on this stage,” Warren said. “Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women. Amy and me. And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me.”Until this point, Sanders had given a fine account of himself, denying any sexist sentiment, pledging his support for the ultimate nominee, and even praising Hillary Clinton for winning the popular vote. Which hasn’t exactly been his most popular talking point for the last three years.But that wasn’t enough for Sanders, who decided to dispute Warren’s real attack: that none of them had beaten a Republican for 30 years. Sanders insisted he had, back in 1990, done just that.Warren smiled and pretended to do the math. Sanders grew flustered as it dawned on everyone that he thought 1990 must be more recent than three long decades. His cheeks flushed brightly and he spluttered his way through an emphatically delivered diatribe about nothing in particular.So much of Tuesday’s debate was a matter of time travel. In the contest to fire a 73-year-old president, a 78-year-old socialist senator spent the first half hour of a TV debate arguing with a 77-year-old former vice-president about their respective decisions to vote on the war in Iraq 17 years ago.There are voters preparing to caucus in Iowa who were not born when these old men were first arguing about weapons of mass destruction.The ghosts of that time stalked the stage in Des Moines at the final debate before the fateful first votes in this election year.The last time Democratic voters picked a nominee to run against a gun-slinging Republican president, they faced a stark choice between a leftist populist and a centrist snoozebag. After dating Howard Dean, they married John Kerry. Almost two decades later, the Democratic voters of Iowa face a similar choice between the rabble-rousers and the comfy pair of slippers.Just three weeks from the first votes of the 2020 cycle, the final debate revolved around four candidates vying for two slots: Elizabeth Warren versus Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg versus Joe Biden.It’s good manners to point out that there were two other candidates on stage: an entirely respectable senator, Amy Klobuchar, and an entirely forgettable rich white guy, Tom Steyer. Klobuchar had some fine moments urging the lefties to face up to reality. Steyer weirded out the nation by turning dramatically to look into the camera every time he piped up.But with so little time left for Iowa to enjoy its brief moment of global importance, let’s not waste this blip in the historical record. For the Iowa polls suggest we’re looking at a four-way race, bunched up in the high-teens or early-20s, depending on how many new voters the pollsters think will show up to caucus.For most of the night, the steady establishment hands were only too happy to look down on the chaos and lament the lack of credibility at a time when Tehran looks more restrained than Trump. They didn’t even bother to point out when Sanders confused George W Bush and Donald Trump when he was talking about support for the Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen.Back in 2004, it was the capture of Saddam Hussein that marked the moment when Dean began his collapse and Kerry rose up from the depths of his dismal polling to take the nomination.Back then, Joe Biden was a surrogate for Kerry, testifying to his friend’s national security experience and leadership skills. Today, Biden’s strongest moments on stage were when he was silent. His defense for his vote on the war in Iraq was that Barack Obama hired him. His best argument for the boldness of his healthcare plan was that Obamacare was a big effing deal.It is still true that the idea of Joe Biden is rather more impressive than the reality. And much of that notional Biden is built around his old friend Barack.This is a big moment for the tiny state of Iowa (population: 3.2 million), so the final Iowa debate was held in a room that appeared no bigger than your average display of butter sculpture. As the candidates scribbled their pre-debate notes in the minutes before the debate began, CNN’s pundits were close enough to the stage that they hushed themselves for fear of disturbing the candidate’s brainwaves.But in just a few weeks, Iowans will do something very big: award winning-tickets to no more than two of the Democrats on stage this week.In the meantime, they and the rest of the nation will be consumed by the impeachment of a very stable genius.Even more than an Elizabeth Warren debate trap, the trial will bring a rush of blood to this contest. Judging from this final pre-Iowa debate, it sorely needs the defibrillator that Donald Trump represents. Democrats are looking for a candidate to beat Trump even more than a candidate with the best plans for healthcare reform.As the impeachment trial sinks into an Iraq-style quagmire, Iowa’s Democrats may start to look at this race anew. The winner may well be the candidate who knows how to turn that moment of Trumpian triumph into a rallying cry for disappointed Democrats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f796da93264206701cb23ce7ed5d84982486fd83/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd171590b87f3a7dced37fc041638dc","title":"trust politics public mistrust labour","story":"We’ve all heard it. I’ve heard it – on doorsteps, in the back of cabs and in cafes. “Politicians,” people will say, “you’re all the same.” Now, I balk at anyone who compares me to the blond baboon who is our current prime minister, but there is no doubt that trust in politics – and in politicians – is at an all-time low.People just don’t believe we’ll deliver what we say we will. They don’t believe we want to listen or to understand their lives. And they don’t believe we are able to do much to make their lives better. Lots of factors have contributed to this: the expenses scandal, the rise of fake news and, let’s be honest, too many politicians either telling lies (don’t get me started on the £350m for the NHS) or not giving a straight answer when they’re asked a straight question.A decade of Tory austerity has stripped away vital services and hollowed out high streets. Millions of people have simply lost faith in the ability of government to make their lives better. They’re angry about decisions made far away by people they don’t think have much of a clue about the stresses and strains of their daily lives.All of us in the Labour party should be concerned about the growing gap between voters and the politicians they elect to represent them. Not just because we’re democrats but because listening to people, being bothered about their lives and being rooted in their communities, is the only way we will win again. Our challenge is to restore both trust in Labour as a party of government and trust in democracy as the best means of delivering what the public wants. It’s a big task – but here are six things I would do to achieve this.First, we need to be honest, even if that’s uncomfortable. On social care we need to be clear that looking after the elderly will require people to contribute more in tax. When we’re asked whether immigration is too high, instead of fudging a response, let’s say what we think: no, it isn’t. The public isn’t stupid – people know when we’re trying to avoid saying something.Second, we need a new approach in order to reach decisions on long-term challenges. On climate breakdown, we need a plan that involves the public much more. Citizens’ assemblies are increasingly used around the world to build consensus. In Ireland, they helped pave the way for the historic changes on abortion, while in Poland they improved government response to major flooding. It’s time we used them here.Third, we need to recognise that people want more control over how decisions that affect their local communities are made. The UK is one of the most centralised countries in the world. While a step in the right direction, the “northern powerhouse” risks bypassing my region of the West Midlands and focusing solely on a handful of cities. Lisa Nandy is absolutely right that we need to devolve economic power away from Westminster and learn from what Labour councils around the country are doing.Fourth, we need people to feel their votes count. Under our first-past-the-post system, almost half of those who voted (14.5 million people) did so for a candidate who lost. Many who live in “safe” seats have given up on voting altogether. So, as well as long overdue Lords reform, we need to reform our electoral system so that parliament better reflects votes cast.Fifth, people should be automatically enrolled on the electoral register, as happens in countries such as Sweden and Finland. Inidual voter registration has meant millions of people are either not registered or are registered at the wrong address. If we reduce the minimum voting age to 16, as we should, then people could be auto-registered when they are issued with a national insurance card.Finally, if people are to trust our electoral process, we urgently need to combat fake news during campaigns. Apart from Twitter, which has banned political adverts, the social media giants aren’t stepping up. The result? A recent study found that nine in 10 of the Tories’ online ads during the election contained “misleading” information. We need a new public body to regulate online political ads, funded by a levy on the cost of purchasing the advertising space.These ideas might sound radical to some, but to me they’re just common sense. Unless we modernise the way we do politics, more and more people will give up on the idea that their participation is meaningful. Politics can change the world – but only if we change politics.• Jess Phillips is the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley and party leadership candidate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b3905ee327285d9cbf6d47b9140cd0eb13d714/0_3_507_304/master/507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7315d03345acfcea266b6adb59d2d5e7","title":"after the sleep economy whats next to be monetised breathing","story":"Here’s a wakeup call: the latest hip startup selling new-fangled mattresses and performance pyjamas won’t fix people’s sleep problemsFor a moment, I thought 2019 might have been the year the startup bubble finally burst. Lyft and Uber both had disappointing initial public offerings (IPOs). Then WeWork, the office-space startup whose CEO once proudly proclaimed that the company’s multibillion-dollar valuation was “more based on our energy and spirituality than it is on a multiple of revenue”, spectacularly imploded. The company had to cancel going public as it became clear that “spirituality” didn’t compensate for burning through cash without a clear path to profitability.Around the same time, Peloton, the connected exercise bike company that promised investors it sold “happiness” and was “so much more than a bike”, had a disastrous IPO. It seems the market cottoned on to the fact that it was actually just a bike company after all – and a loss-making one at that.These high-profile flops prompted worried speculation about another dotcom crash. Had the era of hip startups being declared “innovative disruptors” and being valued at dizzying amounts despite making zero money finally come to an end? Were startups going to have to start (shock horror!) demonstrating a viable business model instead of relying on vague buzzwords?Apparently not, if Casper is anything to go by. On Friday, the direct-to-consumer mattress company filed paperwork to go public. It makes for pretty familiar reading: the trendy New York-based company loses a ton of money, has a ton of competitors and might never be profitable. But none of that matters, you see, because Casper isn’t just a mattress company. Nope, it is a self-described “pioneer of the Sleep Economy” with a mission to “awaken the potential of a well-rested world” by branching out from the mattresses business and flogging such things as performance pyjamas and cannabidiol sleep supplements.“We believe that sleep consists of more than just the act of sleeping,” Casper notes in its filing, “and instead, includes the entire set of human behaviours that  from bedtime to wake-up and affect sleep quality – this is what we refer to as the Sleep Arc.” And what everyone else might refer to as a Corporate Crescent of Crap or a Startup Semicircle of Spin.But perhaps I’m being unfair. While Casper’s filing may be full of nonsense, it is bang-on about the fact that, as it puts it, sleep has entered the “wellness equation” and become big business. Over the past decade, sleep has gone from being a basic human need to the ultimate status symbol. Gone are the days when people would brag about being too busy to sleep now the rich and famous brag about getting seven hours of sleep and still managing to fit in a 4am wakeup, a demanding job and a hectic social life. The likes of Prince Harry wear high-tech sleep-tracking rings so they can quantify exactly how much REM they had and optimise their snoozing schedules accordingly. You can now buy everything from luxury stays at yogic sleep retreats to $600 robots that promise to cuddle you to sleep.The sleep economy, which Casper values at $432bn (£333bn), is no joke. It is, however, built on an insidious lie. The reason most people aren’t sleeping well isn’t down to their mattress or their pyjamas it’s down to social issues such as precarious employment, long hours and noise pollution. Forget the sleep arc – there’s a massive sleep gap studies show that the less money you make, the less sleep you are likely to get. Unfortunately, you are less likely to rake in the venture capital money trying to solve sleep inequality than you are flogging new-fangled mattresses.Anyway, now that sleep has been thoroughly monetised, one does have to wonder: what’s next? The defecation deficit? The breathing economy? One thing’s for certain, capitalism never rests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0ef02e29a147ebef98c14bf789b6406a596b086/0_88_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0eb465af25ceec4e5e9accf25f5aded","title":"tresspass trap law land travelling people rights","story":"Every government of the past 30 years has promised freedom, and every government has taken it away. The general “freedom” they proclaim turns out to mean freedom for billionaires, the City of London, and the tax-avoiding, labour-exploiting, planet-poisoning chancers whose liberty is our captivity. Meanwhile, through further restrictions on housing, benefits, immigration, protest and dissent, they have snatched freedom from those who need it most.Boris Johnson’s government intends to sustain this ignoble tradition. Its consultation document on unauthorised encampments proposes to criminalise the lives of some of Britain’s most vulnerable and persecuted groups. By enabling the police to confiscate the homes of “anyone whom they suspect to be trespassing on land with the purpose of residing on it”, Gypsies, Roma and Travellers will be left with nowhere to stop.But when you examine the proposals more closely, you begin to realise that they don’t stop at the persecution of travelling peoples. The way the questions are framed could enable the government to go much further than the official purpose of the consultation, potentially launching one of the most severe restrictions on general freedom in the modern era.The consultation is everything such exercises are not supposed to be. It is confusing and heavily slanted. It is pitched in such a way that, however you might answer the questions, you are forced to agree with a profoundly illiberal idea.For example, the first question asks: “To what extent do you agree or disagree that knowingly entering land without the landowner’s permission should only be made a criminal offence if it is for the purpose of residing on it?”It’s a perfect trap. If you agree, you consent to the curtailment of the traditional rights and lives of Roma and Travellers. If you disagree, you consent to the criminalisation of something much wider, which, throughout English history has been a civil matter: trespass on land.Is this the intention? To sneak in, under the cloak of a populist attack on a small minority, the criminalisation of walking on the great majority of England’s land? We have a parliament in which, in both houses, landowners are massively over-represented. We have a wider political and economic system in which ancient, landed power still carries immense weight. There is nothing some landowners would like more than to set the police on those who dare to venture into their vast estates. And there is nothing that tells us more clearly that freedom for one is captivity for another.The harder you look, the more disguised powers appear to be lodged in this consultation. Even if new trespass laws are aimed only at those residing on land, they will affect not only Gypsies, Roma and Travellers, but also rough sleepers. David Cameron’s government criminalised squatting in empty homes. This too was previously a civil matter. Thousands of homeless people found themselves on the wrong side of the law. Some have been imprisoned for using property abandoned by its owners. Johnson’s government would do the same to people living in tents or bivvy bags. There will be nowhere to turn.Any new laws are also likely to be used against protesters. We’ve seen how previous legislation – such as the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act, the 2000 Terrorism Act and the 2005 Serious Organised Crime and Police Act – has been immediately deployed against peaceful protest, in some cases after the government promised that it would not be used for this purpose. In view of the statements this week by the home secretary, Priti Patel, attempting to justify Extinction Rebellion’s temporary inclusion on a list of extremist ideologies, we cannot trust her to protect our rights to dissent. People seeking to reside on land for the purposes of protest, as anti-fracking and anti-roads campaigners have done to great effect, are likely to be criminalised from the outset.But in casting the illiberal net so wide, the government might accidentally have created a coalition. Rather than allowing Roma, Travellers and homeless people to be picked off, all those of us who fear the criminalisation of trespass should join forces with them, protecting their rights while we defend our own. In responding to the consultation, which closes on 4 March, we should refuse to be trapped in the government’s framing. Instead of agreeing or disagreeing with its proposals, we should state under every confusing question that we reject all attempts to criminalise trespass.History shows that attacks on general freedoms often begin with an attack on the freedom of a minority. It teaches us that we should never allow a government to ide and rule. An attack on one is an attack on all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

On Tuesday, it looked like something might have changed.The decision by the private equity giant BlackRock – the world’s biggest fund manager – to exit investments that “present a high sustainability-related risk” has been welcomed by environmentalists as a significant moment in the battle to reshape the relationship between money and the climate crisis.The move is “a remarkable breakthrough”, the leading climate science writer Bill McKibben told the . “The activists who made this happen get the afternoon off to celebrate.“This is the biggest pot of money in the world and until today, its leaders have refused to acknowledge the biggest thing happening on the planet – the accelerating rise in temperature. So it indicates that the facts on the ground of the climate crisis are so grave that no one can turn away, and that activist pressure has reached a point that even the richest companies are not immune.”In two letters on Monday, the BlackRock boss, Larry Fink, announced: “The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance” and henceforth the company would est $500m from coal-related businesses.The announcement called on “every company, not just energy firms, to rethink their carbon footprints”.BlackRock, which holds $7tn in assets, has come under intense pressure to reform the funds it offers investors.“Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,” Fink wrote, adding that new funds would allow clients to avoid investments in companies that may be adding to climate change.The firm said it doubled to 150 the number of exchange-traded funds it offers that address social, environmental or governance issues.In November, climate activists protested outside of BlackRock’s London offices, dumping ashes to signify the Amazon fires while Extinction Rebellion, the global environmental movement, described BlackRock as the world’s top investor in deforestation and coal. Fink himself has received letters from members of Congress urging action, while BlackRock was named as an investor with one of the worst voting records on climate issues by Ceres, a not-for-profit watchdog that pushes financial firms to consider sustainability.The pressure for change has come from within the world of finance as well as outside. Last month, Mark Carney, the outgoing head of the Bank of England, warned that pension funds risk seeing their assets become worthless unless companies rapidly rise to the challenge of the climate crisis.McKibben, who last year published a devastating report in the New Yorker titled Money Is the Oxygen on Which the Fire of Global Warming Burns and who is part of a campaign to force companies including Goldman Sachs, Chase Bank and BlackRock to reform their investments, said environmentalists would now need to keep the pressure up.“The steps BlackRock is taking are baby steps, and we will have to watch and push hard for them to begin striding at the pace we need to go. But in some sense, the first step is often the hardest,” McKibben said.He urged the company to go further. Its decision to est $500m from coal-related businesses, for instance, is not the same as esting from larger and far more polluting oil and gas industries.“Coal is part of the problem, but not the biggest part of the problem – oil and gas are,” McKibben said. “Fink made noises that natural gas is part of the solution but it’s not. That’s old thinking, and we’ll push them hard on that, but at least we’ve reached the point that they’ve realized they have a role in dealing with the climate crisis.”But perhaps the largest change is BlackRock’s apparent willingness to use its considerable shareholder power to demand climate action – a power it has in the past demurred from using in favor of direct company consultations.A report last year by the Washington DC-based Majority Action and the Climate Majority Project claimed that BlackRock had voted overwhelmingly against key climate resolutions at energy companies, including ExxonMobil.Had BlackRock and Vanguard not torpedoed these investor efforts, at least 16 climate-critical shareholder resolutions at S\u0026ampP 500 companies would have received majority support in 2019, representing a significant corporate shift on climate, the report claimed.“We have the largest investment stewardship team in the industry and engage with companies even in the absence of shareholder proposals,” BlackRock said in a statement to the  at the time. But, it warned, “it would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal’s impact”.In Tuesday’s statement, that position appeared to be shifting from last year when it said that “recent extreme weather events” and “the implications for investment portfolios – stemming from a rising frequency and intensity of such events – have been notoriously hard for investors to grasp”.No longer. Now BlackRock’s CEO writes that company directors should be held accountable “where we feel companies and boards are not producing effective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues”. He added that “the company voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 different companies” last year.There are still worries for environmentalists. Majority Action’s Eli Kasargod-Staub warned that subtlety in BlackRock’s language calling for companies to improve disclosure on “integrating and reporting on sustainability” is not the same as calling for immediate action.“BlackRock has the power to be going to corporate directors and saying: ‘Either you commit to the science-based targets of the Paris climate agreement and align you operations, governance, political spending, lobby and trade association activities to achieve that target or we will vote against you and your directors,’” Kasargod-Staub said.“But that’s not what BlackRock said – they said they’re calling on companies to enhance their disclosures around climate risks and their plans around those risks,” he added.“Think about how passive that sentence is, then think about the behavior of ExxonMobil or Marathon petroleum, who through their capital expenditures and policy influence have actively undermined our ability to protect long-term investors and meet the goals of the Paris agreement,” said Kasargod-Staub.Whether Blackrock is now going to side with activist resolutions on sustainability remains to be seen during shareholder season, McKibben said, but he warned against anticipating a shift by fossil-fuel energy producers to become carbon-neutral.“I don’t think the big oil companies are capable of changing, though I’d like to be proved wrong,” he said. “The job is basically to starve them and reduce their ability to continue expanding.”Still, McKibben said: “For all of us that have been campaigning for years around climate finances, this is an historic moment. From today, it’s going to be harder to go sink of load of money in Exxon, because the biggest financial firm in the world has said, ‘Huh, there’s something to this climate stuff. Better pay attention.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67cb1c0c26388552ed543ebd016554750db234b/2883_53_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16d432242390131402be15c610592db0","title":"scientists cite parasite factor in beard attractiveness debate","story":"Whether facial hair boosts men’s pulling power or is a turnoff has long been a matter of contentionPrince Harry sports one, Justin Trudeau has recently grown one, and Brian Blessed’s is almost its own being. But are beards attractive? As the old adage goes: “Depends on the man, depends on the beard.”Now researchers have found there might be another factor: whether a potential partner fears there might be something living in it.Scientists say women who are more repulsed by the idea of lice, fleas, ticks and other such ectoparasites, are less likely to find beards attractive, possibly because such pests might carry diseases.“This is likely to be the case for the majority of our evolutionary past,” said Anthony Lee, of the University of Stirling, a co-author of the study. “In modern times, with increased grooming and overall better hygiene, this link between hairiness and carrying ectoparasites may no longer exist, but the evolved tendency may still persist.”Whether facial hair boosts men’s pulling power or is a turnoff has long been a matter of contention, but previous research from the same team found women rate bearded men as a better bet for a long-term relationship.Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, researchers from the University of Queensland, and the University of Stirling, report how they asked 919 predominantly heterosexual women to rate the attractiveness of three male faces for both potential short and long-term relationships.Each face was shown with and without a beard, and with five levels of “masculinity” – while beardedness is seen as masculine, the trait includes a range of other features such as a thick jawline, a prominent brow, and deeply set narrow eyes.The women also completed a set of questionnaires which measured attitudes including their revulsion in response to parasites that live on the body, and their desire to become pregnant.In general, women deemed masculine-style faces more attractive than feminised ones. The same trend was seen for both short and long-term relationships and whether bearded or not, although differences in attractiveness relating to masculinity were less pronounced for bearded men – possibly, the team say, because the beard can hide some “unattractive” features.For each level of masculinity, bearded men were deemed more attractive than clean shaven men, a result found for both short-term and, to a slightly greater degree, long-term relationships.But not everyone was drawn to a hairy face. Among other results, the team found that women who had higher levels of disgust for ectoparasites found beards less attractive, although the reverse was true for those concerned about picking up harmful bacteria or viruses.While the latter link was weak, the team write: “This could be interpreted as evidence that facial hair is preferred as a marker of health among women with high pathogen concerns, or that facial hair masks areas of the face that would communicate ill health.”Whether participants were aware of a small study published last year that suggested men’s beards might harbour more germs than dog fur was unclear.The study has limitations: all of the male faces were of northern European ethnicity, and most of the women were white and lived in the US. It is also not clear whether the results would hold for gay men, or women of other sexual orientations.Lee said that despite the findings men should stick with what they were most comfortable with. “I wouldn’t base the decision to grow a beard on the results of a single study,” he said.Christopher Watkins, from Abertay University, Dundee, an expert in social judgments of faces, who was not involved in the study, suggested further studies might explore whether men chose to cultivate facial hair if it were deemed sexier.The authors of the study reveal that previous research into London fashions suggested facial hair was more common when there were more men than women available in the marriage market.“The research advances work on inidual differences in women’s attractiveness judgments, in this case, by focusing on facial cues that men can easily change – beards – in addition to how ‘masculine’ his face looks,” said Watkins. “Findings such as this might raise interesting questions in future about the uptake and nature of male grooming practices for example if different men from different cultures or regions are responsive to the high or low ‘value’ of a beard in making a good first impression.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bf097747fdae4c9d70dbaaee1c275198851ad0d/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d60b45911e28f9eea9b0069ae6e0fc6","title":"taste test unholy kiwi pizza is a tangy pleasant surprise","story":"A widely shared image of a kiwifruit pizza has caused mass consternation online – but it tastes much better than it looks“I wouldn’t even serve this to my worst enemy,” our waiter says with a smile as he plonks the pizza down on the table.“This” is a kiwifruit pizza, an innovation that horrified the internet this week after an image of one was shared widely on Reddit and then picked up by the press. One user labelled it “unholy”, while others expressed curiosity.That’s why we are at Al Taglio pizzeria in Surry Hills, Sydney. The restaurant has won multiple accolades for its creative, modern approach to pizza making. Although chef Enrico Sgarbossa is a little sceptical, he was prepared to experiment with kiwi, just for us. We showed him a photograph, but asked him to use the fruit however he thought would work best.It turns out the original kiwi pizza was also an off-menu order. On 5 January Stellan Johansson took some kiwifruit to his village pizzeria in Skottorps in the south of Sweden and requested they use it in a pizza for him.“The men in the pizzeria thought I was mad,” Johansson tells  Australia. But they did it anyway. He snapped a picture for his Facebook page, then “someone took my photo and now it’s everywhere”.Johansson isn’t annoyed by the coverage, some of which falsely states the pizza was available on the menu of a restaurant in Denmark. “I think it’s funny.”Johansson had been given 10kg of kiwis by his brother, who grows them, for Christmas. He was looking for ways to use the produce up. He’d been baking them in cakes, and even deep-frying them, but suggests the pizza was one of his better innovations. “I like it ... My children also liked it.”Back in Sydney, two of my coworkers are debating the pizza’s visual merits. “Aesthetically it’s beautiful because of the contrasting colour scheme,” one observes. The second counters: “It’s unappealing to see kiwi on a pizza.” But, says the first, “If you didn’t know what kiwi was, maybe you’d just look at it and say ‘Oh a beautiful piece of green on my pizza.’”Our version is neat and aspirational – like a smoothie bowl on cheat day. An oval sliver of raw, jade-green kiwi is placed at the centre of each pizza slice. It’s a departure from Johansson’s original, with its liberally scattered slices, the sight of which was enough to trigger a trypophobia I never knew I had. Perhaps that’s why social media users were so enthralled by it.We take our bites and learn what Johansson already knew – kiwifruit on pizza is actually pretty good. At first, the tart sweetness cuts through the ham and cheese, like pineapple might. But the texture is softer, with less contrast. “It doesn’t ruin the pizza, which is what I expected it to do,” says one of my dining companions. The other, a former pastry chef, likens it to a slice of oxheart tomato. “It gives that tang and freshness. I think if you were to eat this blindfolded you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.”In total, seven  Australia staffers tried the pizza, and in our unscientific poll, every pineapple pizza fan said they would eat kiwi pizza again. Some even preferred it.Even our pizza chef believes that with a bit more finessing, kiwifruit could have its place. Last year, Sgarbossa – who approaches pizza with an academic zeal – trialled a fruity “bruschetta pizza” that featured finely diced tomato, rockmelon and red onion on a focaccia-style base, topped with burrata. It was one of the restaurant’s most popular styles that summer.Sgarbossa teaches pizza-making workshops, and tells his students there’s no such thing as a good or bad topping. It comes down to common sense, good ingredients and personal taste. The kiwi pizza we tried worked because it placed kiwi on top of an already-good pizza. The base, high-quality ham and mozzarella did most of the heavy lifting. The fruit was just there for a touch of tang and novelty. Sure, the seeds were slightly gritty – but if you get the balance right, pizzas can have a little kiwi.

She continued to achieve success at club level and her final major trophy, the Supercoppa Italiana, was won with Juventus less than three months ago.“I very much feel like I’m ending on a high, with a sense that there’s not much more I can do in the game,” she told the . “There is nothing that could motivate me to keep playing for another two or three years aside from a love of the game, which is something I can express through other avenues.“I spoke a lot to Karen Carney and Claire Rafferty, two mates and former England internationals who retired at the end of last season.

Food for the love of health.” In Ouagadougou’s first plant-based restaurant, there are no knives on the tables.The place is full of regular customers who greet Christine Tapsoba, the owner, like an old friend. But it wasn’t always like this. “At the start, it wasn’t easy. People thought it was weird, they didn’t know how we could make food without using meat,” she says. “Some days, we could open the restaurant and sell nothing.”In the years since Nasa opened in 2004, her clientele has grown exponentially, drawn in initially by giveaways of her popular barbecued tofu skewers.Plant-based diets have also spread across the west, with vegan restaurants and products seeing meteoric rises in sales. But global meat consumption is still increasing, with burgeoning urban middle classes across Africa, Asia and Latin America powering the demand.Across Africa, a growing number of plant-based restaurants are following in Tapsoba’s footsteps in response to health and environmental challenges. Happy Cow, an app that helps vegetarians and vegans find places to eat around the world, lists more than 900 restaurants with vegan options across Africa. More than half of these were added in the past two years. Thirty fully vegan restaurants have been listed since the start of 2018.South Africa has been at the forefront of this push, with veganism booming in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Cities such as Nairobi in Kenya, and Accra in Ghana, today boast a dozen meat-free restaurants. In Dakar, the Senegalese capital, upmarket seaside restaurants are quickly adding salad bowls and aubergine sandwiches to their otherwise meat- and fish-filled menus.The continent is also at the forefront of some of the challenges veganism hopes to ease. Conditions such as heart disease and cancer have now overtaken infectious diseases such as cholera and measles to become the biggest drain on Africa’s economies, according to the World Health Organization. Much of the continent is already feeling the effects of the climate crisis – a common reason for reducing meat intake – as more regular and unpredictable droughts and floods wreak havoc for farmers and regularly claim lives.Many of its advocates, however, argue that veganism is not a new trend – it is simply a return to traditional African diets. “I particularly think it’s important to spread veganism around Africa because it originated in Africa,” says Nicola Kagoro, a chef working in South Africa and Zimbabwe. “Our ancestors didn’t eat as much meat.” Kagoro founded the African Vegan on a Budget movement to show Africans vegan diets can be affordable and filling. She also cooks for female vegan armed rangers group the Akashinga, who fight elephant poaching in Zimbabwe.In research on the world’s healthiest diets, published in the Lancet in 2015, west African countries such as Mali, Chad, Senegal and Sierra Leone, which boasted diets rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, topped the list. Ethiopian cuisine relies on plant-based foods such as the sourdough flatbread injera, lentils and beans, and many of the country’s Orthodox Christians take part in regular fasts during which meals are served without any animal products.Still, the trend is slow to take hold. “It’s hard to spread the vegan practice around Africa because Africans love their meat,” says Kagoro, who is known as Chef Cola. “The challenge is because Africans think meat is a form of showing wealth.”With Nasa, Tapsoba helps the few Burkinabe vegetarians of Ouagadougou navigate an often difficult path to a meat-free life. “When a vegetarian is here and I am told they struggle to find something to eat, immediately I rise up to help them,” she says. And with patience, free tofu, and a growing awareness of the consequences of meaty diets, she hopes to convince others to join her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/951751a0c4cd75dfee1938b2f1b9360a19527de9/654_605_6200_3721/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=106f67f984865dbf34701823f7e5360f","title":"out of nowhere i felt really sad readers on how they felt at 47","story":"We asked you to tell us how happy you were at 47 after a study found that people were, on average, most unhappy at the age of 47.2I have always been extremely happy. When I was 45 my husband left me quite suddenly after 25 years of what I thought was a very happy life. I was miserable but I could cope. After six days I met my current husband and apart from being unhappy I was also in love. But then I turned 47 and two or three months later I felt so miserable. Just out of nowhere I felt really really sad. I had no money, I missed my children, and my work wasn’t going well. It feels like I had to cross some sort of swamp to get to the other side. Now, at the age of 54, I am happy and have been for quite a while. Manon Sikkel, 54, writer, AmsterdamIt’s weird timing that I’m seeing your article now, at the age 47, as I do feel like I’m questioning a lot about life these days. I think a lot about the difference between how I thought life would be and the reality. I became a parent quite late and, to be honest, I do struggle with the practicalities of looking after a pre-schooler. I do love my little girl, but it can often feel like hard work at a time of life when used to think I’d feel less pressured and stressed.Work-wise, I became self-employed two years ago. Partly because of childcare issues, but also because, working in marketing, I could sense myself losing touch with the latest developments – especially on the social media side. Obviously family time is important and we all need to earn a living, but I suppose this is an age where I think I haven’t achieved what I might have wanted (although I was never totally sure what this was). Or I at least wonder what else I could be doing that might be more fulfilling. It is a funny time of life for me, and I don’t want to moan as I do appreciate there’s not actually anything wrong with my life. Hopefully things will change as my daughter becomes more self-reliant and I can enjoy time with her more. And while I must admit to feeling quite lost now, I think my 50s could be OK. Matt, BirminghamSorry to go against the findings but I would say that my 40s in general were probably the best period of my life. My life changed a lot during my 20s and 30s and I had a lot of fun as a performing musician, but having young kids and being very involved with their development was very satisfying. The relationship with my partner was good and I reached a kind of maturity whilst still retaining most of my energy and enthusiasm for life. I would definitely say I was far more satisfied with life at 47 than I was at 57. Andrew Jarman, 63, works in event production, Seville, SpainI worry a lot: about money, my kids’ happiness, my marriage, and family issues. I miss my dad who passed away I have insomnia and I’m not sure where my life is going. I feel so tired that at the end of the day I go to bed before the kids! So I don’t really do anything for me, not anything that I can sustain, anyway, because I’m either with the children, at work or too tireddon’t have enough money. I am unhappy about my home: my husband is a bit of a hoarder and we have a very small house. I hate the clutter as it stresses me out and makes me sad, but he won’t throw anything away. It upsets me. Katie, 47, SydneyI’ll be 47 in a couple of weeks. Physically I’m in good shape and quite active. However, over the past nine months or so my mental health has been very poor. I’ve had quite severe depression and anxiety attacks. I’ve tried therapy (not very helpful) and am on antidepressants, but feel like I’m really only just keeping my head above water. I haven’t been off work but cannot focus and feel like I’m just going through the motions when I’m there. I don’t socialise as much as I used to, and don’t tend to enjoy it when I do. There are a number of factors that have combined to hit me hard at this age.I have a job with lots of responsibilities and stress a parent with dementia and poor health and the various stresses and strains that go with being a husband and parent. I’m lucky enough not to have financial worries, but even so I find managing my personal finances stressful. Most of all, though, it’s that classic midlife realisation that I’ve spent more than 20 years in a career that I don’t really enjoy or find meaningful or fulfilling, and that the clock is ticking if I want to spend the rest of my life doing things that I love and are important to me. John, LondonAt the time I felt there must be more – that the monotony of existence couldn’t go on. Then, a few weeks before my 47 birthday, my husband announced he was having an affair with his secretary. He packed his things and left. I was pretty cross about him throwing away a 25-year relationship in such a cliched fashion – but a part of me was singing with joy. This was my ‘out’. The following year wasn’t a pleasant one, and I did grieve for what I lost – but I love my new life. I have a home, children, friends, a resurrected career and no miserable old git asking how much my boots cost. I have become much happier. Naomi, OxfordshireGhastly. I was working 12 hours a day to support my family, with a house husband who hated staying at home to look after our two children but couldn’t find a well-paid job. This put a terrible strain on our marriage. I discovered later that he spent his day online in sex chat rooms. I felt unattractive, exhausted from my three-hour commute every day into London, and a bad mother. Not surprisingly, at 49 things came to a head. I ended up having an affair and we orced when I was 51.I put on weight through excessive drinking and a lack of exercise. I saw the first symptoms of menopause and had difficulty sleeping. In bed at night I had the sensation of ants crawling over my legs. There were some very dark times when I had massive rows with my husband and walked out of the house, only returning after five or six hours. I have now been in a loving and secure relationship for nine years. Gemma, DorsetI’m generally happier than I’ve ever been. No one told me middle age was so enjoyable. I know who I am and still have enough energy to enjoy life. I have sod all to prove to anyone at this age so I can enjoy my dreadfully dreary and mundane hobbies and activities without fear of what people might think. It’s great. Only down side is my job which is down to a lack of skilled positions in my area - but the pay is ok and it keeps me out of trouble. David, CarlisleAt the age of 46.5 I feel quite drained by the daily routine which involves managing a household, two kids and a full-time job. I have come to realise that over the last year or so, every holiday I take is followed by an utmost struggle to fit back into the usual pattern and this has induced me to reflect on the quality of life I live and my expectations. I am obviously a little unsatisfied with how I live even though I have a safe job, I am not overworked, and I have two lovely kids who are great fun and who have happy lives. I feel like life is slipping by and I am not really embracing it wholeheartedly as I am overwhelmed by daily chores. I basically wake up longing for the moment when at the end of the day will go back to bed!

Other areas of the creative industry might have slowed down, but people are still going to gigs.”Calvi, who is an ambassador for Independent Venue Week, added that investment in venues should be seen as a long-term project, which allows talent to develop. “There might only be 150 people in the room at the time at those early gigs, but those artists could go anywhere from there,” she said. “Playing smaller venues was instrumental for me to becoming the artist I am now.”In February 2018, the UK’s first ever music venue census found that a third of Britain’s small venues outside London were struggling, with respondents identifying rampant property development and soaring business rates as main issues. The value of Britain’s live music sector hit a record £1.1bn in the same year, with 11.2 million music tourists – those travelling from overseas or within the UK to get to live events.The founder of Independent Venue Week, Sybil Bell, said small gig venues had been “taken for granted” and that although things had improved recently in some locations, the sector in general needed more assistance from government.“People have sat up and said we need to support venues,” she said. “They’re being squeezed by increased business rates, while rents are spiralling out of control and are unrealistic for many.”Bell added that despite challenges there were also “green shoots” and “innovative venues”, with concert halls ersifying and providing community activities such as mental health services and spoken-word nights. She said: “There’s a misconception that a lot of venues are dark and dingy, and it’s really not the case – a lot has happened on a local level.”Ben Lovett of Mumford \u0026amp Sons has warned that the UK’s music industry risks falling behind its European competitors unless action is taken to support smaller venues. “When you go to Sweden it’s not like those artists are doing it without the support of public and private investment,” he told the  in November. “The infrastructure is really strong. If we do all those things we could have many more artists like Skepta and Stormzy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612650666facab7182722f84dc82f8f4aa58003d/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dfa16e20635af3ef17e4a7f3a02684","title":"why did former nissan boss carlos ghosn choose a life on the run podcast","story":"The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan’s most respected business people.

Almost as if the producers didn’t quite trust the prime minister not to back out of his first televised interview since the election and wanted to shame him into going through with it. Or at the very least to have footage of him sneaking out a rear window.But for once Boris Johnson was as good as his word and shortly after 8am the BBC’s Dan Walker found himself face to face with a figure who looked as if he had just tumbled out of bed.Let’s start with Iran, said Walker. Boris clasped his knees tightly, trying desperately to remember exactly where Iran was and why it was important. It was quite early in the morning. Then it came to him. “I don’t want a military conflict,” he said hesitantly. A decent enough start, given the circumstances – it will have come as a huge relief to a lot of people who might have been expecting him to declare war.Gradually Johnson’s brain began to engage with itself. If not always with reality. He had been out of the country when the US had launched its drone strike on Qassem Suleimani, he said. On holiday, Walker reminded him. Yes, and Trump had sent him a Whatsapp message telling him to watch repeats of the attack on Fox News, but he hadn’t picked it up till much later as the wifi at the private bar on the beach was a bit iffy.And no, he hadn’t for a minute thought of showing some leadership and coming home. How many more times in his life was he going to be offered a £20K-a-week villa on Mustique for absolutely nothing?Sensing the interview was taking a turn for the worse, Boris reverted to his default position under pressure of making up policy as he went along. What really needed to happen next was for the US to come up with its own nuclear deal and then Iran, the UK and the other signatories could just tear up up the old Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The same JCPOA that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had spent 45 minutes defending in the Commons the previous day.Walker kindly changed the subject before Boris could do any more damage.“You’ve never dodged tricky issues in the past,” Walker now observed. Even Boris appeared shocked by this. He had spent a whole lifetime dodging the difficult questions. Especially when they are being asked by Andrew Neil or the Today programme. Or his close family.But this time it turned out that the tricky question concerned Harry and Meghan’s future. Boris visibly relaxed. He clearly doesn’t care one way or the other and is merely relieved that the royals are giving him a bit of respite from the media spotlight. I’m sure they will work something out, he mumbled.Walker then moved on to Brexit. “Your favourite subject,” he added. Now a rare moment of honesty escaped the prime minister’s lips. “Actually, it’s my least favourite subject,” he replied. Because every mention of it is a reminder of just how many lies he has told and of the reckoning he fears is to come.But just as quickly, he retreated for cover – his tragedy is that he both longs to be seen yet knows he cannot survive the exposure – and went into full pifflepafflewifflewaffle. He was epically confident of getting a full trade deal. Very, very, very, confident. As in not confident at all. He was winging it again. With Johnson the probability of something happening is in inverse proportion to the hyperbole.“Bung a bob for Big Ben bongs,” Boris bumbled. Alliteration cuts both ways. It would cost £500K to ring Big Ben on 31 January, but if there were enough people out there who were willing to stump up for the pleasure then he wouldn’t rule it out. After all, he had wasted £40m on a garden bridge that was never going to be built so he was no one to tell people how to spend their dosh. Besides, it was as close to a Brexit idend as anyone was likely to get.Boris did his best to talk over and distract Walker throughout the rest of the interview by talking nonsense – anything to run the clock down. But there was no disguising the fact we were watching a prime minister close to free fall in his free association. There’s a reason therapists often like to see their patients early in the morning. It’s because then they are less well defended and shrinks get to see the real person. The timing of the interview was turning out to be the biggest masterstroke of all.“In the past few days we’ve done a couple more things that we’ve done,” was the closest to coherence Boris could manage. When asked what he planned to do in the next year for former Labour voters from the Midlands and the north he couldn’t really come up with anything but repeat previously discredited lies about building 40 new hospitals this year, next year, sometime, never.He even forgot that he was already supposed to have a plan for social care provision in place and instead announced a proposal to come up with a plan at some point in the future. His only real commitment was to end the county (drugs) lines. Though he clearly hadn’t a clue how. It was like watching a panicky child think out loud.By now Walker was looking increasingly disturbed. He wrapped things up with a gentle lob about veganuary. This was the breaking of Boris. The floodgates opened. He needed to lose weight, he sobbed. But he couldn’t do without cheese. Life without cheese was a crime against humanity. Nor did he have the concentration to go vegan. Or the self-discipline. After all, it wasn’t as if these were qualities a country might reasonably expect of its prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc2d2d289106b523e09ababb6b62d38e822d2417/534_419_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=727ecf09c382712aed023c7d3fddb557","title":"being wealthy adds nine years to life expectancy says study","story":"ONS study finds wealth disparity in UK and US leading to growing health inequalityBeing wealthy adds nine years to healthy life expectancy: a life free from disability and pain, according to transatlantic research.The 10-year study, conducted across the UK and US, looked at all the social and economic factors behind the reasons why people sink into ill-health as they age.“We found that socio-economic inequalities in disability-free life expectancy were similar across all ages in England and the US but the biggest socio-economic advantage in both countries and across all age groups was wealth,” said Dr Paola Zaninotto, a professor in epidemiology and healthcare at University College London, which led the research.Published on Tuesday in the Journal of Gerontology, the data from 10,754 UK adults aged 50 and older, and 14,803 US adults over 50, examined how long people can expect to live free from disabilities and to what extent socio-economic factors play a part.The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and the US Health and Retirement Study both found that while life expectancy is a useful indicator of health, the quality of life as we age is crucial to determining our health.“By measuring healthy life expectancy we can get an estimate of the number of years of life spent in favourable states of health or without disability,” said Zaninotto.“We know that improving both the quality and the quantity of years that iniduals are expected to live has implications for public expenditure on health, income, long-term care of older people and work participation and our results suggest that policy makers in both England and the US must make greater efforts into reducing health inequalities,” she added.In both countries people in the study were ided into groups based on total household wealth. Comparisons were made between the richest and least wealthy groups.The paper shows that at 50 the wealthiest men in England and the US lived about an additional 31 healthy years, compared with about 22 to 23 years for those in the poorest wealth groups. Women from the wealthiest groups from the US and England lived around an additional 33 “healthy” years, compared with 24.6 and 24 years from the poorest wealth groups in England the US respectively.Recent ONS statistics also showed that those aged 65 are seeing their healthy life expectancy increase: since 2009, men in England and Wales aged 65 have gained 31.5 weeks of life and 33.5 weeks of healthy life. Women of the same age have gained 17.4 weeks of life and 23.3 weeks of healthy life over the same period.But the data also revealed that children born today are likely to spend a larger proportion of their lives in poor health than their grandparents.They will also benefit from substantially smaller increases in their life expectancy than those born a few years earlier, in the first decade of the 21st century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a13109806368fec02a815f33f19a3db3f7d3401/0_28_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d745faa768037da818f66bf8838b201","title":"researchers facing shocking levels of stress survey reveals","story":"Nearly two thirds of those who took part had witnessed bullying or harassmentOverwhelming work pressure, discrimination, and widespread bullying and harassment are contributing to “shocking” levels of stress and mental health problems among scientists, according to a major survey into research culture.Nearly two thirds of scientists who took part had witnessed bullying or harassment, with many believing it had become “culturally systemic” in science. Among those who identified as disabled, the problem was even worse, with nearly three quarters having witnessed such behaviour.The survey, commissioned by the Wellcome Trust, the biomedical research funder, shines a spotlight on a research environment that has been in trouble for some time. The system imposes a hierarchy in which superiors can seem to do no wrong, and subordinates can feel powerless to complain. It is a problem the Wellcome Trust faced itself in 2018, when it investigated leaders of its Sanger Institute in Cambridge after staff alleged bullying, mistreatment and discrimination.Beyond bad behaviour and poor management, the pressure to secure grants and churn out publications has intensified for scientists, and with it, the temptation to cut corners. The result can be wasted research funds as faulty experiments lead to retracted papers and, at worst, outright fraud and fabrication.“Some of these results are frankly shocking,” said Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. “There have been enormous scientific advances in the past 40 years and I think we’ve been seduced by that. We’ve been willing to sacrifice everything to achieve them, without asking at what cost.”Beth Thompson, research culture lead at Wellcome, said: “No one set out to create a bad system that damages people’s mental health, but we have unintentionally created a system that values the excellence of research outputs without paying enough attention to how that research is done.”Scientists who spoke to the  echoed the survey’s findings. Katerina Kademoglou, who left Britain because of Brexit and is now a postdoc at Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, said that being a scientist had taken a toll on her mental and physical health, her personal life, and her social skills. “In order to thrive, we need inclusiveness, the feeling of belonging, an engaging working environment and support,” she said.Based on her experience at previous institutions, Dr Deepti Gurdasani, now a researcher at Queen Mary, University of London, said: “A change in culture needs to occur at multiple levels. Some funders have perpetuated this culture by funding and supporting known bullies. Good management and mentoring are not valued and contribute little to career progression but stepping on others to move ahead ends up being rewarded.”Dr Tom Swift, a polymer chemist at the University of Bradford, considers himself lucky, but said the sector needs to look at workloads. Sessions on “health culture” had a tendency to descend into group counselling, with the message being that “we are all in this together”, he said.“Many colleagues feel that without the drive or ability to force institutional change, they have no option but to wait for an inevitable collapse of the system and try to pick up the pieces afterwards,” he added.Dr Sophie Acton, a researcher at UCL and co-author of a 2019 report on research culture, said PhD students and new investigators were expected to perform on ever-shorter timescales, driving up pressure and impacting the science that could be done. “More flexible funding for longer time periods or renewable time periods would help,” she said, as would more communication between funders and more junior scientists.Dr Karen Stroobants, co-founder of MetisTalk, an organisation that seeks to improve research culture, said: “To achieve the full potential of research, we will need well-rested researchers from erse backgrounds, a focus on collaboration over competition, and incentive structures that promote integrity and open research practices.”The Wellcome Trust now plans to hold a series of “town hall” meetings at UK universities to discuss the problems with scientists and explore solutions to raise in March at the Reimagine Research Summit. The Trust recently announced funding for a series of PhDs that were awarded on the strength of the recipient institution’s work culture as well as the intended research.“There’s no magic bullet that will solve all of these problems,” Farrar said. “But that’s not the same as saying there aren’t a small number of things which would make a dramatic difference to people’s lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2d46493b39086bac95407d61f683c8f31b367c/0_153_4204_2522/master/4204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c1757de6a5c5b75406f66e7bb283612","title":"aaron rodgers green bay packers nfl playoffs football","story":"For years Green Bay depended on their quarterback hauling them to victory but head coach Matt LeFleur has changed thatThe Green Bay Packers no longer need Aaron Rodgers to be Aaron Rodgers, and that has made them more dangerous than at any point since their last Super Bowl run in 2010.The arrival of head coach Matt LeFleur has reconfigured the entire offense and the organization with it. Things still run through Rodgers, because he’s Rodgers. But the system is less reliant on his inidual brilliance.The late-period Mike McCarthy-Rodgers era Packers were running on fumes. Too often they were reliant on the quarterback to be perfect on each and every down, and on receivers to consistently create separation one-on-one. Every year seemed to follow the same pattern: Green Bay roasted opponents in the regular season then disappointed in the playoffs. Rodgers could not overcome the mediocrity surrounding him or the crippling demands placed upon his shoulders.Now the Packers are more balanced. Rodgers no longer has to sprinkle pixie dust just to move the ball 30 yards downfield. The run game outperforms the passing game these days. Aaron Jones, a one-time afterthought, has morphed into a genuine star at running back. Green Bay’s offensive line, an ever-present at the top of “best-of” lists, continues to maul defensive fronts, fueling a ground attack that finished the regular season fourth in rush offense DVOA.The system is different, too. Some of Rodgers’ old standbys are still there, but LeFleur has modernized and updated everything else. There are motions and shifts and run-pass options and all the things that are now the norm across the league. Most importantly, LeFleur has balanced an uptick in run carries with a erse play-action game.One of the biggest criticisms of McCarthy was his lack of a play-action attack. Play-action, which relies on deceiving the opposing defense, is the most efficient way to move the ball, no matter the down-or-distance or game situation. And it’s the most reliable way to pop explosive plays. Now shut your eyes and picture a great Rodgers play from the last five years or so. There it is, crystal clear: Rodgers tapdancing in the backfield, avoiding the rush and launching an inch-perfect throw downfield to a receiver who has a defender draped all over him. There was little help from the coaches’ playbooks. All his biggest plays felt hard.Still, coming into the playoffs, Green Bay’s passing game looked out of sync. The battle between the rhythm and precision of LeFleur’s West Coast timing system and Rodgers’ off-beat stylings was just as strong as in the final McCarthy years. Moments of Rodgers-to-Davante Adams brilliance were intercut with the traditional sulking and headshaking that has been ever-present on the Lambeau sidelines since 2015.It all finally came together against the Seahawks last weekend. The best parts of LeFleur and Rodgers worked in concert, not conflict. LeFleur has earned a reputation during his young career for being one of the best “sequencers” in the NFL. Meaning he calls plays early in a game to set-up “pay-off” plays later on. Play-calling doesn’t get any better than this:LeFleur used the defense’s bias towards Rodgers (and the throws he likes to make) to fake them out and score a touchdown. The Packers bluffed a slant-flat concept, one of the staples of the McCartney-era teams, and a throw Rodgers has made hundreds of times in crucial spots. In a slant-flat, an outside receiver runs inside, while an inside receiver runs to the outside, hopefully confusing defenders. Seattle took the bait at the snap. He’s running his old favorite again! But it was a bluff. Adams pulled off his route and sprung towards the back of the end zone. Easy throw, easy score.Rodgers is now consistently throwing to receivers who are wide-open through play design. And he has the added bonus of throwing to Adams, who has blossomed into one of the best receivers in the league.When all of that is added together, it means Rodgers no longer has to carry the team to the promised land alone. If anything, it was Jones and the pass-rush that deserved the lion’s share of the credit for the team’s 13-3 regular-season record. Rodgers (kind of) delighted in the team winning ugly.Now he is asked to make just three or four magical plays a game the plays that make the difference between winning or losing a playoff game. When they were needed on Sunday, he delivered. By asking him to do a little less, the Packers have unlocked a lot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41bf3adcdb8c7c275abedf7f9596be5196e92b58/77_146_4368_2620/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bda0f9d47119532dc2d9a07857d4523","title":"ollie pope england batting giants south africa","story":"It pays to keep an eye on England batsmen who make their debut at the age of 22 or younger. The chances are they will become very substantial players. True class becomes apparent at an early age and selectors of just about every era have recognised that.England have two batsmen in this category who are about to play in the Test in Port Elizabeth: Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope. Their presence in the side at such a tender age does not guarantee them long and fruitful careers but the evidence suggests they have a better chance than most of success as Test batsmen.The list of batsmen making their debut at a young age contains most of England’s greats. In the 1930s Denis Compton graduated to the Test team aged just 19, while Len Hutton first appeared as a 21-year-old other debutants aged 21 were Peter May and Colin Cowdrey in the 50s and David Gower and Graham Gooch in the 70s (though the latter had a hiatus of three years after two disappointing Tests in 1975). Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain were both 21 when they first played just over a decade later. In the first decade of this century Ian Bell was 22 at the start of his Test career in the second Joe Root was 21.Of course there are disappointments as well though inevitably they are not so easy to remember. John Dewes was picked as a 21-year-old in 1948 but played only five Tests for very different reasons it never worked out for Matthew Maynard (22 upon selection) or Mark Lathwell (21) and even though he played in 52 Tests the international career of Mark Ramprakash, another 21-year-old debutant, was ultimately disappointing. Meanwhile England’s youngest Test cricketer, Brian Close, managed only 22 caps in a career ning 27 years. We still wonder what will become of Haseeb Hameed, now of Nottinghamshire, who first played for England as a 19‑year‑old.Of the current duo Pope has made the steadier start than Crawley. He does not look daunted by the occasion, as Lathwell seemed to be – and he looks calmer than Maynard, who was one of the most devastating county batsmen of his era.He looks compact, yet forceful at the crease. Just about everyone has highlighted a resemblance with Ian Bell, which is based on more than hair colour. However, Pope explains that this resemblance is not intentional.“When I went on the North v South series it was Andrew Strauss who said: ‘Who’s your favourite player growing up?’, and he expected me to say Belly. I think he’s an amazing player and I used to love watching him bat but it’s not been anything that I’ve tried to emulate. It’s a big compliment because he is a pretty class player to watch.”In fact he says his childhood heroes tended to be wicketkeeperbatsmen such as Adam Gilchrist – before remembering to mention his boss at Surrey, Alec Stewart, who is actually too old for the boyhood-hero slot.If Pope has a career even remotely resembling those of Bell, Stewart or Gilchrist, everyone will be extremely satisfied. Having been given a cap at such a young age hints that this is a distinct possibility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d16bb6472147727d0698cf6b33ac678fbbb594b3/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18a79638dd83f3ef3e73fba7ba749b54","title":"this is our family review ordinary lives make for extraordinary tv","story":"Documented over three years, Tony and Emma’s story takes in everything from the death of a child to family feuds. It’s just one tale in this exceptional Boyhood-style time capsule seriesThe idea, I gather, was inspired by the film Boyhood: to make a factual strand that compressed the passing of years to produce a slice of life that wasn’t sliced too thinly. This Is Our Family (Sky Atlantic) gave film-makers three years to follow their subjects, and develop the kind of relationships necessary to document something personal and in-depth.The first of four films, made by Clare Richards, focuses on the Borg family of Newport, Wales, specifically Tony and Emma, who are not married but have just got engaged. They seem very happy together, but, before they met, Tony, a boxing coach, was defined by his reputation as a “ladies’ man”, which is one way of saying he has eight children by an unspecified number of mums. Was Emma fully apprised of his past when they met? “Hundred per cent,” she says.Tony, a gentle but deeply undemonstrative man, is facing up to the fact that some of his children are refusing to attend the wedding, for reasons he can’t, or won’t, fully explain. “The five that aren’t coming are from the same mum,” he says. “It’s quite possible they’ve decided that me getting married to someone other than their mum, perhaps they’re not happy with that.” Maybe a fuller explanation is unnecessary. It seems his children find his newly settled status just as upsetting as his wayward past. “They don’t like this changed man,” says his non-estranged daughter Sherridan.Emma, who has children of her own, can’t make up her mind about bridesmaids. “I’m either gonna have none or I’ll be having six,” she says, laughing, then blinking back tears. At this point, it becomes clear that the focus of the film isn’t Tony, but Emma, and the subject isn’t marriage at all. It is bereavement.Eighteen months before the cameras joined the Borgs in 2016, Emma’s 19-year-old daughter, Xana, was killed in a car crash on her way home from a party. Emma had driven past the scene of the accident on her way to work that morning, not knowing that Xana was involved. Her grief is still so raw that Emma doesn’t think she can bear to have bridesmaids without Xana being among them.Three and a half years later, she still can’t bring herself to commission a headstone for Xana’s grave, or experience any kind of joy without also feeling profound sadness. The driver of the car and another passenger were jailed for their part in Xana’s death, and Emma wonders how she will cope when they are let out (both men have since been released).In light of all this, Tony’s estrangement from his own children seems more difficult for Emma than it is for him. “They’re his kids,” she says. “And I know what it’s like to lose kids. If I could sacrifice my relationship to have my daughter back, I would.”Post-wedding comes the revelation that Tony is the father of a ninth child, Shannon, welcomed into the extended family retroactively after a DNA test. When the result comes back, Tony says to her, simply: “Congratulations.” He seems stressed, but pleased, although it is hard to tell with Tony: behind his still expression, his eyes are always darting about warily. “I’m a pretty cold person,” he says. “That’s the way it is.”From the outset, it is clear that a film this painful, honest and sensitive could not have been made without the time it took to establish an extraordinary level of trust between the film-maker and her subjects. It seems a bit odd that Sky, having taken such pains to lay the groundwork for the series, had no correspondingly generous assessment of its audience’s attention : shorn of ad breaks, the whole thing is fewer than 50 minutes long. Partly, of course, the compression is the point – the viewer experiences it as a form of time travel. But three years in under an hour is a brisk trot, one that necessarily leads to some blurring.What you are left with is a closely observed study of two people coping with grief and estrangement with courage, patience and humour. Above all, the film exposes the extraordinarily complex emotional lives of people, who from a distance may seem to be the sort who just get on with things. It reminds you that everyone just gets on with things, and no one does."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb7ffd6d9dfbda0460c36a12a56818f6adc7c510/192_400_4046_2428/master/4046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2506c0d43b97c6e0a41b6902e35e6709","title":"tv tonight david tennant michael sheen neil gaiman terry pratchett good omens","story":"The end is nigh in this adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s Good Omens.

It didn’t force any evacuations.All the fuel evaporated very quickly and nothing flammable remained in the air or on the ground, he said.People were treated with soap and water, the fire inspector Henry Narvaez said.Shortly after takeoff, Delta Air Lines flight 89 to Shanghai “experienced an engine issue requiring the aircraft to return quickly to LAX. The aircraft landed safely after release of fuel, which was required as part of normal procedure to reach a safe landing weight,” the company said in a statement. The airline did not release details about the engine problem.The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating.“There are special fuel-dumping procedures for aircraft operating into and out of any major US airport,” the FAA said in a statement. “These procedures call for fuel to be dumped over designated unpopulated areas, typically at higher altitudes so the fuel atomizes and disperses before it reaches the ground.”The FlightAware website’s flight track showed the jet took off over the ocean and made an immediate right turn toward land and circled back over Southern California to approach the airport from the east.Delta said it was in touch with the airport and fire department and shared concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children.The Los Angeles unified school district said its Park Avenue Elementary campus in Cudahy and 93rd Street Elementary had direct impacts from the fuel.Cornell said 31 children and adults were affected at Park Avenue, and 12 at 93rd Street. The rest of those affected were at other schools.The school district said in a statement that paramedics were immediately called to treat anyone complaining of skin irritation or breathing problems and that its environmental health and safety office also responded.Diego Martinez, a Park Avenue sixth-grader, said he and his classmates were outside for physical education class when they saw the airplane flying low overhead.“It was very close,” he said. Shortly afterwards the air filled with the pungent odor of fuel. “It was very strong, the odor,” the 12-year-old said.Diego was not doused but some of his friends complained that their skin was itching.Some teachers at Park Avenue had headaches from the smell, said Antonio Buenabad, area representative for the United Teachers Los Angeles union.They were anxious to get home and shower because the stench was very strong, he said of the teachers.A high school was also affected, but no one was treated there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e44b1afb686bc6019786618c4f18cfc08833d2/0_227_6880_4129/master/6880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57b66730fcdba8975e3503f6fe2670ee","title":"janelle monae non binary pronouns they them","story":"Janelle Monáe just came out as non-binary, joining a growing number of people who use ‘theythem’ as pronouns. You might be wondering how to address themMonáe’s tweet came after the recent announcement of Sam Smith, who recently said they felt “just as much a woman as I am man”. Both celebrities joined the increasing number of young people who identify neither as male or female.Non-binary people tend to prefer using theythem pronouns (although not exclusively – some use she and he interchangeably). If gender neutral pronouns intimidate you, you’re not the only one. As someone who is new to using them (a number of my friends have recently started to identify as non-binary), I confess it can be intimidating when you want to respect someone’s wishes without making any blunders.Putting someone’s dignity before my shyness about how to use a pronoun is, of course, the bare minimum. But I admit to having made mistakes – even avoiding using pronouns in the past, for fear of getting it wrong.It really isn’t that hard, however, to get it right. Reasons for choosing gender neutral pronouns are complex and personal. Some people do it because they don’t feel they fit into a gender. For others, it’s a form of protest: they contest rigid gender expectations and would rather live without them. Being gender non-conforming, right down to their pronouns, is how they choose to identify.So please, if you learn someone uses theythem pronouns, don’t respond: “We get it OK – she’s gay!” – as my friend’s parents recently did.It is normal in the English language to use theythem pronouns when we don’t know the gender of the person to which we’re referring, or if we want our sentence to be applicable to all genders.This isn’t new – the saying “Everybody loves their own mother” has been used since around late 1300. Both Jane Austen and Geoffrey Chaucer – who died in 1400 - used pronouns that way.While it is no longer grammatically incorrect to use theythem as singular anymore, people still get confused about it. A friend’s parent recently responded to their pronouns, saying: “But if I tell Shelly you’re coming round for dinner, she’ll think you’re bringing extra people!”Try this: if you are using the pronoun in a scenario where there is no confusion over singular versus plural, just go ahead and use it (“You are going to meet my friend Poppy today, I hope you like them”).If you are using it in an instance where it might be misconstrued as plural, you can change the first part of the sentence to make it clear (“I may bring a friend, their name is Poppy”).If you still feel that is confusing, you can be explicit (“I asked Poppy – who uses theythem pronouns – they might come”). This also takes the onus off your non-binary friend for having to explain it themselves later.Avoid assuming every person’s gender. Feel free to ask people when you meet them what pronouns they use. Feel free to put your own pronouns in your email signature, or to introduce people using your pronouns (this can take the focus off non-binary people having to do all the work).Embrace doing your own research on pronouns, without expecting non-binary people to educate you. Encourage open dialogue, which means being open about your own shortcomings or fears, when relevant. Ensure this is a means to steer conversation forward (“Hey, did I get that right just then?”) not back (“Well actually this is pretty scary for me, so you shouldn’t correct me”).People may use your respect for another’s pronouns as a means to argue with you about the broader political context around gender andor LGBTQ rights. But you don’t need to be needlessly drawn into an argument unless that’s where you want to go. Briefly explain why you are doing it, and if the challenge escalates, consider shutting down the conflict (“It’s my choice to respect their wishes” or even the more direct “I don’t want to argue about this”).When you make a mistake, apologize, be gracious, and move on. Generally people aren’t out to get you. Don’t get too hung up: my experience is that people know getting it wrong is part of the process and are forgiving if they feel you are trying your best.Sometimes you can check that you said the right thing first, rather than getting caught up in your head (“Hey, when I said that, was it offensive?’). Above all, recognize mistakes happen and apologies are OK, but don’t mistake them for real work. Saying sorry a handful of times might be fine, but if you’re misgendering someone over and over again you might want to think about why, and do better.Exposure is key. Keep using theythem, and soon it will feel normal. That’s the aim."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17984de66cfe52c5ddd3ac568f2bfea744c15555/130_0_2944_1767/master/2944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8f7429d2f69f6b2a044bba03995414e","title":"australian journalist scott mcintyre gets suspended sentence over search for his children japan","story":"Japanese court convicted Scott McIntyre of trespassing in attempt to find childrenScott McIntyre, a former sports reporter for Australia’s SBS network, has been given a suspended prison sentence in Tokyo after being found guilty of trespassing during an attempt to locate his children, whom he has not seen for eight months.The Australian freelance journalist, who is based in the Japanese capital, was arrested in late November, a month after allegedly gaining unauthorised access to the common area of the apartment building where his parents-in-law live.The Tokyo district court on Wednesday sentenced him to six months in prison, suspended for three years.McIntyre, 45, was initially held at a police station in Tokyo before being transferred to the city’s main detention centre in Kosuge, which last year was home to the former Nissan boss and international fugitive Carlos Ghosn.McIntyre said he had shared a tiny cell, which was lit day and night, with a convicted murderer who was appealing against his sentence. Conditions there had almost driven him “insane”, he told the  during an interview at the detention centre earlier this month.McIntyre, who was led into his court hearing last week in handcuffs and with a rope tied around his waist, apologised for his actions, claiming he had only wanted to ensure that his son and daughter, aged eight and 11, were safe after large parts of Japan were pummelled by Typhoon Hagibis in mid-October last year.His parents, who flew to Japan from their home near Sydney to attend their son’s trial, said they were relieved that he had finally been freed.“We’re glad that it’s over,” McIntyre’s mother, Lynne, said. “But we don’t have our missing grandchildren back, and now we may never get them back.”McIntyre claimed in court that his wife – with whom he has started orce proceedings – had abducted their children in May last year and severed all contact with him.  has contacted McIntyre’s wife for comment.McIntyre is one of a number of foreign parents who say they have been denied access to their children after separating from or orcing their Japanese spouses.The Hague convention on international child abductions, which Japan ratified in 2013 after years of pressure, requires parents accused of abducting their children to return them to their country of habitual residence.But the treaty does not apply to cases involving couples living in Japan, even if one of the parents is a foreign national, and Japanese courts almost always award custody to the mother.“All I and other parents want is for Japan to join the civilised world and institute a system of joint custody,” McIntyre said outside the court after the ruling. “I am here on behalf of all those abducted children who don’t have a voice. This is not a way for a modern society to operate. Children deserve two parents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d45ef9ae73fbe649666152eac815947e70e3c52/0_128_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48c9ea3fb2c2904d5e58ccaa4dbd4667","title":"dream of a banlieue kid france hails les miserabless oscar nod","story":"Ladj Ly’s Les Misérables about police violence is nominated for best foreign language featureThe nomination of the Paris banlieue movie Les Misérables for best foreign language feature at the Oscars has been hailed as a historic moment – the first time a black film director has represented France at the Academy Awards, and for a low-budget drama about the topical issue of police violence.The film – which won universal critical acclaim and box-office success in France – is the first full-length feature by Ladj Ly, who grew up and still lives in Montfermeil in Seine-Saint-Denis at the heart of the high-rise estates that saw the worst of the urban rioting in 2005 after the death of two young boys hiding from police.Ly said he hoped the film’s Oscar nomination would inspire young people in France to follow their dreams. “If I win the Oscar, I’ll use that platform,” he told Agence France-Presse. “My film is politically engaged and ultimately concerns all countries.”Les Misérables is based on a real-life event in 2008 when Ly, who had taken to documenting his neighbourhood with a camera, recorded footage of police violence. The film, which is in turns funny and tragic, tells the story of a police officer who joins a patrol on high-rise estates, where a young teenager is violently arrested. Police are regularly accused of using excessive force in poorer neighbourhoods, particularly against black and minority ethnic young men. High-profile cases continue include that of Adama Traoré, a young man who died in police custody in 2016 after being subject to restraint, and a another called Theo who sustained serious injuries after being stopped by police in one of the Parisian banlieues in 2017, which led to nights of clashes between young people and police.The film’s nomination comes amid a growing clamour over police violence in France – from the injuries at anti-government gilets jaunes demonstrations to deaths after arrests. The president himself, Emmanuel Macron, on Tuesday called for new measures to improve police ethics and controls.Ly deliberately set out not to make a film that simply portrayed banlieue versus police, but which explored the difficulties and contradictions of low-paid officers themselves.Les Misérables was shot over six weeks in part on housing estates in Montfermeil, a place which had historically inspired the atmosphere of simmering revolution in Victor Hugo’s epic novel of the 1830s.The movie, which is released in the UK in March, won the jury prize at last year’s Cannes film festival. Macron himself was reportedly “moved” by how true to life it was. Ly has called it a film about French patriotism – it opens with kids from housing estates celebrating France’s World Cup win on Paris’s Champs Elysées before returning to their everyday hardship. The writer Éric Vuillard called it a “universal film about segregated society”.Toufik Ayadi, one of the film’s producers, said: “Everyone will read a different type of importance into the film being nominated for an Oscar – it’s important as a film, but also politically. And it’s important for Ladj Ly’s background – this is a first-time feature film made by someone from the banlieue when it’s very complicated to make films if you’re not in the network. It was a hard film to finance, it faced a stack of constraints but managed to get made.“For us, the biggest thing about this nomination is it means we can still believe in dreams: the dream of a kid from the banlieue who made it to the Oscars is a little bit of magic in our current society. And there’s also the fact that France has not won for a long time in the foreign language category. The fact that it’s the first time a black director has represented France at the Oscars proves things can change.”Christophe Barral, another producer, said: “The film goes beyond just police violence, it explores misery. And we have recently seen a lot of people’s anger over misery – a misery which is the worst enemy of society.”Ly, 39 – who is self-taught, and set up a local banlieue collective for short films – has previously made documentaries and short films in his neighbourhood. He said when the film came out that for decades there had been a taboo around police violence on housing estates.He said he hoped the film would “make young people think, would give them a desire to pursue their dreams and know that you can start from nothing, from as low-down as it gets, and find yourself at the Oscars”.The producers said the film had sold widely internationally and had a universal appeal. “There are abandoned neighbourhoods in the US, Brazil or UK – they are everywhere, the people change but the misery stays the same,” Barral said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8512ed0f3944405348f7291cd31f2806aaf8bff/438_552_4210_2525/master/4210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eab55bfe2e0adb9295d956666359e48","title":"exclusive 2000 syrian troops deployed to libya to support regime","story":"Anti-Turkish sentiment could grow after Ankara agrees to help fight against insurgencyTwo thousand Syrian fighters have travelled from Turkey or will arrive imminently to fight on the battlefields of Libya, Syrian sources in all three countries have said, in an unprecedented development that threatens to further complicate the north African state’s intractable civil war.The deployment came after Turkey agreed last month to come to the aid of the Libyan prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, who is backed by the UN, in the face of a months-long campaign by his rival, the warlord Khalifa Haftar.Ankara has supported the Syrian opposition since the early days of the battle against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, even as the original Free Syrian Army umbrella group grew weak and splintered because of infighting and the growth of Islamist elements within rebel ranks. Turkey now uses some rebel fighters as proxies against Kurdish-led forces despite allegations of human rights abuses from watchdogs.“This is a very different situation to Syria,” said Claudia Gazzini, a senior Libya analyst with the International Crisis Group. “Anti-Turkish sentiment is already strong because of Ankara’s intervention and could grow as a result of this, playing in Haftar’s favour.”An initial deployment of 300 men from the second ision of the Syrian National Army (SNA), an umbrella of Syrian rebel groups funded by Turkey, left Syria through the Hawar Kilis military border crossing on 24 December, followed by 350 more on 29 December.They were then flown to Tripoli, the Libyan capital, where they have been posted to frontline positions in the east of the city.Another 1,350 men crossed into Turkey on 5 January. Some have since been deployed to Libya with others still undergoing training at camps in southern Turkey. More men from the Islamist Sham Legion are also considering travelling to Libya.The figures are significantly higher than most previous estimates.Once source said the Syrian men are expected to coalesce into a ision named after Libyan resistance leader Omar al-Mukhtar, who was executed by Italy in 1931 and became popular in Syria during the 2011 Arab spring.The fighters have signed six-month contracts directly with the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), rather than with the Turkish military, SNA sources said, for $2,000 (£1,500) a month – a vast sum compared with the 450-550 Turkish lira (£52-£72) a month they earn in Syria. All have been promised Turkish nationality, a carrot Ankara has used to cajole fighters in brigades on its payroll for several years.Turkey is also paying medical bills for injured soldiers and is responsible for repatriating the dead to Syria. At least four Syrians have died in Libya already, the  can confirm, although their units said they died while stationed on front lines against Kurdish-led forces in north-east Syria.Last month phone footage of men with Syrian accents claiming to be in Tripoli surfaced on social media, in which one man said: “The Free Syrian Army is in Libya to defend Islam.”“We liberated this entire military camp from Haftar’s forces,” said another, before turning to a colleague to ask: “What is his name? Haftar? Hantar?”The footage was questioned by many who wondered how and why Syrian men – nominally still fighting in the nine-year-old war against Assad – had ended up so far from home.Both Ankara and Tripoli have repeatedly denied the presence of Syrian fighters in Libya, as has the SNA.  understands that Syrian fighters in the country have since been banned from posting any evidence of their whereabouts to social media.Turkey itself has so far sent just 35 soldiers to Tripoli in an advisory capacity, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said last week. Unlike last October’s incursion into Kurdish-held parts of Syria, intervention in Libya has little support among the Turkish public.Speaking on Tuesday, however, after Haftar walked away from talks in Moscow without agreeing to a ceasefire, Erdoğan said Turkey would not refrain from “teaching a lesson he deserves” to the Libyan warlord.Haftar is supported by Egypt, France, Jordan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, while Sarraj is backed by Italy, Qatar and Turkey. Officials from Sarraj’s internationally recognised government have expressed anger that their allies, other than Turkey, have effectively abandoned them since Haftar declared his intention to capture Tripoli last April.The GNA was reportedly initially reluctant to accept Syrian fighters instead of Turkish troops but accepted the idea when Haftar’s forces drew closer to the capital.Last month, the  reported that an influx of 3,000 Sudanese had been sent to Benghazi to fight for Haftar, joining around 600 Russian mercenaries, in another sign the conflict’s parameters are growing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7837417a4c26c31fdb356aa4f9d34e579ae9555/0_129_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=315f6287758ceea63ab35b7980ff0421","title":"holocaust museum to open in amsterdam after 4m german gift","story":"Germany answers plea for funding in memory of 140,000 Dutch Jews murdered by NazisA Holocaust museum is to be built in Amsterdam after Germany offered a €4m donation in memory of the 140,000 Dutch Jews murdered by the Nazis, amounting to three-quarters of the community, the highest death rate in Europe.A temporary exhibition, held in a former religious seminary used during the war to smuggle hundreds of Jewish children to safety, will be closed in February to allow for two years of construction.A second building on the other side of the Plantage Middenlaan, where Jews were rounded up for deportation, will also be developed to allow the new institution to offer educational programmes as well as the permanent exhibition.Emile Schrijver, the director of Amsterdam’s Jewish Cultural Quarter, told the Het Parool newspaper: “The decision is made. We dare say this with this contribution: the National Holocaust Museum is coming.”The museum’s management had requested a donation from the German government but were surprised by the result. “We thought there might be of a donation of half a million to €1m. A few weeks ago we received a message from Germany informing us that we would get €4m,” Schrijver said.“Germany feels responsible for the history. The country has long been engaged in the conscientious processing of the past. With this contribution they take their responsibility and want to warn people. We are naturally delighted with this large amount, but the symbolism behind it is even more important than the money itself.”A civil occupying regime led by the Austrian Nazi and lawyer Arthur Seyss-Inquart was imposed on the Netherlands after the German invasion in May 1940. It ruthlessly enforced Germany’s antisemitic laws with the help of collaborators, paying the Dutch state railway for deportations to Europe’s concentration camps.This month is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, where more than 1 million people died.Heiko Maas, Germany’s foreign affairs minister, said the museum would mark the postwar reconciliation between the Netherlands and Germany.He said: “In the Netherlands, the Nazi destruction machine worked in the most horrible way. The shared memory of this darkest chapter in our German history makes clear the importance of the achievements of European unification and the reconciliation between Germany and the Netherlands.“The National Holocaust Museum in Amsterdam places the right emphasis by encouraging young people to become acquainted with this subject, emphasising the importance of democracy and universal human rights.“I am grateful for this contribution to the fight against antisemitism and I am pleased that we can support this important initiative with our contribution to the new Holocaust Museum.”The museum still requires a further €6m to achieve its €27m target. “We still have many applications pending, including with the municipality of Amsterdam, foreign governments, provinces, lotteries and private sponsors,” Schrijver said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58b38c4a73ca02e8e47f759df092d627d0316388/0_251_6478_3888/master/6478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81ce4a2b46b5ff4adc530d0f12485065","title":"internet partially restored kashmir social media ban stays","story":"Hospitals, banks and travel companies to get broadband after five-month shutdownInternet is to be partially restored in Kashmir after an unprecedented five-month blackout, but only for institutions providing “essential services”, while social media sites will still be banned.The decision to gradually reintroduce broadband internet to the disputed Himalayan region, after the longest shutdown ever imposed in a democracy, followed a supreme court ruling last week that the indefinite suspension was illegal and amounted to an abuse of power. The judges ordered a review to be carried out within a week.On Tuesday night, the Kashmir administration declared that institutions such as hospitals, banks, government offices, hotels and tour and travel companies would have their broadband restored, to be provided by 400 new internet kiosks. It will first be rolled out in the region’s capital, Srinagar, and gradually to other areas.However, personal broadband connections and all access to social media sites remained banned.“There shall be complete restriction on social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and virtual private network applications for the time being,” said the order issued by Shaleen Kabra, the principal secretary of the Home Department of Jammu and Kashmir. The order will remain in place for the new week, when it will be reviewed again.All mobile and broadband internet connections have been suspended in Kashmir since 5 August, when India’s BJP government, led by Narendra Modi, revoked the decades-long special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which had given the region autonomy, and split the state into two territories under the direct control of Delhi.A severe crackdown followed, during which troops moved into the region, curfews were imposed, and internet and phone services shut down. While many of the restrictions have since been eased, more than 7 million people in Kashmir have been without internet for more than 150 days, which has come at a cost of more than $1bn to the economy and destroyed lives and businesses.Mobile internet remains suspended but under the order, 2G mobile internet on post-paid mobiles will be restored in five districts in the Jammu region, to allow people access to “white-listed sites” such as internet banking.In line with the supreme court ruling, the order by the Kashmir administration also laid out its justification for the ongoing internet shutdown. The ongoing suspension, stated the order, was to stop “the sustained efforts being made by the terrorists to infiltrate from across the border, reactivate their cadres and scale up anti-national activities in Kashmir” and to prevent the circulation of fake news in the region."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed4c565c1dbf70b86a6249d57ca2c7ac195c7f47/0_1321_2906_1744/master/2906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d45daa26a0bc5f4a71c4591ff1166911","title":"tsai ing wen says china must face reality of taiwans independence","story":"China has repeatedly said that it will bring Taiwan under its authority, but president says election result shows citizens don’t agreeTaiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen has called on China to “face reality” and “review” its current policy toward the de facto nation that Beijing claims is part of its territory.Tsai, who won re-election in a landslide victory on Saturday, told reporters: “We hope China can thoroughly understand the opinion and will expressed by Taiwanese people in this election and review their current policies.”The president’s comments come days after China’s top diplomat said that unification with China was a “historical inevitability” and that anyone who opposed it would “stink for 10,000 years,” an idiom to mean someone will go down in infamy.China has repeatedly said that it will bring Taiwan under its authority by any means necessary, including force. Analysts believe Chinese leader Xi Jinping aims to achieve that by 2049, the deadline for the country to achieve its “great rejuvenation”.Taiwan was ruled for more than three decades by the nationalist army, the Kuomintang, which fled to the island in 1949 after being defeated by the Chinese communist party and created a rival government, the Republic of China, better known today as Taiwan. It has since transformed into a multi-party democracy, under a government and political system completely separate from China’s.The election of a candidate who campaigned heavily on promises to not allow Taiwan to become another Hong Kong has been widely seen as a rebuke to China’s efforts to intimidate and persuade Taiwan citizens to support unification.Under Tsai’s first term, Beijing severed a dialogue mechanism with Taiwan and has sought to isolate it diplomatically. In a show of strength, China sailed its new aircraft carrier through the Taiwan strait twice in the run up to the election.Tsai opposes unification but has never said that she would formally declare Taiwan’s independence, which would provoke Beijing.“We don’t have a need to declare ourselves an independent state,” Tsai told the BBC. “We are an independent country already and we call ourselves the Republic of China, Taiwan.”Tsai said the election served as a “very strong message from the people of Taiwan.”“They don’t like the idea of being threatened all the time. We are a successful democracy … We deserve respect from China,” she said. “We have a separate identity and we’re a country of our own.”Beijing has refused to deal directly with Tsai on the grounds that she has not, like her predecessor, accepted the so-called 1992 consensus which says that Taiwan and China are part of “one China”. The vague agreement leaves it up to each side to interpret the definition of “one China”.Tsai said that before dialogue can be re-opened, Beijing must review its current approach. “If they are not prepared to face reality, then whatever we offer won’t be satisfying to them.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/123227464c6ea16f5e251ede7be9689c2c8bb02c/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a32607f7b9d84069c31e0c7db83f281","title":"wednesday briefing wildlife toll of fast rail","story":"HS2 nature corridor plans are not enough, say Wildlife Trusts … Flybe saved for now … and knock-on effects of Fifty Shades of GreyGood morning.

Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons  The  In a letter to Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Ireland South MEP says that while he recognised the importance of the agreement passing to avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit, he was “very concerned” that the UK may seek to dilute the rights of IrishEU citizens in Northern Ireland after Brexit.“In all conscience, I cannot vote for an agreement that is so vague and leaves it open for a dilution of citizens’ rights into the future,” said Mr Kelleher in the letter sent last week.“EU citizens in Northern Ireland need clarity and confirmation that their futures are protected and that they cannot be used as future bargaining chips.”The Cork politician asked the Tánaiste to raise the issue at EU Council level with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.Mr Kelleher told The  that he had also raised his concerns in letters to the British prime minister Boris Johnson and the European Commission.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was aware of his concerns and the position he had taken on the agreement, he said. He pointed out that the European Parliament had a right to debate the issue as part of the EU’s ratification of the withdrawal agreement.“If you don’t raise these issues in advance, well then there is no point in I saying afterwards that maybe I should have done something differently,” said Mr Kelleher.The European Parliament is due to vote on the agreement on January 29th. This is the last legal hurdle before the agreement comes into effect and the UK departs the EU on January 31st.The MEP said that if his concerns about IrishEU citizens’ rights in Northern Ireland were not addressed in “an impartial, independent manner”, then he would have “grave concerns” about the withdrawal deal “without having any ability to deal with these issues at a later stage”.‘This is their home’In his letter – seen by The  – Mr Kelleher says that “of most concern” to him about the withdrawal agreement are the “hundreds of thousands of EU citizens living in Northern Ireland, the vast majority of whom are Irish citizens.“When Brexit does happen, there will be more EU citizens in Northern Ireland than there are in some member states such as Luxembourg or Malta, ” he said.“These IrishEU citizens have done nothing to deserve this. They have consistently voted remain in the referendum and general elections since 2016.“They were born here and this is their home. They supported the Good Friday Agreement on the assumption of continued EU membership.”Mr Kelleher said EU citizens from the other 26 member states who had made Northern Ireland their home and started families with other IrishEU citizens were “now in complete limbo”.The withdrawal agreement made no explicit reference to IrishEU citizens born and living in Northern Ireland, he wrote, stressing that they were not the same as French or Dutch nationals living in London and “should be treated in a different way”.He told The  that an Irish citizen living in Dublin who is married to a French national may have to apply for “settled status” from the UK if they decided to move to Belfast.“That just diminishes the free movement of people in terms of working North and South and the co-operation built up over the last 21 years since the Good Friday Agreement was passed,” he said.Brexit has renewed general concerns in Northern Ireland about the birthright status of citizens to identify as Irish or British or both under the 1998 Belfast Agreement and in turn their right to EU protections if they consider themselves IrishEU citizens.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Decision made.As his Ministers watched in silence, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar turned to sign the order requesting the dissolution of his Government. He hesitated suddenly, pen poised above the document. He looked around the table.“Anyone want me to change my mind?”And finally, after a soggy morning of giddy anticipation around Leinster House, Leo appeared at the steps of a rain-lashed Government Buildings and called time.He did it in two languages, reminding voters he always said he would go for an election when the moment is right.“Anois an t-am sin,” the Taoiseach declared portentously. “Now is that time.”At least it was, until he decided to start tinkering with the clock, confusing matters mid-speech and announcing, by way of Brexit, “in fact, it’s only half time.”Tuesday’s brief history of Day One saw Fine Gael further mangling time with the low-key unveiling of a grammatically off-key campaign slogan. First sightings of election literature revealed the limp rallying cry: “A future to look forward to.”Dominic Cummings must be seething with envy.Posters began bothering lampposts in the morning while the Cabinet was still meeting and hours before the election date was formally announced. In fact, even the Taoiseach’s posters got up early in the morning.Favourite catchphraseThat may be because someone in the party was being really clever around Leo’s favourite catchphrase about looking after the people who get up early in the morning such as office cleaners and Cork-based TDs catching flights to Brussels. But, judging by the campaign slogan, that’s highly unlikely.“A future to look forward to.” It fairly trips off the tongue. Mr Micawber would approve. The team had been keen to sign off on “Something will turn up” until a minion realised Dickens got there first.Of course, it has to be about the future, going forward. Although, in the space-time continuum, there are endless possibilities.A future to look forward to.A present to look away from.A past to make a bags of.As Kung Fu Panda once said: “Today is history, tomorrow is a mystery.” But what if their great future turns out to be behind them?This is where Brexit comes in. It is Fine Gael’s election trump card and was produced with a proud flourish by the Taoiseach in the opening minutes of what will be 3½ weeks of out-Borising Boris on the Brexit front. In an opening salvo delivered to an audience of cold and rain-sodden hacks in the courtyard of Government Buildings, Leo’s message was very simple: We will get Brexit done.His negotiating team in Europe, led by Simon Coveney and Helen McEntee, is seen to have done an excellent job in this regard on the country’s behalf over the last couple of years. Now, the push is on to allow them continue in their roles for the greater good. It’s a persuasive pitch and, by far, Fine Gael’s best line.PackagedThe Taoiseach could have made his announcement indoors, but the imposing backdrop of Government Buildings was the perfect setting for a man being packaged in this election as a European statesman with proven leadership credentials on the international stage.“We have the team. We have the track record. We have the plans,” he proclaimed at the end of his speech, rapidly turning on his heels and scuttling inside. There would be not questions from the media. It will be interesting to see if that policy continues.His party has recycled its slogan from the last general election, which is very on trend.“All Ireland for all in de turtyturd Dáil”. Or maybe just “An Ireland for all”.“It’s not a slogan,” he insisted, nipping in for a sneaky press conference in the half hour before the Taoiseach fired the starting gun. “It’s a philosophy. It’s a viewpoint.” He also called it “a philosophy, slogan”.He was joined by his finance spokesman Michael McGrath and front benchers Niamh Smith and Lisa Chambers for this early philosophical dander around “a very, very relevant political viewpoint”. We hadn’t seen Lisa since before the Christmas break and were delighted to discover she will be concerned with more than political developments in the weeks and months to come.First childShe is expecting her first child around the middle of April. “It’s going to be a busy and eventful start to the year, that’s for sure,” said Lisa afterwards.But think of poor Micheál, who has been expecting for years now. This time though, Fianna Fail is nursing very real hopes that their leader can finally make it to the Taoiseach’s office. He was certainly in high spirits on Tuesday.“The ground campaign will be very important,” he stressed. And the importance of the doors cannot be underestimated either, said the Fianna Fáil leader, who intends to carry on his proud election tradition of racing around the country like a man possessed.“I’ve been on the doors a number of years now.”While the Taoiseach will be busy pointing to the strong economy and the number of people working in the country, the Fianna Fáil leader will be busy pointing out that “things are not working in the country”.If Leo was all about Brexit and broad economic figures in his first outing, Micheál was all about housing and health in his opening performance. “Things are simply not working in this country in so many areas,” he argued. His party will be putting forward “a positive, comprehensive agenda” to change this.He had a little chuckle at Fine Gael’s slogan about looking forward to the future. “It kinda reveals the essence of this Fine Gael party. Everything is a way into the future.” People can’t wait for FG’s future, he reckoned, while touching only on the nice things about Fianna Fáil’s past.‘Cold spines’Apparently they put “the backbone” into the fiscal recovery while “there’ll be a certain sort of shiver going about the country” when people contemplate a Fine Gael future. As his predecessor Bertie Ahern once said: “It’s enough to send cold spines up and down your back”.As the circus rolled into town, Finian McGrath was preparing to pack up and move out. The popular Minister of State announced he would not be seeking re-election and the leafy groves of Dublin Bay North reverberated with the joyful cries of Labour Senator and former TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin.Senator Michael McDowell, delighted to see the Judicial Appointments Bill he fiercely opposed in the Seanad die with this Government, announced he would not be running for the Dáil. This came as a surprise to many as the former tánaiste seemed very keen to return to the Lower House.Perhaps he took some soundings on his prospects in Dublin Bay South. Finian may have done the same across the bay. And then, as the late Larry Gogan might have said, “Aah, sure the polls didn’t suit you.”The Taoiseach takes his half-time Brexit roadshow to Monaghan on Wednesday where he will be showing off Simon and Helen while burnishing his rural credentials."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Politics latest news: Health Secretary suggests A\u0026ampE waiting time target is outdated and should be replaced Japan star cabinet member announces plans to take paternity leave as \u0026#39role model\u0026#39 Iran threatens UK and European troops in Middle East\u0026#39Human beings have overrun the world,\u0026#39 says Sir David Attenborough in trailer for his new filmWednesday morning news briefing: Meghan\u0026#39s father set to testifyUK weather: Storm Brendan rips roof from Slough building as more than 200 flood warnings issuedMeghan Markle\u0026#39s father set to testify in court against her as text messages detailing their fall-out are revealed The Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayPassengers sob as flight violently buffeted by Storm Brendan - and there\u0026#39s more bad weather on the wayElizabeth Warren snubs Bernie Sanders\u0026#39 handshake as pair clash in Democratic debateFive things we learned from the last Democratic 2020 debate before voting startsGovernment issues ultimatum to British Isil recruit: \u0026#39your kids can come back but only without you\u0026#39Comment: Big Ben\u0026#39s bong would be a fitting end to three years of Remain mischiefComment: It is now only a matter of time until the downfall of Iran\u0026#39s ayatollahsBoris Johnson calls for \u0026#39Trump deal\u0026#39 with Iran as UK and allies trigger dispute mechanism over nuclear violationsDuchess of Sussex visits women\u0026#39s centre in Vancouver in first public engagement since Royal Family \u0026#39split\u0026#39Children injured in Los Angeles as plane dumps fuel onto school during emergency landingWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/07/11/istock-187287146.jpg","title":"cycle to work bike cycling london 2020 environment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Can Jessica Jones go a whole year without using anything else?In 2020 I will be pledging to become more conscious of the products I purchase and how they are sourced. Like most of us, I am guilty of buying unsustainable products: I use a lot of toiletries and cosmetic products like perfume, makeup and hair serums. I will try to choose products that are made purely from natural ingredients, and ones which have certifications to support their “natural beauty” claims. Using natural ingredients is crucial in preventing toxic chemicals found in beauty and care products, some of them carcinogenic, from seeping into our environment’s ecosystems and into our bodies.The beauty and personal care industry\u0026nbsphas had immense impacts on the environment but recently, with increased awareness of the issues, measures have been taken to combat these. For example, in June 2018, the UK government’s ban on microbeads came into effect and a ban on cotton buds is set to follow in April 2020.\u0026nbsp11 best plastic-free beauty products that aren\u0027t adding to landfillSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst this is a good start, it is not enough. Microbeads are one small part of a much larger issue: the excessive consumerism of beauty and personal care products leading to vast amounts of wastage and toxic pollution. Other damages include plastic packaging with limited recyclability, the carbon footprint of transporting cosmetic goods, harmful toxins in products that are washed down the drain into marine environments, the water wastage in manufacturing processes, and the use of palm oil.\u0026nbspI want to buy from brands that produce sustainably from the offset, in both interior content as well as their packaging. Companies like Wearth sell glass large glass bottles to dispense bulk-bought or homemade shampoo and conditioner and LUSH offer zero-impact packaging products like shampoo bars which claim\u0026nbspto reduce your carbon footprint: one lorry load of shampoo bars delivers the same amount of hair washes as fifteen lorries of liquid shampoo. I will try to ensure that any plastic or material packaging that I do buy is fully recyclable.Created with Sketch.

I have only recently started to consider what is really in the products I buy and how they affect the environment. I am not used to reading ingredient lists, let alone understanding what most of the chemicals actually are. Finding affordable alternatives (on a student budget!) that do not sacrifice sustainability or quality might prove difficult, especially as there are certain products that I use daily that I love. But homemade alternatives to products like body and lip scrubs, are a good way of saving money, whilst also using more simple and natural ingredients.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019.

This shows that bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, are increasingly seen by some investors as a hedge in times of geopolitical crises.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile, making it difficult to attribute specific events or reasons to market movements.But the volatility, combined with a lack of mainstream applications, means bitcoin is consistently referred to as digital gold because it is more commonly used\u0026nbspas a store of value than a currency.Bitcoin is digital gold, explained\u0026nbspBrooke Stoddard, an investor and former Goldman Sachs associate. Bitcoin and gold are borderless, decentralised, and verifiable. Both are worth something, they store value. But bitcoin is easier to transfer, ide, and harder to counterfeit.Bitcoin\u0027s price is therefore often compared with that of gold, though research suggests the two are not linked.Bitcoin has risen by more than 20 per cent since the start of 2020, however it fell by nearly a third between October and November last year during a time of similar uncertainty when the Trump administration was ramping up sanctions on China and the UK\u0027s future in the UK was unclear.Why bitcoin\u0027s bumpy revolution is only just beginningCryptocurrency trader and author Glen Goodman rejected any relation between bitcoin\u0027s price and the US assassination of\u0026nbspSoleimani, or the subsequent Iranian missile strikes on US military bases in Iraq.Bitcoin was already in a strong uptrend before the missiles hit, Mr Goodman wrote on Twitter following the attacks.\u0026nbspGold rose and stocks fell initially, but traders soon relaxed, so stocks recovered and gold fell. Bitcoin stayed high because its rise is not Iran-related.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

will be a significant reallocation of capital,” he wrote.BlackRock\u0026nbspalso acknowledged that investing sustainably has the potential to offer better returns to investors.\u0026nbspCreated with

The remaining $5 trillion of its funds are passive, meaning it\u0026nbspsimply allocates clients’\u0026nbspmoney\u0026nbspto a basket of stocks and bonds weighted in such a way as to track indexes such as the FTSE 100, for example.Investment giant threatens to pull funds from gunmakersBecause oil and gas companies account for a significant slice of major stock markets, BlackRock will remain heavily invested in them unless it makes further policy changes.Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction said: “Larry Fink talks a lot about companies’ purpose, but there are questions left unanswered about what BlackRock’s own purpose is, and how its stewardship delivers the social, environmental, and financial performance that its clients are looking for.“While we welcome its commitment to improve transparency of its stewardship activities, for far too long the asset manager has kept everyone in the dark about the companies it was meeting with, the topics discussed, and most importantly the outcome of those engagements.\u0026nbsp“But we might not like what we see when we open the door on these activities: BlackRock’s current voting disclosures on climate issues give little comfort that it will vote in a manner fitting of the climate crisis.”Ms Martin added: “BlackRock’s coal estment decision is yet another significant blow to the already dying market.”The ShareAction\u0026nbspcharity is calling on the fund manager to go further by using its voting rights to pressure banks to stop financing coal.BlackRock’s announcement comes a day after almost all of Britain’s top universities committed to selling their shares in fossil fuel companies after pressure from eco-conscious students who have occupied buildings and carried out hunger strikes.\u0026nbspCharlie Kronick, climate finance campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said:\u0026nbsp“BlackRock’s announcement this morning is an acknowledgement of the culpability of the financial sector for the climate emergency, their responsibility to fix it, and the impossibility of carrying on business as usual now that the world is awake to the crisis we have created.\u0026nbsp“Barclays Bank and other UK institutions financing fossil fuel expansion need to step up and do the same, and do it quickly, if they want to avoid becoming the target of unprecedented pressure from activists and investors to end their ongoing funding of the climate emergency.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

portfolio that it will start offloading investments it considers to be a climate change risk, including thermal coal.BlackRock\u0026nbspchief executive Larry Fink wrote to bosses of many of the world’s largest corporations to tell them that the climate crisis is about to trigger a “fundamental reshaping of finance”.Mr Fink, who has faced criticism for a perceived failure to act on climate change, said rising global temperatures were altering the long-term prospects of companies.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“In the near future – and sooner than most anticipate – there will be a significant reallocation of capital,” he wrote.BlackRock\u0026nbspalso acknowledged that investing sustainably has the potential to offer better returns to investors.\u0026nbspCreated with

believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing,” the company wrote in a separate letter to clients.The company said it would begin exiting industries that are most at risk as the world shifts to a low-carbon future, including thermal coal.BlackRock’s stance will pile pressure on other asset managers to reassess their own approaches to climate risks.It is perhaps the clearest indication that asset managers, as custodians of a significant chunk of the world’s wealth, have recognised the key role they could play in tackling the climate crisis.But campaigners remained sceptical about BlackRock’s commitment to protecting the planet, preferring to wait for actions rather than words.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBlackRock remains one of the world’s largest backers of fossil fuel companies and has consistently voted against shareholder resolutions designed to push company boards to limit their impact on the climate.That has frustrated campaigners who see BlackRock as a key potential influencer of corporate policies.The new approach applies only to BlackRock’s\u0026nbsp$1.8 trillion of actively managed assets. The remaining $5 trillion of its funds are passive, meaning it\u0026nbspsimply allocates clients’\u0026nbspmoney\u0026nbspto a basket of stocks and bonds weighted in such a way as to track indexes such as the FTSE 100, for example.Investment giant threatens to pull funds from gunmakersBecause oil and gas companies account for a significant slice of major stock markets, BlackRock will remain heavily invested in them unless it makes further policy changes.Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction said: “Larry Fink talks a lot about companies’ purpose, but there are questions left unanswered about what BlackRock’s own purpose is, and how its stewardship delivers the social, environmental, and financial performance that its clients are looking for.“While we welcome its commitment to improve transparency of its stewardship activities, for far too long the asset manager has kept everyone in the dark about the companies it was meeting with, the topics discussed, and most importantly the outcome of those engagements.\u0026nbsp“But we might not like what we see when we open the door on these activities: BlackRock’s current voting disclosures on climate issues give little comfort that it will vote in a manner fitting of the climate crisis.”Ms Martin added: “BlackRock’s coal estment decision is yet another significant blow to the already dying market.”The ShareAction\u0026nbspcharity is calling on the fund manager to go further by using its voting rights to pressure banks to stop financing coal.BlackRock’s announcement comes a day after almost all of Britain’s top universities committed to selling their shares in fossil fuel companies after pressure from eco-conscious students who have occupied buildings and carried out hunger strikes.\u0026nbspCharlie Kronick, climate finance campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said:\u0026nbsp“BlackRock’s announcement this morning is an acknowledgement of the culpability of the financial sector for the climate emergency, their responsibility to fix it, and the impossibility of carrying on business as usual now that the world is awake to the crisis we have created.\u0026nbsp“Barclays Bank and other UK institutions financing fossil fuel expansion need to step up and do the same, and do it quickly, if they want to avoid becoming the target of unprecedented pressure from activists and investors to end their ongoing funding of the climate emergency.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Such burst gravitational ways could be an important way of doing so – but are yet to be found, and scientists don\u0027t know exactly what they will look like.Star is acting strangely and may be about to explode, astronomers sayLIGO describes them as the gravitational waves that go bump in the night, and scientists admit there is little understanding of where they may come from. While astrophysicists have long predicted they may happen, there is too little information about the parts of the universe that would spawn them to say when they might arrive or how they will appear when they do.Searching for burst gravitational waves requires being utterly open-minded, the LIGO website reads. For these kinds of gravitational waves, scientists must\u0026nbsprecognize\u0026nbspa pattern of signals even when such a pattern has not been predicted or\u0026nbspmodeled\u0026nbsp(what we think a signal may look like) before. If you don’t know what you’re looking for, it’s really hard to find it.While this makes searching for burst gravitational waves difficult, detecting them has the greatest potential to reveal revolutionary information about the Universe.Some have speculated that the wave could have come from Betelgeuse, a nearby star that is behaving oddly and could be about to explode into a supernova. But that star still appears to be in place, and the wave does not seem to have come from the correct part of the sky.Michael Merrifield,\u0026nbspprofessor of astronomy at the University of Nottingham, described the event as weird on Twitter, and suggested that further observation should give more detail on where it had come from.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can remember sitting next to him\u0026nbspon a bed and I touched his arm. He turned to me and he said: “Can’t you see your father is crying.” It was many years later that I realised he was crying because of Biafra. That was 50 years ago today. I didn’t see my father cry again. He was mourning\u0026nbspthe loss of the Biafra\u0026nbspdream.For me and for many of the\u0026nbspdiaspora, Biafra is a presence that haunts us. It is a part of our history that is not spoken about and yet we try to make sense of it by reading, watching plays and attending lectures. All of this in an attempt to understand this dream that was on the cusp of being realised and yet failed so painfully.I was two when the war began and four when it ended. This\u0026nbspwas a civil war in Nigeria fought between the Nigerian government and the eastern region of Nigeria. Predominantly the home of the Igbo people, the eastern region – in response to violence and massacres, as well as political, economic, cultural and religious tensions – declared itself the State of Biafra on 30 May 1967 and seceded from Nigeria.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesNigeria was a creation of the British in 1914. It was established for colonial administrative convenience. It merged three separate cultures into one. To the north were the Fulani and Hausa-speaking people, often nomadic, principally of the Muslim faith. To the west of the River Niger were the Yoruba, largely farmers living under a rigid monarchical system and Christian. To the east were the predominantly Igbo-speaking people, also Christian, but with a strain of Judaism and more republican in their outlook. Nigeria is not (and never has been) a cohesive whole. However,\u0026nbspin 1960, Nigeria was granted independence. Violence and coups ensued.\u0026nbspNigeria’s hate speech and social media bills aren’t what they seemIn response to Biafra’s secession, the Nigerian government, backed by the former colonial master, countered with a brutal war. Millions of Biafrans died, most as a result of the deliberate government policy of starvation. From July 1967 to January 1970,\u0026nbspBiafrans fought to free themselves from Nigerian oppression and from the lingering vestiges of poisonous colonialism. Biafra was starved into submission.\u0026nbspBiafra was, and still is, a powerful vision of freedom and self-determination.I have a deep and abiding rootedness in\u0026nbspBiafra and the UK. My father studied at the LSE in the early 1960s and his first job as an academic was in England. I was born in the UK and brought up in two different cultures. To me, Biafra is a dream and a shadow. It is a dream of my father.\u0026nbspI remember bouncing into the kitchen aged nine or 10 (we were living in Norwich at the time) and informing my mother that I was Biafran because Dad said so, and she told me (quite rightly) that Biafra does not exist. I ignored her. This was 1975, five years after the war had ended but my father still dreamed. He was Biafran and so were we. At least once a week we had to eat fufu, a traditional Biafran meal. As far as my father was concerned,\u0026nbspfufu, like our Biafran identity, was both compulsory and necessary and he made sure that we knew this. My sisters and me would hanker after fish and chips!\u0026nbspMy father died 17\u0026nbspyears ago. We flew his body home to be buried. It went without saying that he needed to be laid to rest in the place that was truly home for him. My father’s tie to the home country was a tie to the dream of Biafra. He never stopped believing in Biafra. It was a passion and a dream that consumed him. His passion for Biafra shaped the way my two sisters and I were brought up. His passion for Biafra lingers in my life and has influenced the way I interact with the world and the way in which I struggle and thirst for justice.But Biafra is also a shadow. Not just for me, but for many people. It is the shadow of our past in Nigeria as a nation, whether we acknowledge it or not. The shadow of Biafra exists in the memories of the war and the many stories that are told about it behind closed doors.\u0026nbspThe shadows and dreams of Biafra\u0026nbspare invisible but still very profound.\u0026nbspHis passion for\u0026nbspBiafra\u0026nbspshaped the way my two sisters and I were brought up. His passion for\u0026nbspBiafra\u0026nbsplingers in my life and has influenced the way in which I thirst for justiceDad brought us up to believe in Biafra. He was always deeply passionate about Biafra and our home town of Mbaise. When I was 12, we moved to Nigeria from the UK. Dad wanted us to attend school in Nigeria. We lived in a small town called Idah on the eastern bank of the River Niger in the middle belt region of Nigeria.\u0026nbspMy father had unwritten rules. We were not allowed to study in the north. We were not allowed to marry anybody from the north and he gave us strict instructions to marry from Mbaise in the southeast of Nigeria. Needless to say, that was the one time I disobeyed him because I eventually married a Yoruban man from\u0026nbspthe west of Nigeria.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe furthest we ever got to the north was a town called Jos and I think we drove through Abuja once. As far as my father was concerned, northern Nigeria was a no-go area. He was living in the shadow of Biafra and when we think about the way so many Biafrans were killed in the north before the war and what is happening today with Boko Haram, I can understand why he felt so strongly about this.\u0026nbspSome years after his death\u0026nbspI remember rebuking a cousin of mine when I heard that she had moved to northern Nigeria. That fear and the shadow were very much alive for me even though I was living in London.\u0026nbspThese shadows\u0026nbspbecame part of our day-to-day lives, affecting our\u0026nbspchoices and decisions. \u0026nbspAs an adult I can see more deeply how the dream of Biafra has shaped who I am. I am a priest, but I am also a community activist. My thirst for justice and the need for a better world was nurtured by my father and his dream of Biafra.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Biafra war – in photos Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Biafran man trains with a dummy rifle during the simulation of a confrontation with the enemy in a field of BiafraBiafran rebel soldiers during an attack to take the city of Ikot Ekpene from the Nigerian troops on 11 August 1968A group of mothers and their babies waiting at the Enugu Civilian HospitalA Nigerian army soldier wounded on his neck is carried by his comrades on the pannier rack of a bicycleRefugees walk on a road as they flee the city of Aba, to go to Umuahia, the new capital of the Republic of BiafraA Biafran mother and her starving baby during the famine resulting from the Biafran War Colonel Odumegwu Emeka Ojukwu, the leader of the breakaway Republic of Biafra, delivers a press conferenceSinger-songwriter John Lennon on the telephone during a press conference held after he returned his MBE to the Queen in protest against the war in Biafra and the British support of the American action in VietnamLieutenant colonel Ogbonnaya Oji during a battle of Nigerian Civil War.A starving Biafran child sits by a pile of yamsEnglish model and actress Jean Shrimpton joins a group of anti-war protestors campaigning to end the killing of civilians in Biafra and the Nigerian Civil War, on the steps of the Shaftesbury Memorial in Piccadilly CircusBiafran injured men lie on a street of Ikoi as the overcrowed hospitals of the town couldn\u0027t take care of all the injured peopleA group of mothers and their babies at the Enugu Civilian HospitalBiafran refugees gather after the storming of the city of NnewiRefugees walk on a road as they flee the city of AbaNigerian leader General Yakubu Gowon (rigjt) welcomes United Nations Secretary General U Thant (left) who flied into Lagos to hold talks over the continuing Biafran refugee crisiA Biafran man trains with a dummy rifle during the simulation of a confrontation with the enemy in a field of BiafraBiafran rebel soldiers during an attack to take the city of Ikot Ekpene from the Nigerian troops on 11 August 1968A group of mothers and their babies waiting at the Enugu Civilian HospitalA Nigerian army soldier wounded on his neck is carried by his comrades on the pannier rack of a bicycleRefugees walk on a road as they flee the city of Aba, to go to Umuahia, the new capital of the Republic of BiafraA Biafran mother and her starving baby during the famine resulting from the Biafran War Colonel Odumegwu Emeka Ojukwu, the leader of the breakaway Republic of Biafra, delivers a press conferenceSinger-songwriter John Lennon on the telephone during a press conference held after he returned his MBE to the Queen in protest against the war in Biafra and the British support of the American action in VietnamLieutenant colonel Ogbonnaya Oji during a battle of Nigerian Civil War.A starving Biafran child sits by a pile of yamsEnglish model and actress Jean Shrimpton joins a group of anti-war protestors campaigning to end the killing of civilians in Biafra and the Nigerian Civil War, on the steps of the Shaftesbury Memorial in Piccadilly CircusBiafran injured men lie on a street of Ikoi as the overcrowed hospitals of the town couldn\u0027t take care of all the injured peopleA group of mothers and their babies at the Enugu Civilian HospitalBiafran refugees gather after the storming of the city of NnewiRefugees walk on a road as they flee the city of AbaNigerian leader General Yakubu Gowon (rigjt) welcomes United Nations Secretary General U Thant (left) who flied into Lagos to hold talks over the continuing Biafran refugee crisiDuring the war, my father was away campaigning and trying to raise money for an organisation called The Friends of Biafra. His dream was so powerful and the needs of Biafra so urgent that he simply had to leave his family at this crucial time and respond. My youngest sister was born then, but Biafra had to come first.His thirst for justice and his activism shaped my own thirst for these things. At eight, I was raising money to buy presents for elderly people in a nearby home. At 10\u0026nbspI was joining sponsored sleep outs for Amnesty International. At 12 I was writing about Steve Biko. The dream of my father continues to shape and influence me in my contemporary social justice activities.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspBiafra\u0026nbspis part of who I am and it is part of my family heritage. I remember the stories about the war where my relatives fled from town to town to avoid the approaching Nigerian soldiers. I remember the stories of what they did to surviveBiafra is part of who I am. It\u0026nbspis part of my family heritage. I remember the stories about the war where my relatives fled from town to town to avoid the approaching Nigerian soldiers. I remember the stories of what they did to survive.\u0026nbspI had a cousin who went by the name of Surpriser.\u0026nbsp His real name was Goddy and he fought in the Biafran army. During the war he hid the family’s valuables and property by digging a deep hole somewhere on family land. After the war he recovered everything and from that time onwards he was known as “Surpriser”.\u0026nbspAs a teenager, I always thought he was rather odd and often under the influence of something but I think the fighting affected him in more ways than we ever fully understood.\u0026nbspI wish he was still alive so that I could speak to him and ask him what happened.\u0026nbspAs an adult as I look back over my life I can see how Biafra has shaped my life in both dreams and shadows. And I know that many of us in the Biafran diaspora have similar stories and experiences.\u0026nbspIt is now 50 years after the end of the war and I think it is right for us to remember, because in doing so we honour our ancestors. We honour those who died during the war often from starvation, and we honour those who fought for Biafra.Internet praises Miss Nigeria’s reaction to losing Miss WorldNineteen pregnant women rescued from ‘baby factories’ in NigeriaMet Police officer on Big Brother in Nigeria ‘without permission’I think that there is still the need for answers and dialogue about the war. I think it is a shame that Nigeria has never seen the need to have such dialogue or some kind of public acknowledgement or remembrance of the war. These dreams and shadows will never disappear. They need to be embraced and they need to be acknowledged because these dreams and shadows abound today.\u0026nbspThe people waving the Biafran flag today in protest are mostly people who were young children during the war and some were not even born at that time. They wave the Biafran flag because the dreams and shadows of Biafra are as strong today as they were when my father had them. These dreams and shadows affect Nigeria today the shadows will never disappear and the dreams will never die. The Nigerian government needs to realise that silence is not an answer to the truth.There is a passage in the Bible where God asks Cain “Where is your brother Abel?” Cain tries to rebuff God, but God says: “Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.”\u0026nbspThe blood that was shed for Biafra is perhaps part of the reason why these dreams and shadows still exist. It is important for us to remember Biafra but it is also important for Nigeria to remember Biafra and for the United Kingdom to remember the part it played in the cruel devastation of the Biafran people.\u0026nbspAs for me and people like me, we will continue to remember, especially through stories and plays, films and drama, dialogue and reflection and through the activism for Biafra that still continues today.\u0026nbspLet us continue to remember. Let us continue to dream.\u0026nbspIgbo Kwenu!\u0026nbspBiafra Kwenu!The Reverend Ijeoma Ajibade is a Church of England priest, ministering at Southwark Cathedral and\u0026nbspSt Philip’s, Earl’s CourtRead about the inhumane tactics of the Biafran\u0026nbspwar, which ended 50 years ago today, hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex PollardSpeaking on France’s RTL radio, festival organiser Thierry Fremaux said it wasn’t a political decision, but noted that black artists are underrepresented in the cinema world.Many of Lee’s films have been shown at Cannes, and his BlacKkKlansman won a major prize at Cannes two years ago.\u0026nbspThe rest of the jury members will be announced in April.Without explicitly mentioning Lee’s career-long fight against racism or other political views, the festival said Lee’s “perspective is more valuable than ever” and that “Cannes is a natural homeland and a global sounding board for those who (re)awaken minds and question our stances and fixed ideas”.Ladj Ly, whose film Les Miserables\u0026nbspechoes some of Lee’s work and tackles tensions between police and minorities in a poor Paris suburb, hailed the move by festival organisers. Les Miserables\u0026nbspscreened at Cannes last year and won an Oscar nomination Monday for best international film.The honorary president of French black rights group CRAN\u0026nbspalso welcomed Lee’s\u0026nbspappointment.“The arts world considers itself above questions of discrimination,” Louis-Georges Tin told The Associated Press. “But the #MeToo campaign showed that sexism is all too present in the arts world. And racism is too.”Tin expressed hope that Lee’s role in Cannes could prompt the French cinema world to take a hard look at how it treats minorities and France’s own colonial history. In French cinema, he said, “it’s always the blacks who make you laugh and Arabs who scare you”.Last year’s Cannes jury president was Mexican director Alejandro Inarritu, and the festival’s top prize went to Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite,\u0026nbspwho was nominated this week for Best International Film at the Oscars.Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For instance, electric planes are a potential in the not too distant future,” the health secretary said.However, asked when they would come in, he admitted: “I’m actually here to talk about the health service – you will have to get the transport secretary on.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“I’m told that electric planes are on the horizon, if that’s not pushing the metaphor too far.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I want to rebuild our country and the Labour Party.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon is standing as a continuity candidate, flaunting his loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn and saying it is wrong to blame the current leader for the election defeatThe ballot simply asks members for a “yes” or “no” response to the question “should Momentum follow the NCG recommendation to endorse Rebecca Long-Bailey as the next leader of the Labour Party”. The same question is also asked of Ms Rayner for the deputy role.Michael Chessum, a Momentum member, who was on the steering committee of the group between 2016 and 2017, said: “Ludicrously, we only have one option for each position. This is a joke, and you should vote No on principle. Even if, like me, you might end up voting for one of the chosen candidates.”He\u0026nbsptold The Independent: “This entire situation is tragic and tell you a lot about what has happened to Corbynism. In 2015, we promised ‘a new kind of politics’ and to democratise the party, and Momentum was set up as a grassroots activist organisation.\u0026nbsp“But a strategy of command and control took over in the leader’s office, open selections was blocked, and Momentum had its internal democracy abolished in order to become a top-down mobilising vehicle. If we, the left, are not s of democracy, we will deserve to lose.”The journalist and Labour activist Owen Jones also criticised the process. “Momentum’s ruling body went for the worst of all worlds. They should have either said, look this is a representative democracy, you’ve elected to exercise our judgement, and accordingly we back Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner, he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It undermines the candidates favoured by the leadership – they need the legitimacy of a democratic process.“No one believes Rebecca Long-Bailey would not win the democratic backing of the membership but it seems anything other than North Korean levels of grassroots support was deemed unacceptable by the leadership”.\u0026nbspWhen the organisation announced at the weekend it was endorsing the candidates at an executive level, Laura Parker, the group’s former national coordinator, who quit just after the general election, said: “Although I am pleased Momentum’s governing body accepted the principle of balloting its members on the leadership, I’m sorry they seem to have decided in advance what the answer is.”Lisa Nandy boosted by endorsement from National Union of MineworkersShe added: “Members should be able to choose from all leader and deputy candidates.”Momentum said they made the recommendation for Ms Long-Bailey on the basis “she is the only candidate committed to advancing the transformative agenda established by Jeremy Corbyn and furthering democratisation of the party”.\u0026nbspThe group added: “The NCG also voted to support Angela Rayner for the next deputy leader of the Labour Party.

Others can get it manually by going to Windows Update in the computer\u0027s settings.Microsoft typically releases security and other updates once a month and waited until Tuesday to disclose the flaw and the NSA\u0027s involvement. Microsoft and the NSA both declined to say when the agency notified the company.The agency shared the vulnerability with Microsoft quickly and responsibly, Neal Ziring, technical director of the NSA\u0027s cybersecurity directorate, said in a blog post Tuesday.Priscilla Moriuchi, who retired from the NSA in 2017 after running its East Asia and Pacific operations, said this is a good example of the constructive role that the NSA can play in improving global information security. Moriuchi, now an analyst at the U.S. cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it\u0027s likely a reflection of changes made in 2017 to how the U.S. determines whether to disclose a major vulnerability or exploit it for intelligence purposes.The revamping of what\u0027s known as the Vulnerability Equities Process put more emphasis on disclosing unpatched vulnerabilities whenever possible to protect core internet systems and the U.S. economy and general public.Those changes happened after a group calling itself Shadow Brokers released a trove of high-level hacking tools stolen from the NSA.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She didn’t meet them.Even the abdication of Edward VIII over Mrs Simpson, together below, was at Government and Church level.To have documents prepared in advance does not surprise me. The Queen has said she wants this sorted out and without delay.Many have called this an abdication and in one sense it is. Harry and Meghan expect to still have a handle on royal duty but also to lead a private le.What they mean by living financially independent, I don’t know. They aren’t financially independent now — they get £.- million from the Prince Of Wales and about five per cent from the Sovereign Grant.Harry is reasonably wealthy but not necessarily in cash flow. The sums he inherited from his mother and great grandmother have been invested.Meghan has some means but to live the sort of lestyle they are used to takes a lot of money.It is conceivable Charles could cut the money he gives to Harry —he gives him any at all. Being a dad, he probably will.But there are tax implications — particularlythere are handouts.Security has also to be considered. Harry is a prince of the United Kingdom, his grandmother head of state and father heir.The atmosphere at the meeting will be, up to a point, heated. But people won’t lose their tempers.The Queen is pragmatic. She understands problems people have but Harry will be fully aware of her displeasure. To go off half-cocked as he and Meghan did is unacceptable.The question is how dare they do that. She signed up for this.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives. By December , another baby announcement is likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are rich beyond the wildest dreams of almost everyone in the UK.They are more than capable of paying for a few bodyguards. Andthey find themselves struggling, they could always cut down on the private jets.The Queen, Charles and Wills must be firm: the Sussexes have made their bed. Now they’ve got to lie in it.A CIVILISED nation treats its veterans with respect.Which is why we were delighted when Boris Johnson won the election on a manesto promising to end witch hunt prosecutions against ageing former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland.But to get Stormont up and running, the Prime Minister has brokered a deal with Sinn Fein which risks opening up new probes into thousands of Troubles veterans. This would be morally indefensible and politically mad.Yes, a working government in Northern Ireland would be a good thing. But the safety and wellbeing of our elderly veterans is too big a price tag.And given Boris won the election by being a proud patriot, it makes political sense for him to stand by the armed forces through thick and thin.If the PM is to hold the hard-earned trust of new Conservative voters, he must never give way to those who would put our old soldiers in the dock.IT would be fair to assume that anyone injecting plastic into someone’s face should have some qualications to do so.But a strange loophole in the law means that though Botox is classied as a medicine in Britain, dermal fillers aren’t covered by any regulation.A staggering  per cent of facial fillers are performed by people with no medical training, often in unsanitary conditions — with devastating results.Which is why The Sun’s Fabulous brand is launching the Had Our Fill campaign, urging for a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic fillers, and raising awareness to help women make safer, more informed choices.We’ve had our fill of dodgy fillers.

Why let reality spoil the narrative These claims made about the “racist” treatment of Meghan at the hands of the British Press are incredibly thin.The same non-examples are recycled over and over again. You have probably seen them quoteda thousand times.There is that Daily Mail piece from , when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was “ straight outta Compton”.At the time, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA.Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with “racialised forms of crime”, meaning gangs.That is one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the dference in Harry and Meghan’s social backgrounds.If Harry had been dating a white, working-class woman from Manchester’s Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.Another favourite is that weird throwaway line Boris Johnson’s sister Rachel wrote, in a laudatory piece on Meghan, about the mixed-race American actress bringing some “rich and exotic DNA” to the pale Windsor bloodline. That is more cringey than racist.Several pieces have cited a single phrase in a Sarah Vine column for the Mail — she said she had a “niggling worry” about the royal couple’s engagement photo — as a bigoted dog whistle. That is, quite frankly, mental.Such is the lack of actual examples of the Press being racist about Meghan.The only leg this argument has left to stand on is that the sheer volume of criticism sent Meghan’s way was disproportionate.Racism is the only explanation for it. It’s an argument based purely on unveriable speculation and imputing motives. It is also b*****ks.When the couple first got together, the coverage was gushing across the board.It was only when Meghan and Harry started on their ious virtue-signalling cru-sades — such as jetting around to lecture on climate change — that people’s backs went up.That the couple had already been beefing with the Press probably didn’t help either.In , way before Meghan became a figure in our culture wars, Harry issued a remarkable statement rebuking journalists for the “racial undertones” of their pieces.That these privileged royals, kept in the lap of luxury at taxpayers’ expense, began to develop a deep-seated victim complex only heightened the resentment towards them.Last year, Meghan told ITV public le was a “struggle” and she was shocked that “not many people have askedI’m OK”. Poor princess.This picture of privilege is who the liberal Left has spent the best part of three years defending.Even supposed republicans have — after a bit of anti-royal throat-clearing — defended Harry and Meghan to the hilt and helped con- struct this absurd narrative that they are the victims of establishment racism.This says far more about the prejudices of liberal-Left commentators than it does about the tabloid Press. They routinely suggest Meghan’s supposed mistreatment in Brexit Britain is no coincidence.They think Britain is a foul place full of foul people, brainwashed by foul news- papers to hate the wonderful Duchess of Sussex and the brilliant European Union.What the liberal elite’s Meghanmania shows us is that, for all their posturing against right-wingers, monarchy and the old aristocracy, they are comfortable with the plebs being led, instructed and hectored by our betters.They would just rather it was woke people doing it, like Harry and Meghan. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One of the many reasons I love @wowcher.But the mystery deal has been slammed by furious travellers claiming they were forced to shell out more than the advertised £ deal.Holidaymakers are put into a Lottery-style draw for holidays ranging from two to seven nights based on two people sharing.Destinations include New York, Dubai, Las Vegas, Bali, Thailand, Ibiza, Rome and Disneyland Paris but customers dont know where they are going until after they have booked.The deal includesflights and a hotel stay - but is based on departures from Stansted, Gatwick, Southend, Luton and Heathrow.This means some customers end up paying over the odds when they wish to change airports, flight times or add checked baggage to their trip.One Wowcher customer wrote: Or you could or you could end up having just spent £ on a trip to Dublin for  people for my daughters th birthday and be totally shafted and not get what we’ve paid for. Currently waiting for a manager to ring me from @wowcher but wouldn’t touch this company with a barge pole !!!The trips include flights and accommodation, and some are even all-inclusive.You have to buy at least two vouchers, at £ each, and then you go into a draw to win your destination.Everyone will get a holiday, but you just dont know where youre going until the draw happens.But customers who want to fly from an airport that isnt Stansted, Gatwick, Southend, Luton and Heathrow will have to pay extra.It also costs more to change flight times or dates.One user said: My friend did it for us. We ended up with Venice! But then they were arguing and trying to change it to Budapest.Then the hotel they wanted to put us in was a total e !!! Also needed more money for the flights. Was a total joke ! We ended up not going.Another said: Same happened to me! She should stop promoting it as I only did it on her recommendation as usually don’t fall for it.I’m fuming as I paid more with the vouchers than I wouldI booked it myself. Guy on the phone was pushy for a decision.Last year, a fuming customer accused Wowcher of running a scam after booking a £ mystery holiday deal - only for the destinations to be sold out.Twitter user Will, , originally paid £ per person for a weekend break with his girlfriend.Their holiday was set to be between July and August, with the deal costing slightly more than the normal £ as it was peak time.However, despite being told initially that they would be going to Venice, they were then told it had sold out, and would have to go another time of year.Some lucky punters do end up with a dream holiday though - one man was lucky enough to pay £ for the mystery holiday and ended up spending four nights in Dubai.The Sun Online has contacted Wowcher and Scarletts people for comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They also accuse Meghan of scheming to use friends to pressure UK journalists into dropping stories about her.She is suing the newspaper for damages after it published a leaked letter she wrote to Thomas three months after her May  wedding.

I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done. And at the same time, because she’s his daughter, she has a lot of sympathy for him.”But the MoS says the information “could only have comefrom the claimant, not least because it presented events entirely from her perspective.It adds: “The People interview depicted Mr Markle as having acted unreasonably and unlovingly, having cold-shouldered his daughter, and being solely to blame for the estrangement. This was a one-sided and or misleading and  narrative.”The MoS says Meghan’s letter was an attack on Mr Markle, accusing him of “breaking her heart, manufacturing pain, being paranoid, fabricating stories, attacking Prince Harry and continually lying.”The documents also say frail Thomas, now , has still not met grandson Archie. And they allege he did not even receive a “get well soon” card from Meghan after emergency heart surgery.The documents state Thomas was taken into hospital in Mexico for surgery on May  — five days before Meghan’s wedding — and he texted her the same day to say he was unable to make the wedding.They state: “He told the Claimant he loved her and wished her the best. He sent a follow-up message asking who would ‘be giving her away’ and sayingshe really needed him he would come and that he was sorry ‘about all this’.”Thomas got a text response signed “Love M and H” but it read “asit was from Prince Harry”, the documents say.It is claimed the text set about “admonishing Mr Markle for talking to the press and telling him to stop — and accusing Mr Markle of causing hurt to his daughter. The text did not ask how the surgical procedure had gone or how Mr Markle was or send him good wishes.“Mr Markle was deeply hurt and responded with a curt message: ‘I’ve done nothing to hurt you Meghan or anyone .

And it states Meghan “stayed silent” on the issue.Thomas claims he paid off Meghan’s student loans even after she became a star of TV show Suits, the defence documents state.They add: “He had paid her private school fees.

For how much did they really know about each other before walking down the aisle Prince William apparently advised his more impetuous brother to wait so he could really get to know his American bride first, but Harry took umbrage and didn’t listen.Perhapshe had, he might have worked out in advance that an independent spirit joining such a restrictive institution wasn’t going to end well.Instead, they leapt before they looked and, with the “-month bride” having packed her bags already, have saddled the -year-old Queen with yet another constitutional crisis.Back in , I wrote a piece defending Meghan after she was criticised by old school friend Ninaki Priddy for being “calculated in the way she handled people and relationships” and a “curator of a beautul le”.But following the lavish baby shower, the jet-setting with A-listers and the swt jettisoning of inconveniently outspoken family members, the latter sentiment now rings true.And, of course, becoming a member of the most famous royal family in the world was the cherry on the top of that beautul le.But Meghan soon discovered it was nothing like the membership of her beloved Soho House.The rooms are draughty, the decor chintzy and, instead of reading the morning papers in your cashmere loungewear, you have to rise early, put on a frock and make your way to some rain-lashed outpost to open the new wing of a community centre where “live your best le” sentiments, however well-meaning, aren’t required.Here’s what is required as a member of the British Royal Family: Turn up on time, shake hands, smile, say little more than “have you come far ” Repeat.Not because the royals don’t have anything to say. They do, and air their views in private.But in public, their job is to shine a light on whatever project they’re visiting, not themselves. To show — via action, not virtue-signalling statements — a strong sense of duty.And inthey get to keep their ious mansions, hundreds of staff, personal bodyguards etc without any whf of civil unrest.That’s the deal.But those still in Meghan’s social circle glowingly describe her as organised, focused, and opinionated — very much an independent woman used to having her voice heard.As Prince Harry told courtiers just before their wedding: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”An admirable quality when it comes to breaking through the glass ceiling of corporate le or securing the best table in the best restaurant, perhaps.But the monarchy is an institution steeped in hundreds of years of tradition, and Meghan — who claimed she “didn’t know much” about Harry when they first met — clearly thought she’d mould it to her way of thinking . . . then rapidly discovered that it ain’t for turning.Not that The Queen didn’t try very hard to accommodate the wants and needs of the newly anointed Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Contrary to royal tradition, they were permitted to keep the christening of baby Archie as a private affair and, despite there being a perfectly nice home at Kensington Palace they could have used, a publicly funded, £.million renovation of Frogmore Cottage was authorised.A “cottage” I might add, that used to be five homes but has now been knocked in to one because they managed to dodge the usual ban that prevents such moves because of the UK’s housing crisis.Shortly after, Prince Charles launched his blueprint to try to solve the dilemma faced by millions of young people struggling to find a home of their own. Oh the irony. And after all that, they now want to use it part-time as they flit back and forth across the Atlantic.Meghan is feeling disillusioned and homesick. We get it, and sympathise.But let’s not pretend, as some claim, that she’s been practically pitchforked off this island by racist bigots.This is not a racist country and, besides, the British public initially greeted her engagement and later marriage to Harry with unbridled joy.We love Harry. He’s a thoroughly decent person and deserves particular praise for the work he’s done with the Armed Forces, both while serving and afterwards.No, the disconnect has come from the fact that Meghan is still a Hollywood celebrity at heart and, consequently, never truly settled in her often boring and restrictive new role.She misses the relative freedom of her old le, not to mention her family and friends.Again, we get it. But was it really necessary to flee these shores asescaping for her le Clearly besotted with her, Harry faces the stark decision of giving her what she wants or losing her for ever. Or perhaps he’s genuinely sick of royal le and wants out too.If so, let’s wave goodbye and wish them luck.But. The have-cake-and-eat-it plan to stop being a “senior royal” and just dip in and out of duties that suit them simply isn’t going to work.SussexRoyal — which Harry and Meghan have registered as an official trademark for everything from “emotional support services” to clothing and magazines — is a title and privilege that comes with duties and conditions attached, not a brand, be it charitable or otherwise.The future of the monarchy depends on the goodwill, support and interest level of the public, and a recent survey showed that, while the majority have no issue with their decision to go, they were strongly against any continued taxpayer funding of their lavish lestyle.So— as early indicators go — The Queen allows Harry and Meghan to call the shots while keeping their royal titles, their taxpayer-funded security and an allowance from the Duchy of Cornwall, then one suspects this will be discussed by students for centuries to come as the turning point at which the British monarchy began its steady decline to irrelevance and, ultimately, abolition.MOVIE mega-star Will Smith popped in to the retirement party of a woman he last met  years ago.Anita Scipio was the receptionist at a US radio station when Will arrived for one of his first interviews as a young actor and he’s never forgotten how nice she was to him.“My favorite moments on the road are the ones where I can connect with people like @anitascipio,” -year-old Will told his Instagram followers before he walked in to the station to give her a hug.In the days before social media, someone who worked at his record company Sony told me that whenever he was in town, Will would tour the building, from post room to boardroom, giving time to everyone.He’s that rare creature, a star on screen and off.Some of today’s petulant slebs should watch and learn.FORMER psychiatric nurse Susan Evans is launching a landmark legal case to challenge consent issues around the provision of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for under-s.She argues that children should be protected from “experimental” and “invasive medical treatment”, not least because “some children are referred despite having autism, being homosexual or suffering some form of trauma or sexual abuse”.Speaking on Radio , she added that children as young as nine were being asked to consent “to a completely experimental treatment for which long-term consequences are not known”.But gender ersity advocates warn that “a loss to trans youth is a loss to all”.Time will tell the outcome of her case but, meanwhile, in unrelated comments, I note that the actor Rupert Everett says he spent most of his early childhood wanting “to be a girl”.He adored his mother, aunt and grandmother, didn’t like men, and adds: “I loved necklaces and bras and all those kinds of things.”Then, when he reached , he “didn’t want to be a girl any more. I really enjoyed being a homosexual”.The case in point, perhaps, for treading very carefully indeed with pre-teens.POLICE officers will be required to have degrees from this year – a move that could remove , recruits from the front line while they complete their studies.Sigh.

Why don’t they   If Harry wants to leave then he should be free to do so like anyone  on the understanding that all titles and payments will be forfeited.  It is to be admiredpeople want to stand on their own two feet.Wendy Lively from Hexham, NorthumberlandHOW right to call the Meghan and Harry crisis Megxit.

In my opinion it’s all about ego.  Meghan waltzed in here expecting to eclipse William and Kate in the public’s eyes but she badly misjudged the whole scenario.

While I have bought several mobile phones, I have never gone shopping for an entire telecoms network.But surely there must be other potential contractors. Don’t we have a telecoms industry of our own It doesn’t say much for the Government’s privatisation of BTit is not in the running for this sort of work.What about our own Vodafone, which I thought was one of the world leaders in mobile phone technology Evendepriving Huawei of the work meant we had to wait a little longer or pay a little extra to download a movie to our phones, that would surely be a reasonable price to pay for protecting national security.And national security policy really is at stake.Yesterday the US reaffirmed that allowing Huawei to build our G network — even parts of it which are deemed to be low- risk — would be “madness” and could compromise the willingness of the US to share vital intelligence with Britain in future.This didn’t come in one of Donald Trump’s notorious am tweets but from officials working for Matt Pottinger, the US deputy national security adviser, and Robert Blair, special representative for international telecommunications policy.That they took the trouble to visit London to warn of the dangers we could be getting ourselves into ought to be seen as a red flag on Huawei’s involvement in our G network.Surely, the importance of being able to share intelligence with our most important ally should rank above pure considerations of cost.Australia has already blocked the Chinese firm from its G network.Yet here, the head of MI Sir Andrew Parker said he had “no reason” to think Britain’s intelligence partnership with the US would sufferinvolvement from the Chinese firm was given the green light.But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace underlined at the weekend that the US administration has threatened to cut off some intelligenceBritain approves Huawei’s involvement in G.He said: “Those things will be taken into account when the Government collectively decides to make a decision on it.”Our own Government — as it has been doing since Theresa May’s day — insists that only parts of the G contract would be awarded to Huawei.It would not be allowed to work on security-critical areas.But that isn’t good enough. Such is the complexity of modern telecommunications networks that it would be impossible to be sure that systems installed in one part of the network were not enabling data to be obtained from another.Whoever designs and builds a telecommunications system gains the power to interfere with it, or even switch it off, should it feel inclined.Of course, with modern communications a huge amount of damage can be done from afar.Evenwe are confident our broadband network is secure now, we can’t be certain that would remain the case.A company which installs a telecommunications network will necessarily continue to be involved in maintaining and upgrading the network it had designed and installed.We have to be absolutely sure the network is not being used for some underhand purpose.Huawei denies that it is controlled by the Chinese state, and has threatened to sue commentators in France whom it alleges have made that claim.But the precise relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state is hardly the point.What is certain is that China is not a democracy and there is always going to be a security issue when it comes to involving its industrial giants in sensitive work here.We would not allow a Chinese company, say, to build fighter jets for the RAF or to construct our radar defence system.This kind of work is rightly the preserve of contractors on whom we can rely totally, even in times of international conflict.Such is the importance of telecommunications in military and civil defence that we now have to think of mobile networks in the same light.The Government has been warning for years that cyber warfare is the big coming threat.In  it published a Strategic Defence Review which defined cyber attack as a “Tier One” threat alongside terrorism.Last November, the US and Taiwanese held a joint exercise in fending off a major cyber attack on Taiwan.At the time the Taiwanese Cyber Security Agency said it was the subject of an astonishing million cyber attacks every month, half of which came from the Chinese mainland.So why, then, is our own Government even considering commissioning a Chinese company to install a telecommunications network Of course, Boris Johnson is right to make it clear he is not Donald Trump’s poodle.We don’t have to take notice of everything the Americans say, on defence, trade or anything .But when it comes to our closest ally warning us that it might not want to share intelligence with us in futurewe let a Chinese company build our G network, we very much do need to take notice.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead it was deeply hurtful, I was so devastated I couldn’t show it to anyone – and I never would have, had it not been for the People magazine piece which meant I had to release portions to defend myself.”Thomas also disputed suggestions he had made no attempts to contact Meghan after the royal wedding, reportedly providing unanswered texts and receipt of an unanswered call to a number he had previously used to reach Harry and Meghan.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It comes despite Chancellor Sajid Javid saying Tory plans for government were the most green manesto any party has ever published.

Whichever it is, his comments fly in the face of the Conservative manesto commitment to tackling the climate emergency. Last month Boris Johnson claimed a far-reaching environment programme would make this nation the cleanest, greenest on Earth. Yet asked , given the climate catastrophe, we should be flying less, Mr Hancock told BBC Radio  Live: Nope. I think connectivity around the country is incredibly important. “Take the flights to the Scilly Isles for instance, it’s very hard and takes a long time to get to the Scilly Islesyou’re not in an aeroplane.” He said he had flown from London to Aberdeen, and askedheaposd do it again he replied: “Yes of course,that’s necessary.

William and Harryaposs statement said: Despite clear denials, a  story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge. For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful. With Harry and Meghan looking to split their time between Britain and North America, it is unclear how much time Archie will actually get with his cousins in the foreseeable future. On their official SussexRoyal Instagram page, the Sussexes said they hoped to raise their little child with aposgeographic balance.The statement went on to say they would raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.Following his birth in May, until he was whisked away to Canada in November, Archie has lived at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor,  miles from Kensington Palace where George, Charlotte and Louis reside. The Sun reports that the Cambridges opted to meet baby Archie for the first time alone, leaving their children at home. It has been said Meghan and little Prince Louis appeared to hit it off during the polo match in July. But with the Sussexes alleged to have been discussing the possibility of quitting public le as early as May last year, they chose to spend Christmas in Vancouver, far away from Sandringham with the other royals, as per tradition.  And just days after arriving back in the UK they announced they would be stepping back from senior royal le with the intention of becoming financially independent. Harry is due to host the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace on Thursday before he is expected to jet back over to his we and child. The duke arrived two hours before the crunch meeting at the Sandringham estate to have a heart-to-heart with the Queen alone.  The -year-old monarch was said to be bitterly disappointed by the Sussexesapos desire to step back from public le while splitting their time between the UK and North America. Following their chat and a discussion with the three princes afterwards, Her Majesty gave her blessing for a transitional period. Her Majesty had been desperate for her grandson and his new we to remain full-time working members of the firm, an official statement said last night, but has now relented. She is said to want the problem resolved in days rather than weeks but has admitted producing a workable plan for the Sussexesapos desired financial independence has proved complex with details still being ironed out. The coupleaposs new website states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £.million.

They put “blood, sweat and tears” into the two-bed dump, bought under a council regeneration scheme. Debbie and Ste were shaken when they first stepped through the door – armed with a £, schedule of works from Liverpool City Council to bring it up to scratch. The th century terraced house had been hit by fire and had crumbling walls, broken bricks and burnt joists. But the couple worked -, did most of the renovations themselves and in  months transformed it into a cosy home for just £,. After enjoying their first Christmas in the double-fronted home in the city’s Wavertree district, the pair have been buoyed by a valuation of £,. Debbie, , says: “We never want to move because we have put so much of ourselves into this house. People thought we were nuts. “We’ve crawled on the floors, we built the floors… it’s a gamble we took and we love it. Our blood and guts have gone into it. If they’d give us next door, we’d do it again!” Recalling the first time she saw the property, Debbie says: “It was just a shell. All the joists were burnt. It was terrible. “Honestly, it was just stacks and stacks of bricks. There was nothing. My family were saying to me, ‘You’re mad’.”  Every floor had to be replaced, chimneys were removed, the sinking kitchen was underpinned, all fittings were ripped out and the windows were upgraded. Debbie and Ste, , used their savings and took a small loan to complete the work – and it was hard graft. We were there until midnight with torches. We went seven days a week, we didn’t miss a day,” Debbie says. She scoured local ads for bargains and bagged a £, kitchen for a tenth of the price and a £, bathroom suite for £,. They also picked up a slightly damaged £, front door for £.  And, slowly but surely, the place came together. Now it is a shining example of how Liverpool is breathing new le into former slums. The council unveiled its Homes For A Pound scheme in . A year later, bosses vowed that , empty houses would be brought back into use. Since then, , homes have been reoccupied – including  in the Webster Triangle, Wavertree, where the Hodges live. Seven more families are due to move in soon. A similar scheme has since been launched in Stoke-on-Trent. Last year, a Channel  documentary about the renovations in Liverpool featured Debbie and Ste.  The couple say the sense of community in the Webster Triangle is a great example of how councils candepressed areas to homely neighbourhoods. The Hodges used to rent in Anfield and had struggled to get a mortgage. Debbie suffered a serious long-term illness and Ste’s wages as a carpet cleaner were not enough to secure a home loan. Debbie says: “The council scheme was the best thing to happen to us. It brings communities together. When we moved in, there were only about three houses in the road occupied. But it’s moving on now, it’s coming to be more of a community and about half the street is filled.  “We’ve met all the neighbours and introduced ourselves. People come from everywhere, dferent areas, dferent countries. It’s a lovely community and I’m really settled here. I just love it. Once a month we clean the street and make it nice. The area is coming up, there are bars and restaurants opening further down the road… I just wouldn’t move. “I can definitely see the area getting better and we’ve never been so happy.” The couple have two daughters – Jade, , a psychologist who has her own home, and -year-old teaching assistant Jenna, who still lives with her parents and is studying for an MSC. Debbie hopes the Homes For A Pound scheme will help young Liverpudlians like Jenna get on the property ladder.

Fair enough, said Harry and Meghan, we will. Cue the eruption. The critics want to have their cake and eat it. As in any dysal situation, they dismiss anything from the Sussexes unless it falls into line with whatever they want. Harry – forced to walk through London behind his mother’s coffin as a -year-old – can’t open up on his mental health issues without being attacked as weak. Meghan can’t breathe without being vilied for showing a lack of consideration to the Queen, the Crown, the flag and the Empire. The Sussexes are not allowed to set their own boundaries. Not when “duty” demands they are there to be pushed around.Of course, race has played a part in it. That much is obvious to large sections of black and white Britain. Yes, Camilla, Diana and Sarah Ferguson were also treated badly, but not like this. Not with the sustained vitriol that Meghan has had to endure. From her son being mocked up as a chimp to criticising her for editing Vogue – even though Prince Harry edited Radio ’s Today programme and Kate edited the Huffington Post website. Social media critics claimed bi-racial Meghan was not pure enough to marry into the Firm. The inference has always been that she doesn’t belong. She has been derided as a a, intent on wrecking the Royal Family. The so-called “constitutional crisis” is Harry and Meghan fighting back.  They are young people who want to go their own way. Millions of families have them. Kids who decide they want no part of the way things have been done in the past, children of rock stars who aren’t interested in music, footballers’ kids who don’t like sport. Frankly, the Sussexes are right to put themselves and their own wellbeing first. Of course, Home Secretary Priti Patel can’t see the problem. She serves under a Prime Minister whose overt racism is well documented. This debate, however, could yet become a turning point for our media. Most of the royal commentators stamping their feet over this are white. Most of the newsrooms covering this are largely white. The real time backlash is from black Britons with a digital  who are determined to have their say.  Angry, polarised race-baiting for social media hits is not the answer. The solution is a better ethnic mix in our media to give us an understanding of how to address this issue. Royal Author Penny Junor was left stumped on CBS This Morning when she vehemently insisted race was not a factor in Meghan’s treatment. “Did you check in with any black Britons before you made that determination ” asked the presenter. Junor was left stuttering. It appeared she hadn’t. All Meghan has done is back her husband as he chooses to move out of his grandmother’s house and fend for himself.

At that he stopped as it must have dawned on him that he had broken the order. aposaposI was distraught, upset and reduced to tears he was starting his campaign against me. I have had to endure years of verbal abuse over the years and I cannot endure anymore threats.  I get a sinking feeling in my stomach whenever I want to take the dogs out for a walk in the morning.  It is one of my favourite times of the day going out for a walk and helps me a lot and it gets me down knowing that he is going to be there. ”My le has been shaken up by the breast cancer and surgery and I feel I can’t go about my le and walking my dog.  I’m begging the courts to help me, protect me from this man who’s venting his anger at me.aposapos Mr Holdich who has lived next door to Nolan for almost  years told the hearing: aposaposCath had just come out of hospital after having a double mastectomy. She hadn’t been out properly and loved walking our dogs.  She wanted to go out and walk the dogs just a little way round the back of the property. aposaposI didn’t walk with her but went so far just to keep an eye on her outside the gate and watched her round the back. But I could see he was yelling at me from his lounge window.  He was behind double glazing but I could tell by his demeanour, he was waving his hands, shouting and  was making reference to a piece of paper in his hand. He was pointing at it and eventually gave me the two fingers. aposaposCath came up and joined me where I was stood, she looked up and said: aposnot again, here we go again.apos With everything  that was going on in our lives at the time it wasn’t something that we needed.  It was really upsetting for both the we and myself.aposapos "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan harry remove line website","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Harry remove line on website claiming theyre entitled to personal securityMeghan and Harry were forced to remove claims from website RoyalSussex that they are entitled to personal bodyguards due to their status, despite opting to quit royal firmShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video summit-sandringham-queen-says-wanted-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-harry-remove-line-website-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle were forced to remove a line from their new website claiming they are internationally protected people entitled to personal security whenever they want. One of the key points of discussion at Mondayaposs crisis summit at Sandringham was the Sussexesapos annual security bill, which is understood to be paid for by the taxpayer. The couple, who fled to Vancouver for a six-week Christmas hiatus, announced last week they intended to give up public le and step down as senior royals. But with Harry, Meghan and little Archie planning to split their time between Britain and North America as they look to become financially independent, it is unclear how their body guards will be paid for. Launched last Wednesday, the rebellious duke and duchessapos new official website Sussexroyal contained the controversial phrasing about their entitlement.But this was deleted in a matter of hours of it going live, reports the Mail Online .The publication said legal expert Dai Davies, a former chief superintendent who led the Metaposs royalty protection unit, said naivety beggars belief.  He said they were mistaken to presume they should have round-the-clock protection when they are no longer senior royals. I have never heard of the phrase aposaposinternationally protected peopleapos, he continued. As far as I can see there is no such thing when you are no longer performing royal duties. The coupleaposs new website states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £.million.  And with their intention to relinquish the Sovereign Grant, it is understood Prince Charles made it clear he does not have unlimited funds. Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, as well as fitting out Frogmore cottage, all cost millions and it is unclear how far the Prince of Wales is willing to bank roll the pair. Any future funding is likely to impose firm rules on their commercial ventures, with the couple expected to look to make millions abroad.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said thereaposs still much to discuss over the Sussexesapos proposed move to Canada. The Sussexesapos desire to move has raised questions over the costs of the coupleaposs security during their time in North America and who would foot the bill. Asked during an interview with Global News on Monday whether Canadian taxpayers would have to pay, Mr Trudeau said: That is part of the reflection that needs to be had and there are discussions going on.  Weaposre not entirely sure what the final decisions will be, what the dispositions are and those are decisions for them. I think most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of costs are involved, there are still lots of discussions to have. He said the federal Canadian government had not been involved up until this point about what the coupleaposs move to the country will involve.  There are still a lot of decisions to be taken by the royal family, by the Sussexes themselves, as to what level of engagement they choose to have, Mr Trudeau said. We are obviously supportive of their reflections but have responsibilities in that as well. The Sussexes enjoyed a general feeling of appreciation in Canada, he added. Meghan was seen in public this week for the first time since the bombshell announcement, as she boarded a seaplane from Vancouver Island.

Prince Charles and Prince William have told the Queen they will take the reins after she brokered a peace deal to allow the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to quit their roles. William on Tuesday carried out ­investitures on behalf of the monarch, including a knighthood for former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will expand their work in climate change and early years development, and the Prince of Wales will join world leaders in Israel and Palestine next week. Round-the-clock discussions continue to find “workable solutions” to allow the Sussexes to split their le between Canada and the UK.Courtiers hope the renewed focus will assist the family and their senior aides to forge new ideas alongside plans being thrashed out to help the couple leave the family set-up. It is understood discussions will determine what role the couple will have with UK charities they have been involved in. The Queen said in her unprecedented statement this week how the issues were “complex matters for my family to resolve”. Despite the -year-old monarch suggesting solutions would be “reached in the coming days”, the Mirror understands “deep concerns” have emerged at ­organisations where the Sussexes hold patronages. Last year they carried out around  engagements but insiders fear grassroots organisations will sufferthey are part-time royals. One senior official at the National Theatre told how there is anger that Meghan visited director Rufus Norris and executive director Lisa Burger in London last Wednesday, hours before the announcement she and Harry would be “stepping back” from royal duties. Meghan “carried on aseverything was completely normal” and gave no indication she would put in jeopardy the patronage given to her by the Queen last January after holding the role for  years. One well-placed source said: “It’s fair to say there is a lot of worry about whether the Duchess will stick around after failing to tell theatre bosses of her intentions, which were published on social media hours after her meeting. “She was seen as the perfect advertisement, she appeals to a cross section of ages and genders and it was hoped she would be a real force for change in the industry. We hope she doesn’t abandon us.” A spokeswoman for the National Theatre said they had held “very positive discussions about the NT’s upcoming activity and opportunities for the Duchess to engage with the work over the coming year”. Harry is royal patron of  organisations while Meghan has four, including the ­Association of Commonwealth Universities, which the Queen held for  years.  The Duchess also took on patronage of animal charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps unemployed women and for which she designed a collection of clothes. Harry and Meghan are understood to have not ed clear verdicts to the royal family on how long they intend to spend in each country. Speculation is mounting they could lose or renounce their royal titles after the Queen referred to them by their first names in her historic statement.

In October, The Duchess of Sussex took legal action against the Mail on Sunday over its decision to publish a highly personal letter which she penned for her dad. But the estranged father and daughter appear to be on a collision course after reports that the newspaper signed up Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle, as its star witness. The Mail on Sunday will argue there is a huge public interest in the personal relationships of members of the royal family as part of its defence, court documents show. The newspaper also says royals rely on publicity about themselves and their lives to maintain the privileged positions they hold. In February, the Mail on Sunday published extracts of Meghanaposs handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle. In one extract, published by the newspaper, the duchess wrote: Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces - not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand. Meghanaposs lawyers filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information. But in its legal defence the paper claims the duchess did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that the contents of the letter were private and would remain so, according to the BBC.  It comes just  hours after the Queen agreed Harry and Meghan could step back as senior royals and begin a new le as an independent family. Buckingham Palace also confirmed the Sussexes would begin a transition period in which they would split their time between the UK and Canada, where the Duchess is currently with their son Archie. Mr Markle was caught up in controversy in the build-up to the  wedding after he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself and then began commenting regularly to entertainment website TMZ about his contact with his daughter.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA neglected seven-year-old boy was found living in a home that resembled a rubbish tip, alongside his drug addict parents. The home was found littered with heroin needles, rotting food and infestations of flies when social services and the police arrived. Leicester Crown Court heard the youngster had vanished off the local authorityaposs radar after moving schools - despite not showing up to school for six months, reports Leicestershire Live. Alexander Wolfson, prosecuting, said there was a multi-agency meeting in December , before the police attended an address in Leicester and found it to be in absolute squalor. He said: The conditions were disgusting, with rotting food and piles of rubbish everywhere. The bedrooms, lounge and bathroom were filthy. The kitchen was rancid with a couple of tins of food left open and evidence of mouse droppings. The stove was inaccessible, there was mouldy food in the fridge and it was dficult to move around. Unfortunately drugs paraphernalia was lying about items associated with taking heroin, with uncapped needles. Cigarette ash was evident and flies. Bags of rubbish were on the upstairs landing. When a drawer in the boyaposs bedroom cupboard was opened a cloud of flies flew into the air, said the prosecutor. He added: There were faeces marks across a wall. The toilet was filthy with no evidence of a toothbrush or toothpaste in the bathroom. The child didnapost appear to have a change of clothes and didnapost have pyjamas. He was not wearing underwear or socks. He did not appear to have toys fit to play with. The boy told officers he had eaten some cookies during the day, but did not appear to have had anything . The foster parents he was placed with reported that he did not want to wash, brush his teeth or have his hair washed and was terried of flies. He was always hungry and had dficulty understanding the dference between day and night. He had not been registered with a GP and needed medication for worms.  The child was placed in school and assessed as being two years behind. However, he did not appear to be malnourished or to have any other medical issues. Mr Wolfsen said the child said he had played on an XBox a lot when living with his parents. He ate bread and butter with ketchup and played with the toaster in his fatheraposs bedroom - and went to bed when he liked. When interviewed, the father said multiple bereavements had left him unable to cope, and he went into a drug-induced downward spiral. The mother accepted the house was in a poor condition saying she only lived there because she had nowhere . Both parents, who are not being named because of a court order protecting the boyaposs identity, pleaded guilty to an offence of child cruelty by neglect. Mr Wolfsen said: Heaposs been doing well in short-term foster care and will be placed into long-term foster care. He has a bright future ahead of him. Heaposs desperate to see his mum and dad and is described as being fiercely loyal to them - and asks about them. They are having supervised contact with him. The distressed mother wept in the dock during the hearing.  Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: This is a dficult sentencing exercise. When it involves an innocent child who has clearly suffered, anyoneaposs instincts would be to mete the harshest penalties on those responsible. One has to look at the facts and the circumstances. He told the parents: The prosecutor tells me youaposve had contact with your son and heaposs expressed a desire to continue contact with you and that he loves you both. Heaposs fiercely loyal to both of you. He obviously now has a bright future and the hardship heaposs suffered is potentially something that can be put behind him. Iaposm dealing with two people who werenapost, by any measure, capable of looking after a child. Iaposve been given details about what led to this awful situation arising. Both of you, historically, have drug problems and thataposs affected the way you live your lives. The court heard that one of the childaposs grandparents had been actively involved in helping to properly care for the boy at a dferent address, but when she died he ended up living where with his parents.  Other deaths in the family led to his father relapsing into former class A drug addiction. The judge said: The photographs of the house speak for themselves. Some of the rooms look like rubbish tips. Heroin needles were around, there was rotten food and flies. A police officer says, in his statement, he retched and almost threw up when he went into the house. Itaposs very fortunate the child has made a full recovery. This wasnapost evil out-and-out cruelty. The parents are themselves incapable and inadequate. There are positive measures now in their lives, in the sense of dealing with their addictions. Philip Gibbs, mitigating for the father, who is in his s, said: The defendant loves his son. Itaposs clear from the photographs he failed in his duty to care for his son.  He says prior to moving there the boy was perfectly looked after. The father, who had been clean of drugs for several years before relapsing, disagreed with some of the prosecution claims, saying the boy was given baths but had an aversion to bathing. He was taken out, he was also fed - as there was evidence of cereal boxes and take-aways. The boy had been taught how to use a kne and fork, it was claimed. He and the childaposs mother accept they struggled to maintain the house, said Mr Gibbs. The father claimed he did not seek help for fear of having his son taken away. Mr Gibbs said: He apologises to his son over and above all . They have supervised contact and the bond remains. The child loves his dad and his mum - itaposs a human tragedy. Itaposs alarming a child can disappear out of the school system for thatof time. The boy went into foster case without any real medical concerns and has thrived.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs third dates go, it couldn’t have been more romantic. Camping out under the stars in Botswana, Prince Harry said he and Meghan Markle fell in love “incredibly quickly” – proof the “stars were aligned”. It was a love story that was soon to capture the nation’s heart. The country believed they were the couple to take the Royal Family into the future, adored by a younger generation. They understood how to communicate in modern ways, without the traditional stuffy nature of The Firm. But there were concerns too. Was Meghan’s LA approach to le just too radical for the royal establishment  Few could have known then that those niggling worries would explode into a crisis just over three years later. A well-placed insider told how staff inside the palace were “apprehensive but willing to see how things panned out” with Meghan’s introduction. But they were dumbfounded within months when the former actress put her own stamp on things. The source said: “There was a lot of excitement about Meghan’s introduction but it’s fair to say there were more than a few murmurings to the contrary. “The feeling was one of concern for Harry more than anything . He’s long craved a quiet le, away from the attention that being a royal brought. “Yet somehow it seemed he had chosen someone who came from the complete opposite of the world he wanted, not to mention someone who would struggle with the boredom of royal le he often bemoaned.” The nation’s chief emotion back in  was relief that he had finally found a woman who could care for him after he had lost his beloved mother so cruelly.  We had wept as we watched a -year-old Harry fighting tears as \u2028he walked behind the coffin of Princess Diana. And we celebrated as the -year-old seemingly found his soulmate. It had not been an easy ride. Ever since his mother’s death, he had hit the headlines – and not always for the right reasons. From wearing a fancy dress Nazi unorm to naked escapades in a Las Vegas hotel, it seemed he was heading down a troubled path. But he appeared to turn his le around when he joined the Army and served in Afghanistan.  “There is no way I am going to put myself through Sandhurst then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country,” he said. But he still struggled to find the right partner. As brother Prince William, settled down with Kate Middleton, Harry bounced from woman to woman. From a fling with model Cassie Sumner in  to \u2028a brief relationship with Love Island presenter Caroline Flack, he seemed to struggle to find a woman who lived up to his mother’s standards. He had an on-off relationship with Chelsy Davy, between  and , when the pair met during his gap year in Cape Town. She was even his date at Prince William and Kate’s wedding.  Harry was linked to singers Mollie King and Ellie Goulding, then dated actress Cressida Bonas from  to . When that ended, due to Cressida being unable to stand the public scrutiny, the country wondered whether he would ever find the perfect woman. “I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,” he said. “So I’m waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.” In the summer of , Harry finally found that woman. It’s believed that he was set up on a blind date with Meghan Markle at a mutual friend’s dinner party.  “I was beautully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her,” said Harry. “I was like, I’m really going to have to up my game here.” Their romance moved at speed. After meeting for drinks following the blind date, they wanted to meet again. She said: “Very quickly into that we said, ‘well, what are we doing tomorrow ’” After just two dates, he asked her to join him in Botswana. “We were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other,” said Harry. As rumours of their relationship emerged, controversy followed. At , the Suits actress was three years older than Harry, orced and mixed race. Her mother Doria Ragland was orced from her dad, Thomas Markle.  But Harry was undeterred, saying he knew immediately that Meghan, was “the one”. And his desire to protect her was evident from the start. Another royal source said: “Harry believed he had struck the jackpot. He found a beautul, impressive, sophisticated woman who had successfully made her own way in the world in her career with a heart of gold to go with it. “She was socially confident and seemed to have all the characteristics to take the pressure away from Harry, who struggled adapting after army le.” After claims Meghan was receiving sexist and racist abuse, Kensington Palace released a statement to say the Prince was “deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her”. It just brought the couple closer, with Meghan often staying at Nottingham Cottage in Kensington Palace.  And on May ,  – the day that would become future son Archie’s birthday – they first appeared in public together. Meghan, from Los Angeles, cheered on her boyfriend at a polo match and the couple were photographed kissing. As their first anniversary approached they ed to Botswana, staying at a wildle habitat and visiting the Victoria Falls. Rumours circulated that a proposal was on the cards, especially when Meghan met the Queen at Balmoral to get her approval. Harry joked it probably helped that the corgis took to Meghan “straight away”. With both families on board, Harry popped the question that November as the couple shared a quiet night in at Nottingham Cottage.  They were apparently cooking roast chicken when the prince got down on one knee. “It was just an amazing surprise,” said Meghan. Harry incorporated two stones from his mother’s jewellery collection, along with a diamond from Botswana, in the engagement ring. The couple began planning their wedding and Meghan started the procedure of becoming a royal. She quit acting, closed her personal social media accounts and learned the etiquette of a future duchess. Another palace insider said: “Meghan made huge sacrices to be with Harry. She gave up her successful acting career, lestyle business, arguably her ability to speak freely on big issues she had been invested in.  “But there was a feeling the opportunity of joining the family, not to mention the love she felt for Harry, would mean those sacrices would be worth it to make the real change in the world that she had talked about. The public had been wowed with his choice of partner –glamorous, mixed race, a successful and impressive young woman who could bring the monarchy up to date. “The Queen has always reminded the family public admiration and acceptance are important for the monarchy’s survival and to not forget that when thinking of outside influences. But it quickly seemed like Harry and Meghan were moving in dferent circles, away from the centuries old tradition.  “A look at their wedding guests should have been a sign, such as when former confidants or lelong friends were replaced by global superstars \u2028like Elton John and Oprah Winfrey – two people who have become highly influential in the couple’s lives.” On May , , Prince Harry stood at the altar of St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. As Meghan walked down the aisle beside Prince Charles, due to the absence of her own father, Harry could not take his eyes off her. As she reached his side, he whispered: “You look amazing.” And she did.

The Queen informally referred to the pair as Harry and Meghan in a statement this week, a highly unusual break from protocol which prompted speculation they could be forced to give up their royal titles. But signs of the coupleaposs departure may have been there all along and show they have a wider masterplan for their new lives, royal expert Joe Little claims. Baby Archie is entitled to be known as The Earl of Dumbarton, owing to his lofty status as the first-born son of HRH Prince Harry. However, Harry and Meghan have decided not to use the name and instead decided he would be styled as Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in accordance with their wished that he be raised as a private citizen. Last weekaposs announcement now has some keen observers wonderingthey were in fact planning to leave the family for some time. Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine, said : The fact Archie isnapost Earl of Dumbarton or styled HRH makes me wonder whether this wasnapost already part of a wider masterplan.The Earl of Dumbarton is a secondary title that was created for Harry on his wedding by the Queen and refers to the Dumbarton in the area West Dunbartonshire, Scotland.Prince Harry may have even offered a clue he wanted out of the spotlight as a young boy , according to an anecdote by his former protection officer. Ken Wharfe recalled how he overheard four-year-old Prince Harry telling his brother he could could do what he wanted because he would never be king. Wharfe recalled the fascinating incident which happened as the family were travelling from London to Gloucester during a weekend over thirty years ago.According to Wharfe, Prince Harry and his brother William became locked in an argument as they drove to their destination.

Butthere was ever any doubt who remains in charge, those thoughts were laid to rest in one of the most extraordinary days in modern royal history. With a masterful stroke of leadership, the Queen took back control of a situation that had in recent times threatened the fabric of the institution. In her amazing statement, she mentions family eight times. The message is clear: We are united and we will survive.  When a star player causes problems for the rest of the team, any boss worth their mettle will not hesitate to take action. No matter what, no one is bigger than the club. And in this case, that club - revered around the world for its handling of its triumphs as well as its misfortunes - is the monarchy , which the Queen has served so dutully during her  years so far on the throne.

Waves crashing against a sea wall just metres from a commuter train in Dawlish, Devon, made for a risky-looking journey as mph gusts roared in. Rail passengers suffered delays and temporary speed limits were imposed due to the heavy winds and fallen trees, while drivers were advised to take extra care on the roads.

Seth Van Beek received his licence after completing  months training and clocked up  hours in the air before he passed with flying colours. He always dreamed of becoming a pilot since the age of eight so his mum Frances, , decided to sell their three-bed home to fund his dream. Seth, from Preston, London, is now the UKaposs youngest licensed commercial pilot, a record previously held by Luke Elsworth, who passed when he was . He had to move to Greece for the intensive £, flight school course and is now on the hunt for a job. Seth said: Flying has always been my dream. There was nothing  that I had ever wanted to do, and there is nothing I would contemplate doing. You donapost have a single epiphany where you realise that you want to be something or do something, it comes from experience. My mum was an avid traveller when she was younger, and when I was a boy sheaposd take us on holidays to see the world. I loved everything about flying - even the fact that a -tonne tube of metal can basically be shot up into the air and fly for up to  hours. As I grew up, my love became a passion, and Iaposm so grateful that the experience of training didnapost discourage me, like training can. If anything, I knew there and then this would be what I did for my whole le. To be honest, I took very naturally to flying - thereaposs no feeling like it. When you are flying manually, you are in charge. Itaposs a big responsibility, but itaposs exhilarating, and that means flyingaposs an honour.  And Iaposve always felt safer flying in a plane, or flying one, than travelling on a bus or driving a car - though I do have a driveraposs licence! People have to chase their dreams, and Iaposve been so lucky, being able to make my dream my career because of my mum. None of this would have been possible without her - I love her to pieces! Seth left school in Zimbabwe after his GCSEs and attended Egnatia Aviation Training College after passing gruelling entrance exams in January , aged . In April , having turned  on March , he then began  monthsapos training at the prestigious Mediterranean flight academy.Though he could have trained in the UK, Seth said he chose to learn in Greece so he could break the world record - and because the weather was better.Seth had to sit  exams, alternating between learning theory and practical flying at Kavala International Airport every three months. He then flew up to five times-a-week during his practical stints, initially for just  minutes, but eventually flying for five hours over Greece. Seth also completed three theory-based courses - the ATP Integration Course, Jet Orientation, and Multi Crew Cooperation His total theory study time totalled  hours, often revising late into the night. Sethaposs average exam score was .% and he graduated in September at the top of his class, getting his licence from the European Aviation Safety Agency a month later. He said: Everything just made sense to me. I became known around the school for being a hard worker and people asking for advice. They were asking me - aposhow would I prepare for this or that apos. But I would study extra outside of class, just to make sure that I had perfected my knowledge - I had top marks in sight. During exam season, Iaposd finish class at pm, and then work until around  or am the next day, right through.  Seth said he was inspired by his mother Frances, who had always supported my dreams and told me that I could make itI worked hard. Frances, who also has a -year-old daughter, sold their home in Milton Keynes and downsized to a flat, to free up £, for Sethaposs course, plus accommodation fees. He added: She made huge sacrices for me, and I couldnapost let her down. I had to achieve, and to succeed. I wanted to be top of my class, so that I could show her that it was worth everything. The hours of study, the stress - and her decision to sell the house so that she could set money aside to one day finance my training. And sheaposs well and truly proud! His mum Frances, originally from Zimbabwe, said: When I start to think about everything, I get so overwhelmed.

A second low-pressure front brought further strong gales to much of the country on Tuesday, causing the roof of an apartment block to crash into Slough High Street in Berkshire.  Gusts in the area were in excess of mph at the time of the incident, according to the Met Office .An enormous chunk of a roof was torn off of the block of flats housing  people. Shocking footage shows the roof of the building in ruins, with debris and bags being blown around the street. People can be seen trying to salvage shop signs and awnings that were narrowly missed by the huge structure.  In west London, part of a roof collapsed on tube line tracks at Ravenscourt Park during the high winds.A commuter told the Express Online the roof sparked and smoked as it collapsed.As a result there were severe delays on the Piccadilly and District lines.  In Cornwall, the small village of Malpas, which boasts of some of the best river views has been cut off from the rest of the world after a large tree came down in gale force winds. Chris Barker, the Royal Mail postie, said: It is annoying. I only had about  minutes left on my sht and now I’m stranded here. I guess I’ll have to take refuge in the pub. Itaposs the only road in and out and itaposs blocked. They are going to have to come quickly because no emergency vehicle could get through. The village is completely blocked off.  A yellow warning of wind covering much of England is due to expire at am on Wednesday, while a rain warning covering south-east England is scheduled to cease at am. Meteorologist Alex Burkill, from the Met Office, said: It will take a little while but the rain should clear by lunchtime. Once it does clear away, otherwise tomorrow, most places are in for some decent sunny spells. There could be further thundery showers mainly to the north and west of the UK, with the chance of sleet and snow across the hills and mountains of Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the forecaster.  Some  flood warnings and  flood alerts were issued by the Environment Agency on Tuesday, as coastal areas struggled with strong gusts, high tides and large waves. Rail passengers faced delays and temporary speed limits due to the heavy winds and fallen trees, while drivers were advised to take extra care on the roads. Although the wind is due to ease off on Wednesday, conditions will still be blustery, Mr Burkill said, and temperatures are due to dip slightly to  degrees. But he warned that more unsettled weather was ahead on Thursday, particularly during the second half of the day, when places across the country could expect wet and windy weather. It doesnapost look as bad as what weaposve had through the past couple of days, he added. At the moment it looks like weaposll stay warning free .

defeat at Ibrox.And the Hibees believe Mackie’s move to Dens Park is the perfect place for him to pick up some much-needed experience before heading back and, hopefully, pushing for a first-team spot.Matches like December’s derby at Tannadice, where Mackie put in arguably his best appearance for the Dark Blues, are exactly the sort of pressure matches the Easter Road side want to see him tested in.“We’ve spoken to Hibs and they are happy he is getting games, decent ones,” added James.“From their point of view, he is getting games in an environment where it’s similar to Hibs.“There are two teams in the one city, big rivalry, playing in derbies live on TV and they need their players to face those things to play for them.“Both clubs are happy and Sean will be here until the end of the season.”Though, they had a break this weekend after the home match with Ayr was called off due to a waterlogged pitch, the Dens boss is keen to see his side bounce back from the disappointing defeat to Inverness  days ago in what is an important part of the season, starting this coming weekend at home to Motherwell in the Scottish Cup.He added: “We’ve a big cup game coming this weekend and it is a big period in the season.“We know where we want to be in the league, we want to be higher than where we are and we are disappointed in our consistency.“We can’t really put a run together, the four games before the Inverness match isn’t really a run for me.“We need to be better all around the pitch than in the Inverness one.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"radio 1s big weekend could return to dundee who would you like to see appear","story":"Radio ’s Big Weekend looks set toto Dundee in May,  years after the event came to the city.Camperdown Park has again been chosen as the preferred venue for the three-day event, having been the location for the three days of music in , and also the site of the Carnival  event in .As reported by The Courier, the venue was given the green light by councillors in a secret meeting on Monday night, where they agreed to bring the event to the city on May -, however the BBC is yet to officially confirm the plans are in place.\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed CIGqEdydZE featureoembed#enablejsapi#originhttps:wpcluster.dctdigital\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenTele columnist Martel Maxwell previously voiced support in bringing the event back to Dundee after the success of the  festival.She said: #It’s quite a location, with acres of land and yet relatively central – as opposed to some festival sites in the back of beyond.#I remember that  two-day event well, when , fans descended on the park to see some of the best music acts from across the world, including The Fratellis, Corrine Bailey Ray and Razorlight.#There was a VIP enclosure and, as I was working as a showbiz reporter, I managed to bag tickets for my entire family.#Mixing home with work was surreal.#As I interviewed Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie, I saw my sister Holly – just  at the time – pose for a photo with Crazysinger CeeLo Green, while Lorraine Kelly was mobbed by fans.#Then, after all that, I continued the party at Fat Sam’s and the then London Club.

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

and other unmarked areas of the car park which were not designated bays.It was, the council said, a way to illustrate the need for additional car parking in Haddington.Now the council has confirmed it is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens employed by the council, for ignoring new yellow lines in their own car park.The long-stay car park in Haddington is on land owned by East Lothian Council and accessed through the adjoining short-stay car park attached to the neighbouring Tesco supermarket."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-electric-bridge-closure","story":"The Electric Bridge in Musselburgh was built to carry traffic

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Paramedics stretcher Homer into an ambulance.It drives off, crashes into a tree, the back doors swing open and Homer rolls out on his stretcher and falls back down the mountain.Thatrsquos Scottish Labour. The party is incapable of putting a foot right. In fact, when it tries to put a foot right, its giant clown shoes step on a rake that hits it in the face.Labour has been in chaos since it got thumped senseless by voters at the General Election. The shenanigans over what to do about independence have been a popcorn-gobbling sight to behold.Some members want a second referendum, some donrsquot. Some like federalism, some donrsquot.Some think independence is inevitable, some would rather get all Johnsonian and die in a ditch than yield to the evil Nats.In an attempt to sort this absolute parody of a sham of a farce out, leader Richard Leonard planned a special conference on the constitution, to consider whether the party should back Indyref, with federalism maybe a third option on the ballot.That sounded a good idea. Have a debate, settle on a position ndash stick to it. Voters like that kind of thing. But no, thatrsquos way too easy for Labour. Too painless. Better to collectively clamber naked into a bag of razor blades and jump around.The partyrsquos Scottish Executive Committee rejected Leonardrsquos idea. Instead, the party will now have an ldquoaway day to discuss the constitution. An ldquoaway day. Are we in a Carry On film  Carry on Incompetent  The headlines were inevitable. It was ldquoutterly humiliating. A ldquocomplete mess.Scottish Labour is disintegrating before our eyes. This is the partyrsquos twilight.Labour cannot cope with the constitutional demands of the st century. Brexit and Scottish independence are killing it.The problem with Labour is Labour. The party of today is in love with the idea of itself, with the history of the party. Itrsquos astherersquos a shrine to Keir Hardiersquos flat-cap where all members must genuflect. The only problem is: the public couldnrsquot care less about Labour traditions and purity. Things changed years ago, Labour just hasnrsquot caught up.It all seems funny, but in truth itrsquos tragic. Scotland needs a ing Labour Party ndash any democracy needs a strong voice from the left. The SNP dresses in progressive clothes, but itrsquos really just been stealing for years now from what was once Labourrsquos wardrobe. Scottish democracy would be much more robustthere were an authentic left-wing party standing up for ordinary people. So what are Labourrsquos options  You can game the strategies ndash but none of them look good for Labour.First, the party can stick with the position it has on the constitution. The problem is, though, that most of the public will say, ldquowhat is that position . One minute Labour seems to be moving towards support for Indyref, or devo max, and the next itrsquos walking everything backwards.Also, voters kicked Labour so hard in the head on its present position at the election that the party is now effectively wearing its face upside down. Labour lost six out of seven MPs and came third behind the Tories on . per cent of the vote.What about federalism or devo max  This is such a sad debate for Labour to have ndash because itrsquos pointless and it will not save them, yet many in the party seem to think of federalism as the leboat which will carry them to safety.Before Brexit, some form of federalism may have been an option, but not now. Surely even Labour can see that  How will federalism appeal to voters who care about the EU  It will not retain their EU citizenship. It wonrsquot appeal to Yes voters, as they want independence. Federalism wonrsquot appeal to Remain voters as they want back in the EU.Federalism is an escape tunnel with an armed guard waiting at the end of it.Nor will the mechanics of federalism work. In a federal UK all voices would need to be equal ndash thatrsquos the point. However, England has a population of  million, Scotland . million.Unless federalism involves England being balkanised into a series of regions ndash Yorkshire, Cornwall, the Midlands ndash with roughly equivalent populations, it will be entirely undemocratic and unfair. Why would England agree to that  No-onersquos even asked the English.So, should Labour adopt a neutral position on independence  Drop opposition to it, but donrsquot campaign as a party for it ndash allow members a free vote on independence. It sounds nice, but we need only remember the partyrsquos position on Brexit at the election.Trying to play both sides may sound super-smart and slippery, but the electorate doesnrsquot buy it.What about going full ultra-unionist  Well, Labour tried that in  and that was the start of its terminal decline. Former Deputy Leader Alex Rowley, also constitution spokesman, tweeted that too many Labour apparatchiks still feel Better Together and ldquostanding alongside the Tories is the best way forward. If a voter wants unionism, theyrsquove got the Conservatives.Whatrsquos left  The remaining option is to back independence. Every other path is closed off. Could it work  Could the party reconfigure itself, setting out a leftwing case for independence ndash taking the nationalism out of the Yes movement  Might that bring back progressives who left Labour for the SNP  Therersquos plenty of such voters out there who arenrsquot natural SNP supporters.Some Labour figures see the writing on the wall. Ben Bradshaw MP, who was in government with Blair and Brown, says hersquos ldquo% certain Scotland will become independent.MSP Monica Lennon thinks the Scottish party should split from the UK party. The idea is hard to fault.Of course, backing independence could immediately cause Labour to implode. Members might flee, senior figures quit. Would voters be drawn from the SNP to Labour  Itrsquos unlikely.

Stephen sat with a full set of teeth on display, his smile was stretched broad.On the other side, Jonathans mouth was in an appalled downward twist, his head occasionally in his hands.Finally, I have seen Cats, and friends... I loved it.In general, I believe musicals to be artistic atrocities. Singing, I like. Acting, I like. Singing and acting combined  No, thank you anyway.So I had no impetus to go and see Cats the film. I have, full disclosure, seen Cats on the stage and it was tolerable because the characters sang and danced and barely talked so it wasnt a musical of the traditional, \"Im inappropriately bursting in to song instead of finishing this sentence,\" iety.The only thing that drew me to Cats the movie was the promise of two hours of atrocious film making.Im a member of a Bad Movie Club and we thrive on this stuff. The Room. Sharktopus. Its follow up Sharktopus vs Whalewolf. Would Cats be more gloriously awful than Birdemic, the best worst movie ever \"Nearly as obscene as The Human Centipede,\" ran the . \"A monstrosity.\" \"A descent into madness\". One magazine claimed its reviewers had lost all nine of their lives, another tirade said the film was \"straight out of the litter box\".The most tantalising headline simply ran, Cats: Spay It.I was there for it. A motion picture horror piece with the added trauma of James Corden. What could be gloriously worse Well, much, it turned out. Off we went, actors in fur CGI creeping and crawling through the streets of London, their digitally enhanced ears twitching as they moved through the Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats.Nothing grating so far.This, in fact, was a delight. Even the dancing cockroaches had a certain charm. Yes, at points seeing Judi Dench with a lionesque ring of long fur framing her face felt a little fever-dreamish but she pulled it off with a certain twinkling gravitas.What are the complaints  Viewers twisted their knickers over scale - in some parts the cats are as big as cutlery in other parts they fill window frames.Two women in my screening couldnt move past the fact that Jennyanydots unzips her own skin to reveal a new outfit underneath. Others have been upset that Old Deuteronomy wears a fur coat... on top of her own coat of fur.Yet more whiny babies emphasised distress that the cats had fingers. Yes, it certainly would lt the whole film to make the singing, dancing, talking cats more realistic.Bizarrely, no one seemed bothered by Bombalurinas high heels or Taylor Swts horric faux-British accent. These were the only downsides.Lack of a plot has been another incoherent grumble  Too much plot would be a more sensible complaint. Cats is a back-to-back collection of little stand alone stories. It heaves with plots, drips with them.The inidual stories of the cats are marvellous. The Rum Tum Tugger is everycat, recognisable to anyone whos ever lived in service to a cat: \"When you let me in I want to go out.\"Skimbleshanks is missing and the night train cant go without him. Oh here he is! And what a brilliant picture is painted of the sleeper service in that three and a half minutes.Mungojerry and Rumpleteasers song is all charm and humour, a colourful vignette.But looking at it for story is nitpicky nonsense in any case its a two hour  for song and dance.And look at the lyrics. But looking at it for story is nitpicky nonsense in any case itrsquos a two hour  for song and dance.And look at the lyrics. ldquoPractical cats, dramatical cats, pragmatical cats, fanatical cats, oratorical cats, delphic-oracle cats, skeptical cats, dyspeptical cats.\"How about: \"In the light of the door which opens on her like a grin, you can see the corner of her eye twists like a crooked pin\".

He suggested two possible ones Ms Sturgeon might consider.Firstly, to get Holyrood to organise its own ldquolegal referendum and seeWestminster were to challenge it in the courts which would undoubtedly be the case.Secondly, to turn next yearrsquos Scottish parliamentary election into a straight vote on Scotlandrsquos future and thatthe SNP gained a majority of MSPs, then this would result in the nation becoming independent.Mr MacNeil argued thatit was good enough for Mr Johnson to take Britain out of the EU on a vote share of  per cent and a majority of Westminster seats at the December General Election, then the same democratic rule should apply to Scotland and thatthe SNP secured a majority of Holyrood seats in , this would be regarded as the Scottish people voting for independence.ldquoThe great thing about what Boris has done is that it has provided movement I thought he would have kept Scotland dangling for a good year. But he has moved the independence process on. We now have to do something to keep things moving, insisted the Western Isles MP.Earlier, the PM rejected Ms Sturgeonrsquos call for a second independence referendum, saying to hold another vote on Scotlandrsquos future would ldquocontinue the political stagnation of the last decade.In a letter, replying to the one the FM sent before Christmas, Mr Johnson told her: ldquoThe UK Government will continue to uphold the democratic decision of the Scottish people and the promise that you made to them. For that reason I cannot agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums.\"The Tory leader raised his response at the weekly Cabinet, which, his spokesman pointed out, had offered its \"full support\" for his decision to refuse Ms Sturgeons request, noting how it had been taken in ldquoclose consultation with Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary.ldquoThe PM said: lsquoThis Government has an optimistic vision for Scotland and our whole country in , investing in levelling up in every part of the UK.\"rsquoWe do not want the s in Scotland to repeat the previous SNPs lost decade when Scottish schools, hospitals and jobs were left behind because of their campaign to separate the United Kingdom,rsquo\" said the spokesman.But Ms Sturgeon insisted Mr Johnsonrsquos decision had shown ldquoutter contempt for the votes, views and interests of the people of Scotland and was a strategy that was ldquodoomed to failure.She claimed the longer the ldquoWestminster Union tried to block a referendum, the more support for independence would grow.ldquoThe Westminster Union cannot be sustained without consent. Democracy will prevail. The only question is how long it will take the Tories and the rest of the Westminster Establishment to accept that inevitability, added the FM."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10897718.jpg?type=article-full","title":"mail-sunday-uses-public-interest-defence-publication-meghan-legal-claim","story":"The paper has published its defence after the Duchess of Sussex decided to sue the newspaper and its parent group for publishing the handwritten letter she wrote to her estranged father Thomas Markle in .Her claims include misuse of her private information, selective editing of the letter and breach of .The Mail on Sunday rejects all claims.Her decision came in October as Prince Harry launched an extraordinary and highly personal attack on the British tabloid press and its treatment of his we, saying he could no longer be a ldquosilent witness to her private suffering.:Queen supportive of new le for Harry and Meghan ...Emphasising his respect for the importance of ldquoobjective, truthful reporting, he accused parts of the media of ldquowaging campaigns against iniduals with no thought to the consequences and compared the treatment of Meghan to coverage of his mother, Princess Diana.The Mail on Sunday has argued in a court document that members of the Royal Family, including Meghan, \"rely on publicity about themselves and their lives in order to maintain the privileged positions they hold and promote themselves\".It said the duchess \"did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that the contents of the letter were private and would remain so\".In the -page legal filing the paper says the letter was not a protected \"original literary work\" but a recounting of existing facts.While the duchess claimed it infringed her data rights, the newspaper says the data was not sensitive and concerned topics she had put in the public domain And it said extracts it released accurately conveyed the tone, content and meaning of the letter.\"There is a huge and legitimate public interest in the Royal Family and the activities, conduct and standards of behaviour of its members,\" the paper said.\"This extends not merely to their public conduct, but to their personal and family relationships because those are integral to the proper ing of the monarchy.\"As evidence that it did not infringe her privacy, the paper says the letter was \"immaculately copied\" in the duchesss \"elaborate handwriting\", arguing that this care in its presentation meant she anticipated it would be seen and read by a wider audience.The move came after Harry and Meghan announced that they want to \"step back\" from being full-time working royals.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities. A medical school located within the Highlands and Islands has the potential to attract larger numbers of doctors to study here and then, when they’re qualied, to encourage them to stay and work in our region.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families. I would encourage anyone affected by MS to contact them and find out how they can benefit from their invaluable services and support.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And they still do.So I agree with Alison Evison, the president of our councils’ umbrella body Cosla, when she said this week that we are talking of “the sphere of government closest to Scotland’s citizens”.And of course, her comments about local government’s importance come not in the abstract, but as context to a stern real-world warning. Ahead of the Scottish Government’s budget, she noted that “whichever way you want to dress it up, the reality is that in recent budgets the Scottish Government has chosen to overlook the essential services that communities rely on day in, day out”.: SNP plans mean ‘more austerity than under the Tories’, says IFS: Brexit means Scotland now ‘likely’ to vote for independence, says Labour MPIt’s not just her view – or mine. Fteen months ago, the Accounts Commission concluded that “funding for local government from the Scottish Government decreased at a faster rate, . per cent, than the Scottish Government revenue budget at . per cent”. In other words, for all their attempts to blame the Tories – who it is true have decimated local government in England – for the failed experiment of austerity, SNP ministers in Edinburgh have quadrupled the cuts that were handed down to them.Passing the buckBut how could any Scottish government get away with this  From schools to home care, from libraries to bin collections – with the possible exception of the NHS, this is where most of Scotland’s people interact with government and the public sector. Councils and councillors are also citizens’ first port of call when things go wrong – from the heating in rented flats to elderly relatives left in the lurch without a care plan. Surely it would be politically toxic to take the axe to council budgets in exactly the way the SNP has done Unfortunately, ministers have cynically deployed the very fact that local government is closer to Scotland’s citizens in order to shirk responsibility. So when I challenged Nicola Sturgeon over failing care services in South Lanarkshire at First Minister’s Questions last week, she was happy to pass the buck to the SNP-controlled council. And by proxy, she passed the buck to ordinary citizens, who will feel a closer affinity to councils and the services they provide than they do to national governments. While many people consider there to be a direct link between the council tax levied on their homes and the services which they receive, council tax accounted for only £. billion of local government revenue in -. Non-domestic rates accounted for £. billion, but the majority – £. billion – came from the General Revenue Fund allocated by the Scottish Government.And there have been consequences as a result of the SNP Government’s approach.Rising demand for servicesIn , Scotland’s councils held assets valued at £. billion. But rather than a reassurance, we should take this as a warning. These possessions range from single-occupancy flats, to pension fund investments, to architectural gems held in trust for the public they were built to serve. They are each attached to signicant costs or debts. And as councils struggle with rising demand for services such as home care, alongside falling budgets, the cost demand of servicing these assets and the potential sale revenues will make it more and more alluring for councils to be tempted to dispose of them.It is often cultural services which suffer first:  public libraries closed their doors altogether in Scotland in  alone. Many others have seen their hours cut. We are now reaching the point, however, that even statutory services like home care find themselves truly at breaking point. In the past three years,  of Scotland’s  councils have been forced to draw down from their reserves. As a result, councils now hold £ million less in reserves than they did just a year ago.Central Government ministers have set targets and commitments for local government, which could be an effective means of improving services. But without giving councils the financial resources they need to meet these, it becomes simply an effective means of shting the blame for austerity.Devolution of powerSo ahead of the Scottish budget on March , Scottish Labour is calling on the SNP Government to ditch the easy blame games and take some responsibility. Just because there is greater local accountability for local government services, it doesn’t mean central Government can abdicate responsibility for a deliberate choice to underfund them.But we won’t stop there. Over a decade after the SNP promised to abolish the council tax, local government increasingly finds itself under central control: including over the setting of council tax. That’s why I want the principle of subsidiarity – the devolution of power as close as possible to the grass roots – to form part of Scottish Labour’s offer on constitutional reform. A particular challenge is now facing us. With the onset of Brexit, the powers which currently lie with the European Union will be repatriated. The question is where to. They cannot be concentrated in Westminster and Whitehall. They must be devolved. But the strengthening of local government must be part of that.Local government, unfashionable a cause as it may be, will be the bedrock of a more democratic future for Scotland. It should be about bread but it should be about roses as well: theatres and swimming pools as well as roads and bin collections. It is a means to establishing a better, more empowered and more enriched quality of le for our citizens.It is critical to inspiring renewed confidence and rekindled hope in every community across Scotland.But that can’t be done on the cheap. So let’s remind the Scottish Government that now is the time for fair funding for Scotland’s local council services.Richard Leonard is Scottish Labour leader and an MSP for Central Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted green man for one of scotland s most unusual jobs","story":"It must be a contender for one of Scotland#s most unusual job descriptions # but will see the successful applicant get a starring role in one of the country#s most spectacular events.Organisers of the annual Beltane Fire Festival in Edinburgh have launched an extensive recruitment drive for a new “Green Man,” one of the key performers in the event, which traditionally heralds the arrival of summer in the city.This year is understood to be the first time that the role – which is now open to applicants of any gender – has been advertised on social media.The festival wants to shake up the image of the character after more than  years of the event, which sees the Green Man and the May Queen lead a cavalcade of colourful characters around the hill before uniting for a dramatic performance together.: Is the ‘Green Man’ the most important job in the world  – leader commentThey have suggested there have been problems getting people to come forward for because “they feel they don’t fit the profile based on who they’ve seen take the role in the past”. The role description on the Beltane Fire Society website states this has becomes “a self-fulfilling prophecy, as we can only select from those who step forward or are nominated”. It is also being made clear that the role cannot be “completely defined” by the society as “each Green Man has their own journey”, however a key element of the show – which around  people flock to on the last night of April each year – is the death and rebirth of the character.The role description states: “The Beltane Fire Festival is a living, dynamic reinterpretation and modernisation of an ancient Iron Age Celtic ritual, and is the largest of its kind. “Having been resurrected as a performance art piece and practice in , it has become a central focus for our community, bringing people together to acknowledge and celebrate the birth of summer and the fertility of the land.“The purpose of our festival is not to recreate ancient practices, but to honour the spirit of how it might have felt to attend a past celebration and to create our own connections to the cycles of nature. There is a great deal of joy and the revelry fostered in the ritual: it is about casting off the darkness and celebrating the light. A time for celebrating fertility, both in the context of our biology as well as our creative energies.”Potential applicants are warned that there is a rigorous selection process for the role, including inidual interviews, a training day and an open meeting of Beltane Fire Society members.They are being told that they will have to be involved in “actively creating” the festival’s main storyline, working closely with the May Queen, Katie O’Neill, who is playing the goddess figure for a third time.The advert also states: “Beltane celebrates the turning of the wheel of the year, from spring into the beginning of summer: we celebrate each step of the cycle with the festivities.Some aspects change from year to year, but certain elements are fixed and are repeated – one of these is the Green Man and his journey. In the context of the Beltane Fire Festival, the Green Man grows and reaches the height of his power during Beltane.”A spokeswoman for the fire society said the role of the Green Man had been opened to non-members of the group who have had no previous involvement with the event.She added: “People outside our community are very welcome to apply to be the Green Man and we have a flexible approach to gender for the Green Man role.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dumbarton residents say harry and meghan should keep scottish title to boost town","story":"The stepping back from royal duties of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who also hold the title Earl and Countess of Dumbarton, is a #lost opportunity#, say some of its residents.Harry and Meghan were given the Scottish title as a wedding gt from the Queen last May at the time of their marriage.However, despite initial excitement the couple might visit the town and boost its profile, this has not happened.But many believe the pair should retain the title because of publicity it may still generate for the town.Helen MacKenzie, owner of Scruples cafe in Wallace Street, said: “If taking the title away cost a penny to the public purse I’d be against it, but otherwise I’m not bothered.

This will allow local authorities to make valuable local connections across services and focus on early intervention and prevention.”Sally Ann Kelly, chief executive of Aberlour, the children’s charity, wants the Scottish Government to provide transitional funding for early intervention. “Vital grassroots services such as family support and youth work have seen very signicant cuts, yet we know they provide a leline for many of our most vulnerable citizens,” she said.“Aberlour is calling on the Scottish Government to provide a transitional fund supporting local authorities to deliver early intervention family support services, as well as continue to provide specialist support for children and families most affected by poverty and inequality.”Annie Gunner Logan, chief executive of the Coalition of Care and Support Providers, said the number of children living in poverty was continuing to rise. “Such disadvantage causes mental health issues, poor educational attainment, instability at home and dficulty in earning enough to break the cycle,” she said.“Yet it is not inevitable. With the right action and bold investment this can be turned around.”Ms Gunner Logan added: “We call for the lived experience of children and families in poverty to be at the heart of the review and for vision and ambition to be backed up by adequate funding.”Last year, the Scottish Government published its first Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan, which outlined a range of actions aimed at meeting child poverty targets.

Air passenger services already make a loss at the airport but it would have taken only a small number of additional flights to change that.“Instead, this decision is likely to increase the losses from passenger flights and raises once again their viability.A Ryanair spokesperson said: “As announced in December, due to the late delivery of the Boeing Max aircraft, a number of Ryanair bases will be cut or closed in summer . In Scotland, our Prestwick base will be reduced by one aircraft from April.“We are working closely with pilot and cabin crew unions to minimise the impact on staff across Europe.”A spokesperson for Prestwick Airport said: “Reductions to Ryanair’s flying schedules are widely anticipated across its UK bases owing to the much-publicised delayed deliveries of Boeing’s aircraft.“We are meeting with Ryanair later this month to discuss additional capacity for the winter   and summer  timetables.“We continue to enjoy a strong relationship with Ryanair, including acting as a hub for engineering and maintenance crew.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"strike action looms at sullom voe ","story":"Industrial action could soon be on the cards at Sullom Voe Terminal after union Unite announced it will ballot its members.This follows talks with EnQuest on terms and conditions, including pensions.In a consultative ballot held over the festive period,  per cent of Unite members voted to reject EnQuest’s proposed changes to terms and conditions on a  per cent turnout.Unite launched the ballot to coincide with the end of a y internal dispute process involving the union and the company, which has produced no agreement.John Clark, Unite regional industrial officer, said: #Unite will now move forward with an industrial action ballot at Sullom Voe which we have received a resounding mandate for from our membership.

Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service.

With the favourable weather it was a great day for the number of new first-time swimmers and in particular the young people taking part along with the usual stalwarts.With everyone back on terra firma and changed they made their way to the Bridge Inn to get fed and watered prior to the social festivities taking place. Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past. Last year the swim raised the magnicent sum of pound and this year again has got off to a brilliant start with pound being lted on the day thanks to the generous sponsorship from the general public.

The Choir Challenge followed with the ladies out to regain their crown which they had lost last year. They went first conducted by Dana Kernohan setting a very high standard for the judge Billy McIlroy. The men followed and put on a wonderful performance under the leadership of Bert Kernohan.In judging Billy said he had to apply the “Var” as used in football and on this the better harmonising by the ladies gave them the win by the slimmest of margins which was received with rapturous applause.Next year will be the th anniversary of the event which will be a Major Milestone in its history.The Chairman thanked everyone who in any way assisted in helping to make the event the success that it was.The swim took place under the watchful eye of Larne Branch St Johns Ambulance, East Antrim R.N.L.I., Kayakers Jim Mulvenna, Marion O’Dornan and her sister Claire Corr.

Established in January , the six week project has witnessed a record  participants sign up for this year’s programme. Those taking part are teamed with fellow Slimmers in a bid to be crowned overall Saints  Slimmers Champions, .With health and well-being at its heart, Saints  Slimmers provides opportunities for regular team exercise, promotion of positive mental health, development of teamwork skills, dance and many social activities. Participants have been assigned to a team and are following a six week programme of activity. Those involved will be spin cycling in the early morning before winding down with a brisk walk that evening.Circuit training, aerobic workouts and the all important team challenges will keep everyone entertained, while the finale dance-off in the splendour of the Tullyglass House Hotel will provide a fitting celebration of the participants efforts.But don’t let the “Slimmers” reference mislead you. This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative. This years programme sees participants range in age from  to  years of age and activities are tailored to inidual need and fitness.Charity features as an integral part of the programme and last year the organisers at All Saints designated the McMillan Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as the beneficiaries of their efforts. A sum of over poundk was raised principally through the team “Spinathon” at the Harmony Hub in the centre of Ballymena in February. This year a similar event on Saturday, February  will raise funds to benefit the Children’s Hospice.The club would like to thank those local sponsors who have supported inidual teams and events. They include Ballymena Running  Athletic Club, McKillop’s Spar Frys Road, Connolly’s Spar Dunclug, Tullyglass House Hotel and the overall programme sponsor Galgorm Resort and Spa. The theme for the teams this year are flowers and they are appropriately named as: The Teamkit Tulips, The Do-Jo Daffodils, The Doherty Meats Marigolds, The Fitzsimons Opticians Foxgloves, The Pizza Parlour Pansies, The Knockdene Healthcare Heathers, The Flamingo Forget Me Nots, The Sitting Room Snowdrops, the Studio  Sunflowers, The Steele Physio Primroses, the Prime Fitness Ponsettias and the Rafferty Property Roses.So over the next few weeksyou happen to see a group of Roses or Pansies jogging past you on the street give them a shout of encouragement and help them to bloom!

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family. I have spent more time with them this year than my own family.“Then there is the team in ICU. What these guys do is amazing. The extra care they give to the very sick people is out of this world.“I want to thank Vertex pharmaceuticals for finally giving in, eventhey were slow on the mark and I was too close to death for them to make the bloody decision but nevertheless.“I also want to thank my amazing family and friends for being there from day one and everyone who has followed my story.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

The passing of a mutual friend brought artist and writer in contact, which spurred Michael to research Ruby’s le. The play was developed with access and support from Ruby’s immediate family including her first husband Bernie Burgess, their son Tim Murray as well as creative support from, the late, well-known writer, director and actor Sam McCready.Looking forward to reviving her role as Ruby, actress Libby Smyth added: “It’s been a privilege for me to bring Ruby’s story to a wider audience and also to meet her family and hear their stories at first hand.

The -page document was published by Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney late on January , exactly three years on from the collapse of Stormont. All parties agreed to re-enter the Assembly the following day. It details how the Executive will benefit from increased funding for capital infrastructure investment as a result of the UK Government’s “infrastructure revolution”. Derry and the North West receives special mention throughout the document although the exact funding package has not been revealed. googletag.cmd.push Infrastructure funding will enable the Executive to invest in a range of potential capital projects, the document outlines, such as the A A roads Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry, subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project. Commenting on the news, Ulster University said: “We welcome the commitments within the deal to the development and expansion of our Magee campus and the establishment of the graduate entry medical school. “These commitments will bring enhancements for student opportunity, health  patient care.” Foundation Dean of the proposed Medical School, Louise Dubras added: “Campaigning stops setting up starts. googletag.cmd.push “I’m so looking forward to establishing the team to deliver Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgeryand selecting the first cohort of students. Advance notice to all my medical education colleagues out there, Derry is great place to live and work, and Ulster University will be recruiting.” The Government will make funding available for a range of projects aimed at supporting community and reconciliation initiatives to remove barriers, bring the people of Northern Ireland together and build a safer, more secure society in Northern Ireland. This “could include” areas such as additional funding to support mental health over three years, funding for tackling paramilitarism, to support a new Executive in tackling deprivation and improving opportunity. Once again Derry was explicitly mentioned in terms of funding to support the “Derry addiction centre”. It’s understood that is in reference to greater investment for Northland’s Addiction Centre. Infrastructure  Concurrently, the Irish government has pledged to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on this island – by road, rail and air. “We believe this is an immediate opportunity to move forward quickly together to deliver on plans to complete key infrastructure projects including the A and the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. “The Government will deliver on its funding commitments to those projects, including a total of pound million up to  for the A. “The Irish Government also intends to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.” The Government has also recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment, and that there is a clear argument for further enhancing cross-border cooperation and connections, to the benefit of all. The Irish Government welcomed the UK Government’s announcement to invest up to poundm in Derry and the North West through the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the Inclusive Future Fund. It is committed to exploring opportunities for investment that will further support opportunities to bring greater economic prosperity and social benefits to the wider region. “In this context, the Irish Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry,” the document reads. “This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. “The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government. “We look forward to early discussion at the North South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region,” it adds.  Foyle River Gardens As part of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership the Irish government is “ready to continue discussions” on key projects for employment and sustainable development in the region, including the Foyle River Gardens – described as Northern Ireland’s Eden project, after the popular visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The Government will also maintain the enhanced level of funding for the Reconciliation Fund at €. million per year in support of projects in Northern Ireland and border areas, with a focus on the most hard-to-reach and marginalised communities in terms of economic and social deprivation. “Ireland has consistently prioritised the continuation of EU PEACE funding including through ongoing engagement at EU level. We will continue work with our EU partners and the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the PEACE PLUS programme, building on and continuing the work of both PEACE and INTERREG, will be delivered through the Special EU Programmes Body in support of reconciliation and harnessing the opportunities of our peace for all,” it concludes.

There will be a lot more activity from the unusually quiet four piece I’m assured. Very little other craic at the minute. .Squakdon’t have anything organised yet man..Rebecca Mulhernhas nothing on except uni stuff. googletag.cmd.push .Paddy Nashis hinting a vinyl compilation of all his material later in the year. He also describes a few releases and some solo tours as nothing much. Luckily for them Paddy doesn’t compare himself to other artists. .Basorkhave an announcement to make soon. .Fast Thursdayare flat out recording an album at the minuteandhave very few gigs planned so far. .Ryan Vailhas new music lined up and loads of live shows. .George Huttontells me “Two next gigs coming up are the Ulster Hall in Belfast, th Feb. I’ll be releasing my new album in Feb also and on the th Feb I’ve a gig in St Columb’s Cathedral with Ruth McGinley and the Priests. I’ve been asked to be a judge on BBC School Choir of the year, and they want me to perform live on the BBC in the Guildhall before the final, but I haven’t been given a green light to put that out there yet! Hopefully will today or tomorrow! Man, the new album is a big step up, it’s very much down that Irish channel but it also really showcases what I do best”. googletag.cmd.push .Nazirtold me “Working on my next release which I’m hoping to have out in the next month or so, I’d love to playCeltronic again but I guess I won’t know about that for a while, some technical things with involve are holding us back but as soon as we get that sorted I’ll let u know!” .Caitlin Nashsaid, “I have no clue at the minute because I’m heading back to uni soon but I’m hoping to get a few projects done over there and here when I’m back in the summer”. . At some point we’ll work out why  People don’t get paid for playing gigs. . In April Reevahwill be releasing “A Dferent Light” and she’ll also be heading out on a UK Irish tour as well as putting the finishing touches on her debut album which will be out either by the end of this year or the start of next year. .Declan McLaughlinis feeling nostalgic and will be celebrating his entire career this year, from The Screaming Bin Lids to The Whole Tribe Sings to Central Drive to The Hi Flats, share the love on his Facebook page. . If you’re not really a fan of music then mrk my words, there’s plenty of bland music going live this year. .Roewill be releasing a couple of singles this year with an e.p. on its way after the summer.  Noella Hutton has a new album coming out soon.  .Noella Huttonhas a new album coming very soon called “Love  Liars” and you can check out the video for her video for “I’m Going Crazy” from that album on her Facebook page. .Bloodhaven’t gone away you know. . There will most likely be the same old same old from all the usual quarters but hopefully there’ll also be some of the usual standard of innovative stuff from the likes of Celtronic andOscillations  Modulations.

Gordon Lyonsand Declan Kearneywill serve as junior ministers.Alliance leader Naomi Long accepted the position of justice minister.Members of the executiveThe other members of the executive are: Minister for the economy: Diane Dodds , Minister for education: Peter Weir , Minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs: Edwin Poots , Minister for communities: Deirdre Hargey , Minister for finance: Conor Murphy , Minister for health: Robin Swann , Minister for infrastructure: Nichola Mallon .DferencesAddressing the assembly, Mrs Foster said the politicians have many dferences.Michelles narrative of the past  years could not be more dferent to mine, she said.Im not sure we will ever agree on much about the past, but we can agree there was too much suffering, and that we cannot allow society to drt backwards and allow ision to grow.Commitment to powerMichelle ONeill said it was her sincere wish that  brings real change.I see no contradiction in declaring and delivering on our firm commitment to power sharing with unionism in the Stormont Assembly while also initiating a mature and inclusive debate about new political arrangements which examine Irelands future beyond Brexit.Similarly, there is no contradiction in unionism working the existing constitutional arrangements while taking its rightful place in the conversation about what a new Ireland would look like.”‘Wonderful compromise’Visiting Belfast on Monday, Boris Johnson hailed the wonderful compromise that has seen theof devolution to Northern Ireland, after meeting Stormonts newly-appointed leaders in Belfast.The prime minister said Stormont was open for business again in the wake of the restoration of power-sharing following three years of political deadlock.Mr Johnson praised politicians from all sides in Northern Ireland, saying they had put aside their dferences, stepped up to the plate and showed leadership.I just want to say how grateful I am to all the parties, to everybody here in Northern Ireland, for the way they have compromised the way they have worked together to get Stormont up and running once again, he said.Its shown a willingness to trust each other and to set aside dferences and I think its absolutely commendable and wonderful to see.Never mind the hand of history on my shoulder... I see the hand of the future beckoning us all forward.And I hope that with goodwill and compromise and hard work on all sides it will be a very bright future indeed.The British government made a number of financial promises to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line.Major investmentNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith promised major investment to tackle problems in Northern Irelands struggling public services, but declined to confirm the sums involved until devolution was restored.Ministers at Stormont are now keen to nail down precise figures.There are reports the government could announce a poundbn package, but a Downing Street source has described this figure as just speculation.And Mr Johnson himself did not answer when asked by journalists about the poundbn figure.Additionally, the Irish government made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north south projects, such as the A dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system.‘Critical reforms’Speaking ahead of the discussions, Mr Johnson said they will focus on how the executive intended to take forward critical reforms to public services.This is an historic time for the people of Northern Ireland, he said.After three years, Stormont is open for business again with an executive who can now move forward with improving peoples lives and delivering for all communities in Northern Ireland.The previous DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in acrimony in January .The cause was a row about a botched green energy scheme, a dispute that later widened to include more traditional wrangles on issues like the Irish language and the legacy of the Troubles.Mr Johnson said in his news conference that there could be no repetition of the scandal.It is vital that public spending in Northern Ireland is properly invigilated and there is no repetition of that kind of thing, he said.The prime minister added that the new agreement contained provision for proper responsibility for the use of public funds. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In economic downturn, it is the one area where we are enjoying signicant success but there is potential for much more growth. It is our duty to seek to grow this revenue not stunt economic growth by dissuading visitors. Any plan to charge for car parking here would also necessitate gross improvement in public transport and ‘active travel’, such as our walking cycling infrastructure. Our businesses pay the highest rates in the UK. Our marina fees have been increasing for consecutive years. Our businesses need respite. They need certainty and solutions to the disproportionate rates burden that they carry. We have listened to them and they are genuinely worried about these proposed charges. Moreover, many of our workers in our coastal areas are seasonal and on minimum wage. The impact on these local communities would be detrimental.The group added that due consideration must be given to residents.It is especially mad to introduce such a scheme when no residents’ parking permit scheme is in place. We know that these can be fraught with dficulty and a fair scheme cannot be established overnight.The statement added: As elected representatives, we should also be promoting health and wellbeing, especially in the dawn of a new year. We ought to be encouraging our constituents to make the best of the outstanding natural resources that we are privileged to have on our doorsteps in this electoral area. Enforcing car parking charges at ideal locations for ‘time out’ and walks does nothing to encourage fitness or mindfulness.We don’t believe that Council’s consultation has been adequate.The SDLP group added that representatives had been flooded by emails from concerned residents, businesses and community groups.The added that hiking car parking charges would only result in a negativefor constituents. The charges are bad news for business, residents and tourists.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mallon admitted he consulted Parkhouse about the move before agreeing to move to Derry City. “He was here last season and the Derry fans will know all about him so he spoke quite highly of the league and said he had a great time here,” he explained.“When he came back he had put himself into a much better position than he was in before and that’s something that I want to do myself. He came here, he did really well and he’s held in high regard since he’s gone back and that’s something I’ll be look to doing myself.”Mallon, who can play in a number of positions, can usually be found on the left wing but has also been known to drop into full back comfortably. He spent part of  on loan in Australia’s A-League with the Central Coast Mariners making several first team appearances. The Belfast man has also represented both Northern Ireland and the Republic at international youth levels, and most recently he has featured for Stephen Kenny’s Irish U side. Mallon has not played in the League of Ireland before, but he certainly knows all about it. “I know a lot about the league,” he said. “Being in the international squad you get lads who are still in Ireland all the way through from when I went away with Ireland when I was  all the way through to . The lads were still at home playing football for their local teams or for a team in the League of Ireland.”Mallon joins Walter Figueira, Conor Clford and Connor McCormack as the new faces at the Brandywell this season, and with the new campaign just over a month away from kicking off, the newest addition to the City squad can’t wait to get going. “It’s a massive opportunity and I just want to take my chance and work hard to get in the team,” he stated. “Even though I’m coming over I know that nothing’s promised so I need to get myself in the team so hopefully I can get myself in the team, stay in the team and do well for the team and hopefully we can get some success this season.” googletag.cmd.push High hopesCity boss Declan Devine is confident that he has unearthed another Sheffield United gem, and expects Mallon to enjoy himself at Derry City as much as Parkhouse did in .“He’s a talented boy and someone I’ve known for a long time,” he explained. “It’s very similar to the Parkhouse situation last year in that it’s a Sheffield United player, a very technical player, a player with flair with a fantastic left foot who can play in midfield or the left wing and can also slot in at left back. He’s a player who gives us versatility, a player who saw the benefits of what David Parkhouse did here last year and he’s a guy who wants to prove himself at the highest level. “I’m delighted to welcome Stephen to the club because he’s going to be a great addition for us going foraard.

Midfielder Niall Grace has already left to join Bonagee United, and others could follow suit in the coming weeks as Connor demands more. He got his wish in part on Saturday, as his team came close to causing a huge shock at Glenavon.Without a win in eight games, Stute were headed to only their second league win of the season thanks to goals from Joe McCready and Alex Pomeroy, but second half replies from Daniel Purkis and Chad McClockey ensured the away side had to make do with a valuable point in their fight against relegation. googletag.cmd.push PenaltyAs expected, the game started with Glenavon on top and they should have taken an early lead as Josh Daniels found Dylan Davidson down the left, but the wingers low drive was saved by Rory Brown.After that early scare the Waterside men took the lead on  minutes from the penalty spot after Alex Pomeroy was brought down inside the box by Seamus Sharkey, a very late tackle by the former Derry City defender, which gave referee Christopher Morrison no choice but to point to the spot.Striker Joe McCready stepped up for the sixth time this season from  yards and calmly side footed low into the bottom right hand corner to give his team the lead. Glenavon pushed forward in search of an equaliser minutes later as Daniels right wing cross found Moorhouse at the back post, but the former Shelbourne man, saw his close range strike hit the side netting.Just after the half-hour mark Sharkey went close to making up for giving away the penalty, but the ex-Sligo Rovers mans shot from just inside the six yard box, was saved by a combination of Rory Brown and Curry.The home side were well on top and they went close to levelling things just before the break, but after a scramble James Singletons header was nodded over the bar by Curry. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The dominance continued after the break and Glenavon should have levelled when Sharkey’s close range header flew off target, after Sammy Clingan’s corner had picked out the defender.Institute were hanging on but they should have doubled their advantage two minutes later after McCready released Pomeroy, but the young striker’s side footed strike from close range was saved by Tuffey.Pomeroy made up for the miss just moments later as the visitors stunned the home side by going two goals in front, the young striker waltzing through the home side’s defence, before cooly side footing home past Tuffey.Glenavon were lucky to be in the game as another opportunity came and went for Stute, but after a super turn inside the box Gareth Brown, he was denied by smart Tuffey save.The hosts did pull a goal back on  minutes as Caolan Marron’s right wing cross into the near post was superbly turned home by an unmarked Purkis, giving the home side a leline.Stute were unable to hang onto their lead however as McCloskey levelled things on  minutes as Clingan’s corner was headed goalward by James Singleton and it was the substitute who eventually forced the ball over the line.Deep into stoppage time Glenavon should have won the game as a chance fell for Daniels, but after getting free inside the box the winger fired just wide with the goal at his mercy.All things considered, this was not a bad point for Institute. TeamsGlenavon: Tuffey, Larmour, Marron, Daniels, Moorhouse , Clingan, Purkis, Snoddy, Singleton, Davidson , Sharkey . Institute: R Brown, Brogan, D Curry, McLaughlin, R Morrow G Brown, Crown, Tweed, Burke , Pomeroy , McCready .

Preparations are underway for the new season which starts in April and, although there is some disappointment that the replacement building won’t be ready for this season, members are looking forward to moving into new surroundings in . The club has a long history stretching back to  - it closed in  because of its close proximity to the Rosemount RUC barracks during the Troubles - before reopening in . Club Secretary, Jimmy Hagan, said the current clubhouse should be “condemned” as it is “not fit for purpose”. A considerable amount of money has been spent on roof repairs in recent times. googletag.cmd.push Issues with the roof and damp have been ongoing for six or seven years, Mr Hagan explained. At one point a part of the pavilion roof collapsed because of a leak. He is happy that Derry City and Strabane District Council has given assurances around a replacement building. Mr Hagan said: “The council has agreed to give us the same footprint as the clubhouse we have at the minute. We wanted a bigger club house on account of women now playing alongside men at the club. “We wanted additional facilities for the ladies and an indoor mat for the winter. They’ve agreed to give us a clubhouse with a similar footprint but with adjustments inside to accommodate the ladies.” googletag.cmd.push When September arrives the group is normally split up and they don’t see one another, however, an indoor mat included as part of the rebuild will allow club members to meet and play all year round. Long-term plans are being assessed to redevelop the Brooke Park Community Centre and the bowling club may feature in that, but new facilities will ensure the club is properly facilitated for the next - years. The club was hoping that new facilities would be in place for the new season which commences in April but they were informed that planning and design would take some time. The season ends in September therefore work will not begin until then to avoid any interference. Sinn Feacutein Councillor for the Rosemount area, Mickey Cooper, has worked closely with the club over the years and in October  he welcomed confirmation of pound, for a replacement building with a new structure. He said: “The new facility will provide proper changing facilities for both the male and female members of the club and can also be used by other local groups.” The club is presently based in portacabins but the new facility will be upgraded to prefabricated modular buildings, Cllr Cooper explained. It is at the procurement stage and he said plans will be brought back to club members for their approval with a meeting set to take place in the coming weeks. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council advised that the plans for a proposed new building at the Bowling Green in Brooke Park will be going ahead and the works are currently being “scoped out and designed”.

The result is Belfast: City of Light, a new book in which she shares her experiences and asks some pertinent questions on matters of faith and beliefs.Bronagh began her journey as a non-churchgoer. Now, she says she is a dferent person.ldquoI did not set out to go on this journey or write this book, but simply started to follow an artistic thread like many artists over the centuries before me, she remarked. ldquoThe thread became so compelling and extraordinary that I eventually felt destined to write it down.Born in Newtownards in  to Frances and Paddy Lawson, who had ed to Belfast to oversee the design and building of the Ulster Museum, Bronagh spent her first two years on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast with her three older sisters, before moving to Portaferry in  and later to Strangford.Educated at Down High School, in  she attended art college in Bristol and then gained a first class degree in textiles fashion at Winchester School of Art, Hampshire. Moving to London on graduation, she won a Fulbright scholarship and attended Parsons School of Design in New York.Bronagh sometimes visited Northern Ireland and despaired. Prior to the end of the Troubles she spent time as a participant on ious cross-community development programmes before deciding to use her creativity in a dferent way.For  years she set up and ran cross-border, cross-community development programmes mostly within the enterprise sector in interfaceareas of Belfast. At the same time she explored her own upbringing during the Troubles and heard many stories from people in Belfast of experience she only saw on TV growing up and often switched off in horror.She spent three years based in North Belfast, between the republican New Lodge and loyalist Tigers Bay areas. Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue.

This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
